Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included under Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nAs the leading local business review site in the United States, we offer consumers unmatched local business information, as well as a convenient platform on which they can discover, engage and transact with local businesses to meet their everyday needs. Our value proposition to businesses is simple: we provide the opportunity to connect with the millions of purchase-intent driven consumers through our ad products; messaging features, such as Request-A-Quote; the Yelp Platform, our transaction platform; and retention tools, among other ways.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of advertising products. In the year ended December 31, 2017, our net revenue was $846.8 million, which represented an increase of 19% from the year ended December 31, 2016, and we recorded net income of $152.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of $156.6 million. In the year ended December 31, 2016, our net revenue was $713.1 million, which represented an increase of 30% from the year ended December 31, 2015, and we recorded a net loss of $4.7 million and adjusted EBITDA of $120.1 million.\nOur success is primarily the result of significant investment in our communities, employees, content, brand and technology. We believe that continued investment in our business provides our largest opportunity for future growth and plan to continue investing for long-term growth by focusing on the following priorities in 2018:\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Driving Monetization. In 2017, the expansion of our self-serve sales channel and scaling of our customer success team led to improvements in our ability to attract and retain advertisers. In 2018, we plan to build on these efforts by offering our full-serve customers flexible advertising terms and customization options previously available only to self-serve customers. We believe this will result in a more efficient sales process and encourage businesses to try advertising on our platform. While this may result in higher turnover rates for new advertisers, we believe it will ultimately be outweighed by the resulting increase in customer satisfaction and our improved revenue retention abilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Generating Strong Usage and Engagement. Although we plan to continue investing in performance marketing in 2018, organic growth driven by our community development efforts continues to be the primary driver of our traffic. To that end, in 2018 we plan to expand our community management team to the neighborhood level by introducing Neighborhood\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmbassadors to some of our most established markets, such as the Bay Area, New York and Boston. We also plan to continue our consumer protection efforts to safeguard the integrity of our reviews and our reputation.\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Strengthening Our Competitive Position in the Restaurant Category. Our restaurants category receives the most traffic and reviews of any category on our platform. To strengthen our competitive advantage in this important area, we plan to invest in our Yelp Reservations and Yelp Nowait products by further integrating their functionality into our core user experience. We also expect to complete our integration of Grubhub's restaurant network by mid-2018, which will increase the number and quality of restaurants offering online ordering through the Yelp Platform. We anticipate that our investments in this area will result in increased sales and marketing and product development expenses in 2018, but believe that they are critical to our future success.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Building Out Our Home & Local Services Offering. In 2017, our Request-A-Quote feature helped drive growth in our largest category by revenue, Home & Local Service, both by facilitating connections between consumers and businesses and as an engine of financial growth through our existing cost-per-click ad model. In 2018, we plan to further refine the product through improvements to the process by which we match consumers initiating requests with businesses, among other things. We are also exploring new ways to monetize Request-A-Quote that better reflect the value of these high-converting leads.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We expect to continue to invest in capital expenditures in 2018 to support the growth of our business, primarily to increase our office space, upgrade our technology and infrastructure to improve the ability of our platform to handle the projected increase in usage, and enable the release of new features and solutions. As a result of this investment philosophy, we expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nTraffic and User Engagement. We derive substantially all of our revenue from advertising, and traffic to our platform determines the number of ads we are able to show, affects the value of those ads to businesses and influences the content creation that drives further traffic. As a result, our ability to grow our business depends on our ability to increase traffic on our platform, which in turn depends on, among other things, the quality of our content and the prominence of links to our platform in Internet search engine results and application marketplaces. The number of users we attract from search engines in particular can be affected by a number of factors not in our direct control; changes in a search engine's ranking algorithms, methodologies or design layouts may result in links to our website not being prominent enough to drive traffic to our website and mobile app.\nWe anticipate that our traffic growth will continue to slow over time, and potentially decrease in certain periods, as our business matures and we achieve higher penetration rates in our core markets of the United States and Canada. We also expect the cyclicality and seasonality in our business to become more pronounced as our business matures, including weaker traffic in the fourth quarter of the year. As our traffic growth rate slows, our success will become increasingly dependent on our ability to increase levels of user engagement on our platform, which itself depends on the quality of our content and our ability to introduce new and improved products that effectively address consumer needs, among other things.\nOur Ability to Attract and Retain Advertisers. Our revenue growth is driven by our ability to attract and retain advertising customers. To do so, we must deliver compelling ad products in an effective manner, at prices that compare favorably to those of our competitors. Our advertisers typically do not have long-term obligations to purchase our products, and an increasing portion have the ability to cancel their ad campaigns at any time. Their decisions to renew depend on the degree of satisfaction with our products as well as a number of factors that are outside of our control, including their ability to continue their operations and spending levels. The small and medium-sized businesses on which we heavily rely often have limited advertising budgets and may be disproportionately affected by economic downturns. As a result, a worsening economic outlook would likely cause businesses to decrease investments in advertising, which could adversely affect our revenue.\nOur ability to maintain and expand our advertiser base also depends on the size and productivity of our sales force and customer success team. As we continue to invest in expanding our sales organization, we must efficiently scale our operations while at the same time recruiting, training and integrating new hires and developing, motivating and retaining existing employees. Similarly, in order to retain, and take advantage of opportunities to deepen our relationships with, our existing customers, we must continue our efforts to build out our customer success team. Developing our account retention processes will be particularly important as an increasing portion of our advertisers have the ability to cancel their contracts at any time. In addition, as we make periodic adjustments to our sales organization to respond to market opportunities and to pursue initiatives to increase productivity, such changes may result in a temporary lack of focus or disruption to our operations. For example, it may take time for our sales and customer success organizations to adapt to selling and supporting advertising contracts with flexible cancellation terms.\nProduct Innovation. We must deliver innovative, relevant and useful products to consumers and businesses - including products for mobile and other alternative devices - to expand the size and engagement of our user base, attract advertisers and\nincrease our revenue. We plan to continue investing in new product development as we introduce new advertising and e-commerce products, explore new platforms and distribution channels, and develop partner arrangements that provide incremental value to our users and advertisers to encourage them to increase their usage of, and the portion of their advertising budgets allocated to, our platform. As our industry evolves and competition intensifies, our investments may increasingly include products and services outside of our historical core business, such as our planned investments in Yelp Reservations, Yelp Nowait and Yelp WiFi Marketing in 2018. These investments involve significant risks and uncertainties, such as distracting management, and may ultimately fail to generate sufficient revenue or other value to justify our investments in them.\nInvestment in Growth. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, aggressively to support the growth of our communities and platform. We dedicate significant resources to areas such as: marketing and community development; consumer protection; maintaining and enhancing the Yelp brand; and upgrading our systems, technology and network infrastructure to accommodate growth. Our investment plans for 2018 include the neighborhood-level expansion of our community management team and continuing our performance marketing program aimed at attracting more users and advertisers. We expect that these investments will increase our operating expenses, and that any increase in revenue resulting from product innovations will likely trail the increase in expenses.\nStock Repurchases. In July 2017, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $200 million of our outstanding common stock. We repurchased on the open market 302 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $12.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. We funded these repurchases, and expect to fund any future repurchases under the stock repurchase program, with cash available on our balance sheet. As a result, this program could diminish our cash reserves in addition to affecting the trading price and volatility of our stock.\nCorporate Development Activities. As part of our business strategy, we may decide to expand our product offerings and grow our business through the acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies. We may also sell existing business lines or technologies, as we did with our Yelp Eat24 business, which we sold to Grubhub in October 2017. In addition to diverting our management's attention and otherwise disrupting our operations, our corporate development activities will affect our future financial results due to factors such as expenses incurred in identifying, investigating and pursuing transactions, whether or not they are consummated, possible dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, unidentified liabilities and the amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the key metrics set forth below, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. Unless otherwise stated, these metrics do not include metrics for Yelp Eat24, Yelp Reservations, Yelp Nowait, Yelp WiFi Marketing or from our business owner products.\nReviews\nNumber of reviews represents the cumulative number of reviews submitted to Yelp since inception, as of the period end, including reviews that were not recommended or had been removed from our platform. In addition to the text of the review, each review includes a rating of one to five stars. We include reviews that are not recommended and that have been removed because all of them are either currently accessible on our platform or were accessible at some point in time, providing information that may be useful to users to evaluate businesses and individual reviewers. Because our automated recommendation software continually reassesses which reviews to recommend based on new information that becomes available, the recommended\u201d or not recommended\u201d status of reviews may change over time. Reviews that are not recommended or that have been removed do not factor into a business's overall star rating. By clicking on a link on a reviewed business's page on our website, users can access the reviews that are not currently recommended for the business, as well as the star rating and other information about reviews that were removed for violation of our terms of service.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately 137.7 million reviews were available on business listing pages, including approximately 31.7 million reviews that were not recommended, after 10.6 million reviews had been removed from our platform, either by us for violation of our terms of service or by the users who contributed them. The following table presents the number of cumulative reviews as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reviews\n</td> <td>148,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,210\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTraffic\nTraffic to our website and mobile app has three components: visitors to our non-mobile optimized website (our desktop website\u201d), visitors to our mobile-optimized website (our mobile website\u201d) and mobile devices accessing our mobile app. We use the following metrics to measure each of these traffic streams:\nDesktop and Mobile Website Unique Visitors. We calculate desktop unique visitors as the number of users,\u201d as measured by Google Analytics, who have visited our desktop website at least once in a given month, averaged over a given three-month period. Similarly, we calculate mobile website unique visitors as the number of users\u201d who have visited our mobile website at least once in a given month, averaged over a given three-month period.\nGoogle Analytics, a product from Google Inc. that provides digital marketing intelligence, measures users\u201d based on unique cookie identifiers. Because the numbers of desktop unique visitors and mobile website unique visitors are therefore based on unique cookies, an individual who accesses our desktop website or mobile website from multiple devices with different cookies may be counted as multiple desktop unique visitors or mobile website unique visitors, as applicable, and multiple individuals who access our desktop website or mobile website from a shared device with a single cookie may be counted as a single desktop unique visitor or mobile website unique visitor.\nApp Unique Devices. We calculate app unique devices as the number of unique mobile devices using our mobile app in a given month, averaged over a given three-month period. Under this method of calculation, an individual who accesses our mobile app from multiple mobile devices will be counted as multiple app unique devices. Multiple individuals who access our mobile app from a shared device will be counted as a single app unique device.\nWe anticipate that our mobile traffic will be the driver of our growth for the foreseeable future.\nThe following table presents our traffic for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Desktop Unique Visitors\n</td> <td>76,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,607\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mobile Web Unique Visitors\n</td> <td>64,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,860\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>App Unique Devices\n</td> <td>28,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,006\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs previously reported, a portion of our desktop traffic, as measured by Google Analytics, since the third quarter of 2016 has been attributable to a single robot. Because the traffic from this robot does not represent valid consumer traffic, we have adjusted the number of desktop unique visitors we are reporting above to remove such traffic to provide greater accuracy and transparency. For additional information, please see the risk factor included under Part I, Item 1A under the heading We rely on data from both internal tools and third parties to calculate certain of our performance metrics. Real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\u201d\nClaimed Local Business Locations\nThe number of claimed local business locations represents the cumulative number of business locations that have been claimed on Yelp worldwide since 2008, as of a given date. We define a claimed local business location as each business address for which a business representative has visited our website and claimed the free business listing page for the business located at that address. The following table presents the number of cumulative claimed local business locations as of the dates presented (in thousands):\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Claimed Local Business Locations\n</td> <td>4,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,648\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPaying Advertising Accounts\nPaying advertising accounts comprise all business accounts from which we recognized advertising revenue in a given three-month period. As with our advertising revenue classification, paying advertising accounts excludes subscription services customers that are not also advertising customers. The following table presents the number of paying advertising accounts during the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paying Advertising Accounts\n</td> <td>163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, we have also disclosed below EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We have included EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our primary business operations. Accordingly, we believe that EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In particular, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income should not be viewed as substitutes for, or superior to, net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Some of these limitations are:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income do not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income do not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income do not reflect the impact of the valuation allowance recording or release;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Because of these limitations, you should consider EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income alongside other financial performance measures, including net income (loss), and our other GAAP results. The tables below present reconciliations of net income (loss) to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income , the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in each case, for each of the periods indicated.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: provision for (benefit from) income taxes; other (income) expense, net; and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $220.7 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: provision for (benefit from) income taxes; other income (expense), net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; gain on disposal of a business unit; and restructuring and integration costs. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $156.6 million.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,670\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32,900\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,068\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>31,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25,193\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>838\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>(4,864\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,694\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(386\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(221\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>407\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>41,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>220,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>100,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposal of a business unit\n</td> <td>(164,779\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and integration costs(1)\n</td> <td>288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Restructuring and integration includes $0.6 million in stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2013.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Net Income\nNon-GAAP net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as GAAP net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: stock-based compensation expense; amortization of intangibles; the tax effect of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, restructuring and integration costs, gain on disposal of a business unit and valuation allowance; and certain other non-recurring items, such as restructuring and integration costs accounted for in 2016 and 2017, and gain on disposal of a business unit accounted for in 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $80.2 million and $59.4 million, respectively.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, website and internal-use software development costs, business combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes and stock-based compensation expense have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on these and our other significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net revenue for those periods.

We generate advertising revenue from our advertising programs, which consist of enhanced listing pages and performance and impression-based advertising in search results and elsewhere on our website and mobile app. Advertising revenue also includes revenue generated from resale of our advertising products by certain partners and monetization of remnant advertising inventory through third-party ad networks. We expect our advertising revenue to continue to increase, as our sales force focuses on both increasing the number of paying advertising accounts and grow revenue generated from existing advertisers.\nTransactions. We generate revenue from various transactions with consumers, including transactions placed through our partner integrations, the sale of Yelp Deals and Gift Certificates and, through October 10, 2017, Yelp Eat24 transactions. Following our sale of Eat24 to Grubhub on October 10, 2017, we generate revenue from transactions placed through the Grubhub restaurant network, including Eat24 restaurants, that originate on Yelp pursuant to our partnership agreement with Grubhub.\nOur partnership integrations are revenue-sharing arrangements that provide consumers with the ability to complete food ordering and delivery transactions, order flowers and book spa and salon appointments, among others, through third parties directly on Yelp. We earn a fee for acting as an agent for transactions placed through these integrations, which we record on a net basis and include in revenue upon completion of a transaction.\nPrior to the completion of our sale of Eat24, we generated revenue from our Yelp Eat24 business through arrangements with restaurants in which restaurants pay a commission percentage fee on orders placed through the Yelp Eat24 platform, which we recorded on a net basis. Following the completion of the sale, we no longer recognize revenue from Yelp Eat24 as a standalone product. Instead, under our partnership agreement with Grubhub, we earn fees on food orders placed through the Grubhub restaurant network, including Eat24 restaurants, that originate on the Yelp Platform. We expect the revenue generated under the Grubhub arrangement to continue to be lower than the revenue previously generated by Yelp Eat24 for the foreseeable future, particularly before the remainder of the Grubhub restaurant network is fully integrated onto our platform, which is currently targeted to occur by mid-2018. Accordingly, our sale of Eat24 has resulted in a reduction in our transactions revenue and slowing of our total net revenue growth following the sale.\nYelp Deals allow merchants to promote themselves and offer discounted goods and services on a real-time basis to consumers directly on our website and mobile app. We earn a fee on Yelp Deals for acting as an agent in these transactions, which we record on a net basis and recognize as revenue upon a consumer's purchase of a deal. Gift Certificates allow merchants to sell full-priced gift certificates directly to consumers through their business listing pages. We earn a fee based on the amount of the Gift Certificate sold, which we record on a net basis and recognize as revenue upon a consumer's purchase of the Gift Certificate.\nOther Services. We generate revenue through our Yelp Reservations and Yelp Nowait products, the Yelp WiFi Marketing analytics platform, licensing payments for access to Yelp data through our Yelp Knowledge program and other non-advertising related partnerships.\nBrand Advertising. Through the end of 2015, we generated revenue from brand advertising through the sale of display advertisements and brand sponsorships to national brands. We phased out these products to focus on our core strength of local advertising.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of our net revenue for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to\n2017 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to\n2016 %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue by product:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>771,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>645,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>471,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transactions\n</td> <td>60,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other services\n</td> <td>14,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brand advertising\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>846,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>713,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>549,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of total net revenue by product:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transactions\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other services\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brand advertising\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net revenue\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2017, 2016 and 2015, we focused on revenue growth related to our local advertiser customer base. Total net revenue increased $133.7 million, or 19%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $163.4 million, or 30%, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nAdvertising revenue increased $126.4 million, or 20%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $173.8 million, or 37%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in both periods was primarily due to a significant increase in the number of customers purchasing advertising plans as we expanded our sales force to reach more businesses. The growth in both periods was driven primarily by purchases of cost-per-click advertising. In each of 2017, 2016 and 2015, a majority of ad clicks were delivered on mobile.\nOur transactions revenue decreased $2.2 million, or 4%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $18.6 million, or 43%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in 2017 was a result of our sale of Eat24 to Grubhub in October 2017, as we no longer recognized revenue from transactions from Yelp Eat24. The increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily the result of increased transactions from Yelp Eat24, which was acquired in February 2015.\nOur other services revenue increased $9.6 million, or 180%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $1.9 million, or 56%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to the acquisitions of Nowait and Turnstyle as well as increased revenue from Yelp Reservations. The increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases in revenue from Yelp Reservations.\nAs of the beginning of 2016, we no longer offer brand advertising products. As a result, we generated no brand advertising revenue in 2017 or 2016.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of credit card processing fees, web hosting costs and employee costs (including stock-based compensation expense) for our infrastructure teams related to the operation of our website and mobile app. It also includes confirmation services costs associated with Yelp Reservations, Yelp Nowait and Yelp WiFi Marketing, confirmation and delivery services associated with Yelp Eat24 prior to its sale, as well as video production costs for our advertising customers. Following our sale of Eat24 in October 2017, there was an initial reduction in our cost of revenue associated with credit card transactions,\nas well as confirmation and delivery services. We expect cost of revenue associated with our advertising customers to increase in 2018 as we increase the number of customers, offset by a reduction in cost of revenue associated with our transactions business as a result of our disposal of Eat24.\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to\n2017 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to\n2016 %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net revenue\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue increased $10.2 million, or 17%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $9.3 million, or 18%, in 2016 compared to 2015. Website infrastructure expense increased $5.4 million and $1.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, which primarily consists of website hosting and employee-related costs associated with employees supporting the hosting of the website. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in the number of visitors to, and increased transactions completed on, our website compared to the prior year, as well as increased headcount for personnel supporting the website infrastructure. The increase in website infrastructure expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was comparatively less than that of 2017 compared to 2016 due to reduced server hosting costs achieved from improved pricing from key website hosting vendors.\nCost of revenue also increased by $3.1 million and $0.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, compared to the prior year periods, as a result of increases in confirmation services and third-party food delivery costs. The increase in 2017 was due to an increase in the number of Yelp Eat24 transactions, and increased confirmation services expenses associated with Yelp Reservations, as well as Yelp Nowait and Yelp WiFi Marketing following our acquisitions of Nowait and Turnstyle. Additionally, cost of revenue increased in 2017 and 2016 as a result of increases of $2.4 million and $6.9 million, respectively, in merchant fees related to credit card transactions due to growth in advertising and transactions revenue. The rate of increase in these costs in 2017 was lower than the increase in 2016 as a result of the sale of Yelp Eat24 in 2017, and the slower growth rate in advertising revenue that year. In 2017, set up and creative design costs decreased by $0.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in video production costs. In 2016, set up and creative design costs increased by $1.2 million due to greater demand by businesses for video on their business listing pages.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee costs (including incentive compensation expense and stock-based compensation expense) for our sales and marketing employees. In addition, sales and marketing expenses include business and consumer acquisition marketing, community management, branding and advertising costs, as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs.\nFollowing our disposal of Eat24 to Grubhub in October 2017, we ceased marketing activities related to Yelp Eat24 and over 300 Yelp Eat24 sales and marketing employees transferred to Grubhub. While we have redeployed the remaining sales employees and resources previously associated with Eat24 within our organization, the Eat24 sale resulted in an initial reduction in our sales and marketing expenses. However, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we expand our communities, increase the number of advertising and subscription accounts and continue to build the Yelp brand in the United States and Canada. We expect the majority of sales and marketing expense increases for the foreseeable future to be related to hiring sales employees, as well as to costs incurred with various third-party media outlets and other advertising channels.\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to\n2017 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to\n2016 %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>438,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>382,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net revenue\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expenses increased $55.8 million, or 15%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $81.1 million, or 27%, in 2016 compared 2015. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily attributable to $42.8 million and $48.5 million, respectively, in additional salaries benefits, travel and other related expenses resulting from increases in headcount, including increases in stock-based compensation expense of $1.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively, as we expanded our sales organization to increase the number of paying advertising accounts and grow revenue from existing customers in the United States and Canada. We also experienced increases in facilities and other overhead allocations of $6.1 million and $10.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as we leased additional office space and incurred additional costs for our expanding headcount. As a result of our increases in net\nrevenue, our commission expenses increased by $4.6 million and $7.8 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, as a result of ongoing business and consumer marketing campaigns, marketing and advertising costs increased by $2.3 million and $14.8 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nProduct Development\nOur product development expenses primarily consist of employee costs (including stock-based compensation expense) for our engineers, product management and information technology personnel. In addition, product development expenses include outside services and consulting costs, as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We believe that continued investment in features, software development tools and code modification is important to attaining our strategic objectives and, as a result, we expect product development expenses to continue to increase for the foreseeable future. Although our sale of Eat24 will reduce our product development expenses associated with the Yelp Eat24 product, we have redeployed the associated internal resources elsewhere within our organization and do not expect the sale to have a material impact on our overall product development expenses as a result.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to\n2017 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to\n2016 %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net revenue\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct development expenses increased $37.2 million, or 27%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $30.8 million, or 29%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily attributable to $30.4 million and $27.9 million, respectively, in additional salaries and benefits associated with an increase in headcount, including increases in stock-based compensation expense (net of capitalized stock-based compensation expense) of $11.0 million and $12.9 million, respectively. In addition, we experienced increases in facilities and other overhead allocations of $6.0 million and $5.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as we leased additional office space and incurred additional costs for our expanding headcount.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee costs (including stock-based compensation expense) for our executive, finance, user operations, legal, human resources and other administrative employees. Our general and administrative expenses also include bad debt expenses, outside consulting, legal and accounting services, as well as facilities other supporting overhead costs. We expect bad debt expenses to increase as our advertising revenue continues to grow, and our other general and administrative costs should also increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our business. We do not expect our disposal of Eat24 to have a material impact on our general and administrative costs.\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to\n2017 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to\n2016 %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net revenue\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $8.2 million, or 8%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $16.6 million, or 21%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily attributable to $5.7 million and $12.1 million, respectively, in additional salaries, benefits, travel and related expenses associated with an increase in headcount, including increases in stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively. In 2017, the increase was also driven by an increase in one-time bonuses incurred in the year. Bad debt expense increased by $1.0 million in 2017 and $5.6 million in 2016 due to continued growth in advertising revenue. The rate of increase in bad debt expense in 2017 was less than that of 2016 as a result of improved collections rates from advertising customers.\nIn 2017, the use of outside consultants increased by $1.4 million as we invested in our systems and support for the growth of the business. In 2016, there was a decrease in consulting costs of $2.6 million due to decreased reliance on outside consultants. Facilities and other related allocations in 2017 were consistent with those in the prior year. We experienced an increase in facilities and other overhead allocations of $1.5 million in 2016, as a result of the increase in headcount.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on computer equipment, software, leasehold improvements, capitalized website and software development costs and amortization of purchased intangible assets. We expect depreciation expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our technology infrastructure, and lease additional office space. Amortization expense is likely to be lower for the foreseeable future as a result of the disposition of intangible assets in our sale of Eat24 to Grubhub in October 2017.\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to\n2017 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to\n2016 %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net revenue\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $5.9 million, or 17%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $5.7 million, or 19%, in 2016 compared to 2015.

Depreciation and amortization expenses related to our property, equipment and capitalized website and software development costs increased $6.1 million and $5.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRestructuring and Integration\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to\n2017 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to\n2016 %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and integration\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net revenue\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn November 2, 2016, we announced plans to significantly reduce sales and marketing activities in markets outside of the United States and Canada. The restructuring plan was substantially completed by December 31, 2016. We incurred $0.3 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in restructuring and integration costs associated with this plan related to severance costs for affected employees. No further expense for this plan is expected after December 31, 2017.

Income tax expense increased $30.1 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the gain on disposal of a business unit. Income tax expense decreased $10.6 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the valuation allowance recorded in 2015 against certain deferred tax assets.\nIt is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months there may be sufficient positive evidence to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance. Release of this valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the net income that we are able to actually achieve. We will continue to evaluate the possible release of valuation allowance on a quarterly basis.\nQuarterly Results of Operations and Other Data\nThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2017 (in thousands, except per share data). We also present other financial and operational data and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. We have prepared this quarterly data on a consistent basis with the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. In the opinion of management, the quarterly financial information reflects all necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of this data. This information should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period.\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, money market funds and investments with original maturities of less than three months. Our cash held internationally as of December 31, 2017 was $6.4 million. We did not have any outstanding bank loans or credit facilities in place as of December 31, 2017. Our investment portfolio comprises highly rated marketable securities, and our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires securities to be investment grade (i.e. rated \u2018A' or higher by bond rating firms) with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. To date, we have been able to finance our operations and our acquisitions through proceeds from private and public financings, including our initial public offering in March 2012, our follow-on offering in October 2013, cash generated from operations and, to a lesser extent, cash provided by the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended ( ESPP\u201d). In addition, on October 10, 2017, we completed our sale of Eat24 to Grubhub and received $252.7 million in cash, with an additional $28.8 million that is currently being held in escrow for an 18-month period after closing to secure our indemnification obligations in connection with the sale.\nOur future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with any cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and anticipated purchases of property and equipment for at least the next 12 months. However, this estimate is based on a number of assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could exhaust our available cash and cash equivalents earlier than presently anticipated. We may require or otherwise seek additional funds in the next 12 months to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features and products or enhance existing services, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies, and, accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds.\nAmounts deposited with third-party financial institutions exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance limits, as applicable. These cash and cash equivalents could be impacted if the underlying\nfinancial institutions fail or are subjected to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>167,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>79,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55,572\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(158,682\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>27,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities.

Purchases of property, equipment and software may vary from period to period due to the timing of the expansion of our offices, operations and website and internal-use software and development. We expect our investment in property and equipment, leasehold assets and the development of software in 2018 to grow from 2017 levels.\nWe generated $79.9 million of cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash provided by investing activities primarily related to $252.7 million net cash received for the sale of Eat24 to Grubhub on October 10, 2017 and $264.0 million of maturities of investment securities held-to-maturity. Cash provided by investing was offset by purchases of marketable securities of $354.9 million, purchases of property, equipment and software of $15.6 million to support the growth in our business, expenditures related to website and internally developed software of $14.6 million, as well as our acquisition of Nowait for net cash consideration of $30.8 million, which included intangible assets of $12.7 million, and our acquisition of Turnstyle for net cash consideration of $19.7 million, which included intangible assets of $4.3 million.\nWe used $55.6 million of cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash used in investing activities primarily related to purchases of marketable securities of $275.0 million, expenditures related to website and internally developed software of $14.2 million, purchases of property, equipment and software of $23.0 million to support the growth in our business, our investment of $8.0 million in the preferred stock of Nowait and purchases of intangible data licenses of $0.2 million. In addition, as part of our lease agreements for additional office space, we were obligated to deliver additional letters of credit, which resulted in an increase of $0.8 million in restricted cash. Cash used in investing was offset by $265.5 million of maturities of investment securities held-to-maturity.\nWe used $158.7 million of cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash used in investing activities primarily related to the $73.4 million cash portion of the purchase price of Eat24, purchases of marketable securities of $246.2 million, expenditures related to website and internally developed software of $11.7 million, purchases of intangible data licenses of $0.6 million and purchases of property, equipment, software and leasehold improvements of $31.1 million to support the growth in our business. Cash used in investing was offset by $202.9 million of maturities of investment securities held-to-maturity and the release of restrictions on cash of $1.4 million.\nFinancing Activities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $27.2 million in financing activities, primarily due to net proceeds of $30.0 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and $10.9 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock under the ESPP. Cash provided by financing activities was offset by $12.6 million in repurchases of common stock and $1.2 million of taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards for our international employees.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated $29.5 million in financing activities, primarily due to net proceeds of $20.6 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and $8.9 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock under the ESPP.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated $26.4 million in financing activities, primarily due to net proceeds of $12.3 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options, $8.9 million in net proceeds from the sale of stock under our ESPP and $6.6 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based award activity.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn July 2017, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $200 million of our outstanding common stock. We may purchase shares at our discretion in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, in transactions structured through investment banking institutions, or a combination of the foregoing. The program is not subject to any time limit and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. The amount and timing of repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including liquidity, cash flow and market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased 302,206 shares on the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $12.6 million and had retired 301,106 of these shares as of December 31, 2017; the remaining treasury shares were subsequently retired in 2018. We funded these repurchases, and expect to fund any future repurchases under the stock repurchase program, with cash available on our balance sheet, which will continue to increase the cash used in investing activities.\nNet Share Settlement of Equity Awards\nIn 2017, we began settling the employee tax liabilities associated with the vesting of RSUs through net share withholding - rather than selling a portion of the vested shares to cover taxes, as we had previously - for international employees. As a result, we paid $1.2 million of employee taxes out of cash held on our consolidated balance sheet. Although we continued to sell a portion of vested shares to cover such taxes for U.S.-based employees in 2017, we intend to begin net share withholding for them as well in 2018, which will result in an increase in cash used in financing activities in 2018.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 303(a)(4)(ii) promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act, in 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nContractual Obligations\nWe lease various office facilities, including our corporate headquarters in San Francisco, California, under operating lease agreements that expire from 2018 to 2029. The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease periods. We do not have any debt or material capital lease obligations, and all of our property, equipment and software have been purchased with cash. As of December 31, 2017, we had no material long-term purchase obligations outstanding with vendors or third parties other than obligations related to the fit out of certain leasehold properties. As of December 31, 2017, the following table summarizes our future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases and purchase obligations for equipment and office facilities (in thousands):\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>332,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with binding agreements and do not include obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, our total liability for uncertain tax positions was $3.4 million of the total unrecognized benefit of $18.2 million. We are not reasonably able to estimate the timing of future cash flow related to this liability. As a result, this amount is not included in the contractual obligations table above.\nWe have subleased certain office facilities under operating lease agreements that expire in 2021. The terms of these lease agreements provide for rental receipts on a graduated basis. We recognize sublease rentals on a straight-line basis over the lease periods reflected as a reduction in rental expense. As of December 31, 2017, our future minimum rental receipts to be received under non-cancelable subleases were $6.5 million.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included under Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nAs the leading local business review site in the United States, we offer consumers unmatched local business information, as well as a convenient platform on which they can discover, engage and transact with local businesses to meet their everyday needs. Our value proposition to businesses is simple: we provide the opportunity to connect with the millions of purchase-intent driven consumers through our ad products; messaging features, such as Request-A-Quote; the Yelp Platform, our transaction platform; and retention tools, among other ways.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of advertising products. In the year ended December 31, 2017, our net revenue was $846.8 million, which represented an increase of 19% from the year ended December 31, 2016, and we recorded net income of $152.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of $156.6 million. In the year ended December 31, 2016, our net revenue was $713.1 million, which represented an increase of 30% from the year ended December 31, 2015, and we recorded a net loss of $4.7 million and adjusted EBITDA of $120.1 million.\nOur success is primarily the result of significant investment in our communities, employees, content, brand and technology. We believe that continued investment in our business provides our largest opportunity for future growth and plan to continue investing for long-term growth by focusing on the following priorities in 2018:\n \u2022 Driving Monetization. In 2017, the expansion of our self-serve sales channel and scaling of our customer success team led to improvements in our ability to attract and retain advertisers. In 2018, we plan to build on these efforts by offering our full-serve customers flexible advertising terms and customization options previously available only to self-serve customers. We believe this will result in a more efficient sales process and encourage businesses to try advertising on our platform. While this may result in higher turnover rates for new advertisers, we believe it will ultimately be outweighed by the resulting increase in customer satisfaction and our improved revenue retention abilities. \n \u2022 Generating Strong Usage and Engagement. Although we plan to continue investing in performance marketing in 2018, organic growth driven by our community development efforts continues to be the primary driver of our traffic. To that end, in 2018 we plan to expand our community management team to the neighborhood level by introducing Neighborhood \nAmbassadors to some of our most established markets, such as the Bay Area, New York and Boston. We also plan to continue our consumer protection efforts to safeguard the integrity of our reviews and our reputation.\n \u2022 Strengthening Our Competitive Position in the Restaurant Category. Our restaurants category receives the most traffic and reviews of any category on our platform. To strengthen our competitive advantage in this important area, we plan to invest in our Yelp Reservations and Yelp Nowait products by further integrating their functionality into our core user experience. We also expect to complete our integration of Grubhub's restaurant network by mid-2018, which will increase the number and quality of restaurants offering online ordering through the Yelp Platform. We anticipate that our investments in this area will result in increased sales and marketing and product development expenses in 2018, but believe that they are critical to our future success. \n \u2022 Building Out Our Home & Local Services Offering. In 2017, our Request-A-Quote feature helped drive growth in our largest category by revenue, Home & Local Service, both by facilitating connections between consumers and businesses and as an engine of financial growth through our existing cost-per-click ad model. In 2018, we plan to further refine the product through improvements to the process by which we match consumers initiating requests with businesses, among other things. We are also exploring new ways to monetize Request-A-Quote that better reflect the value of these high-converting leads.  We expect to continue to invest in capital expenditures in 2018 to support the growth of our business, primarily to increase our office space, upgrade our technology and infrastructure to improve the ability of our platform to handle the projected increase in usage, and enable the release of new features and solutions. As a result of this investment philosophy, we expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nTraffic and User Engagement. We derive substantially all of our revenue from advertising, and traffic to our platform determines the number of ads we are able to show, affects the value of those ads to businesses and influences the content creation that drives further traffic. As a result, our ability to grow our business depends on our ability to increase traffic on our platform, which in turn depends on, among other things, the quality of our content and the prominence of links to our platform in Internet search engine results and application marketplaces. The number of users we attract from search engines in particular can be affected by a number of factors not in our direct control; changes in a search engine's ranking algorithms, methodologies or design layouts may result in links to our website not being prominent enough to drive traffic to our website and mobile app.\nWe anticipate that our traffic growth will continue to slow over time, and potentially decrease in certain periods, as our business matures and we achieve higher penetration rates in our core markets of the United States and Canada. We also expect the cyclicality and seasonality in our business to become more pronounced as our business matures, including weaker traffic in the fourth quarter of the year. As our traffic growth rate slows, our success will become increasingly dependent on our ability to increase levels of user engagement on our platform, which itself depends on the quality of our content and our ability to introduce new and improved products that effectively address consumer needs, among other things.\nOur Ability to Attract and Retain Advertisers. Our revenue growth is driven by our ability to attract and retain advertising customers. To do so, we must deliver compelling ad products in an effective manner, at prices that compare favorably to those of our competitors. Our advertisers typically do not have long-term obligations to purchase our products, and an increasing portion have the ability to cancel their ad campaigns at any time. Their decisions to renew depend on the degree of satisfaction with our products as well as a number of factors that are outside of our control, including their ability to continue their operations and spending levels. The small and medium-sized businesses on which we heavily rely often have limited advertising budgets and may be disproportionately affected by economic downturns. As a result, a worsening economic outlook would likely cause businesses to decrease investments in advertising, which could adversely affect our revenue.\nOur ability to maintain and expand our advertiser base also depends on the size and productivity of our sales force and customer success team. As we continue to invest in expanding our sales organization, we must efficiently scale our operations while at the same time recruiting, training and integrating new hires and developing, motivating and retaining existing employees. Similarly, in order to retain, and take advantage of opportunities to deepen our relationships with, our existing customers, we must continue our efforts to build out our customer success team. Developing our account retention processes will be particularly important as an increasing portion of our advertisers have the ability to cancel their contracts at any time. In addition, as we make periodic adjustments to our sales organization to respond to market opportunities and to pursue initiatives to increase productivity, such changes may result in a temporary lack of focus or disruption to our operations. For example, it may take time for our sales and customer success organizations to adapt to selling and supporting advertising contracts with flexible cancellation terms.\nProduct Innovation. We must deliver innovative, relevant and useful products to consumers and businesses - including products for mobile and other alternative devices - to expand the size and engagement of our user base, attract advertisers and\nincrease our revenue. We plan to continue investing in new product development as we introduce new advertising and e-commerce products, explore new platforms and distribution channels, and develop partner arrangements that provide incremental value to our users and advertisers to encourage them to increase their usage of, and the portion of their advertising budgets allocated to, our platform. As our industry evolves and competition intensifies, our investments may increasingly include products and services outside of our historical core business, such as our planned investments in Yelp Reservations, Yelp Nowait and Yelp WiFi Marketing in 2018. These investments involve significant risks and uncertainties, such as distracting management, and may ultimately fail to generate sufficient revenue or other value to justify our investments in them.\nInvestment in Growth. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, aggressively to support the growth of our communities and platform. We dedicate significant resources to areas such as: marketing and community development; consumer protection; maintaining and enhancing the Yelp brand; and upgrading our systems, technology and network infrastructure to accommodate growth. Our investment plans for 2018 include the neighborhood-level expansion of our community management team and continuing our performance marketing program aimed at attracting more users and advertisers. We expect that these investments will increase our operating expenses, and that any increase in revenue resulting from product innovations will likely trail the increase in expenses.\nStock Repurchases. In July 2017, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $200 million of our outstanding common stock. We repurchased on the open market 302 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $12.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. We funded these repurchases, and expect to fund any future repurchases under the stock repurchase program, with cash available on our balance sheet. As a result, this program could diminish our cash reserves in addition to affecting the trading price and volatility of our stock.\nCorporate Development Activities. As part of our business strategy, we may decide to expand our product offerings and grow our business through the acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies. We may also sell existing business lines or technologies, as we did with our Yelp Eat24 business, which we sold to Grubhub in October 2017. In addition to diverting our management's attention and otherwise disrupting our operations, our corporate development activities will affect our future financial results due to factors such as expenses incurred in identifying, investigating and pursuing transactions, whether or not they are consummated, possible dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, unidentified liabilities and the amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the key metrics set forth below, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. Unless otherwise stated, these metrics do not include metrics for Yelp Eat24, Yelp Reservations, Yelp Nowait, Yelp WiFi Marketing or from our business owner products.\nReviews\nNumber of reviews represents the cumulative number of reviews submitted to Yelp since inception, as of the period end, including reviews that were not recommended or had been removed from our platform. In addition to the text of the review, each review includes a rating of one to five stars. We include reviews that are not recommended and that have been removed because all of them are either currently accessible on our platform or were accessible at some point in time, providing information that may be useful to users to evaluate businesses and individual reviewers. Because our automated recommendation software continually reassesses which reviews to recommend based on new information that becomes available, the recommended\u201d or not recommended\u201d status of reviews may change over time. Reviews that are not recommended or that have been removed do not factor into a business's overall star rating. By clicking on a link on a reviewed business's page on our website, users can access the reviews that are not currently recommended for the business, as well as the star rating and other information about reviews that were removed for violation of our terms of service.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately 137.7 million reviews were available on business listing pages, including approximately 31.7 million reviews that were not recommended, after 10.6 million reviews had been removed from our platform, either by us for violation of our terms of service or by the users who contributed them. The following table presents the number of cumulative reviews as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reviews\n</td> <td>148,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,210\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTraffic\nTraffic to our website and mobile app has three components: visitors to our non-mobile optimized website (our desktop website\u201d), visitors to our mobile-optimized website (our mobile website\u201d) and mobile devices accessing our mobile app. We use the following metrics to measure each of these traffic streams:\nDesktop and Mobile Website Unique Visitors. We calculate desktop unique visitors as the number of users,\u201d as measured by Google Analytics, who have visited our desktop website at least once in a given month, averaged over a given three-month period. Similarly, we calculate mobile website unique visitors as the number of users\u201d who have visited our mobile website at least once in a given month, averaged over a given three-month period.\nGoogle Analytics, a product from Google Inc. that provides digital marketing intelligence, measures users\u201d based on unique cookie identifiers. Because the numbers of desktop unique visitors and mobile website unique visitors are therefore based on unique cookies, an individual who accesses our desktop website or mobile website from multiple devices with different cookies may be counted as multiple desktop unique visitors or mobile website unique visitors, as applicable, and multiple individuals who access our desktop website or mobile website from a shared device with a single cookie may be counted as a single desktop unique visitor or mobile website unique visitor.\nApp Unique Devices. We calculate app unique devices as the number of unique mobile devices using our mobile app in a given month, averaged over a given three-month period. Under this method of calculation, an individual who accesses our mobile app from multiple mobile devices will be counted as multiple app unique devices. Multiple individuals who access our mobile app from a shared device will be counted as a single app unique device.\nWe anticipate that our mobile traffic will be the driver of our growth for the foreseeable future.\nThe following table presents our traffic for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Desktop Unique Visitors\n</td> <td>76,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,607\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mobile Web Unique Visitors\n</td> <td>64,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,860\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>App Unique Devices\n</td> <td>28,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,006\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs previously reported, a portion of our desktop traffic, as measured by Google Analytics, since the third quarter of 2016 has been attributable to a single robot. Because the traffic from this robot does not represent valid consumer traffic, we have adjusted the number of desktop unique visitors we are reporting above to remove such traffic to provide greater accuracy and transparency. For additional information, please see the risk factor included under Part I, Item 1A under the heading We rely on data from both internal tools and third parties to calculate certain of our performance metrics. Real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\u201d\nClaimed Local Business Locations\nThe number of claimed local business locations represents the cumulative number of business locations that have been claimed on Yelp worldwide since 2008, as of a given date. We define a claimed local business location as each business address for which a business representative has visited our website and claimed the free business listing page for the business located at that address. The following table presents the number of cumulative claimed local business locations as of the dates presented (in thousands):\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Claimed Local Business Locations\n</td> <td>4,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,648\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPaying Advertising Accounts\nPaying advertising accounts comprise all business accounts from which we recognized advertising revenue in a given three-month period. As with our advertising revenue classification, paying advertising accounts excludes subscription services customers that are not also advertising customers. The following table presents the number of paying advertising accounts during the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paying Advertising Accounts\n</td> <td>163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, we have also disclosed below EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We have included EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our primary business operations. Accordingly, we believe that EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In particular, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income should not be viewed as substitutes for, or superior to, net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income do not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n \u2022 EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income do not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; \n \u2022 EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income do not reflect the impact of the valuation allowance recording or release; \n \u2022 EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and \n \u2022 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.  Because of these limitations, you should consider EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income alongside other financial performance measures, including net income (loss), and our other GAAP results. The tables below present reconciliations of net income (loss) to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income , the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in each case, for each of the periods indicated.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: provision for (benefit from) income taxes; other (income) expense, net; and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $220.7 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: provision for (benefit from) income taxes; other income (expense), net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; gain on disposal of a business unit; and restructuring and integration costs. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $156.6 million.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,670\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32,900\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,068\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>31,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25,193\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>838\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>(4,864\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,694\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(386\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(221\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>407\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>41,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>220,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>100,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposal of a business unit\n</td> <td>(164,779\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and integration costs(1)\n</td> <td>288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Restructuring and integration includes $0.6 million in stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2013. \nNon-GAAP Net Income\nNon-GAAP net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as GAAP net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: stock-based compensation expense; amortization of intangibles; the tax effect of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, restructuring and integration costs, gain on disposal of a business unit and valuation allowance; and certain other non-recurring items, such as restructuring and integration costs accounted for in 2016 and 2017, and gain on disposal of a business unit accounted for in 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $80.2 million and $59.4 million, respectively.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, website and internal-use software development costs, business combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes and stock-based compensation expense have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on these and our other significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(as a percentage of net revenue)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue by product:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transactions\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other services\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brand advertising\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net revenue\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below)\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product development\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and integration cost\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposal of a business unit\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYears Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nNet Revenue\nWe generate revenue from our advertising products, transactions, other services and, through the end of 2015, brand advertising.\nAdvertising. We generate advertising revenue from our advertising programs, which consist of enhanced listing pages and performance and impression-based advertising in search results and elsewhere on our website and mobile app. Advertising revenue also includes revenue generated from resale of our advertising products by certain partners and monetization of remnant advertising inventory through third-party ad networks. We expect our advertising revenue to continue to increase, as our sales force focuses on both increasing the number of paying advertising accounts and grow revenue generated from existing advertisers.\nTransactions. We generate revenue from various transactions with consumers, including transactions placed through our partner integrations, the sale of Yelp Deals and Gift Certificates and, through October 10, 2017, Yelp Eat24 transactions. Following our sale of Eat24 to Grubhub on October 10, 2017, we generate revenue from transactions placed through the Grubhub restaurant network, including Eat24 restaurants, that originate on Yelp pursuant to our partnership agreement with Grubhub.\nOur partnership integrations are revenue-sharing arrangements that provide consumers with the ability to complete food ordering and delivery transactions, order flowers and book spa and salon appointments, among others, through third parties directly on Yelp. We earn a fee for acting as an agent for transactions placed through these integrations, which we record on a net basis and include in revenue upon completion of a transaction.\nPrior to the completion of our sale of Eat24, we generated revenue from our Yelp Eat24 business through arrangements with restaurants in which restaurants pay a commission percentage fee on orders placed through the Yelp Eat24 platform, which we recorded on a net basis. Following the completion of the sale, we no longer recognize revenue from Yelp Eat24 as a standalone product. Instead, under our partnership agreement with Grubhub, we earn fees on food orders placed through the Grubhub restaurant network, including Eat24 restaurants, that originate on the Yelp Platform. We expect the revenue generated under the Grubhub arrangement to continue to be lower than the revenue previously generated by Yelp Eat24 for the foreseeable future, particularly before the remainder of the Grubhub restaurant network is fully integrated onto our platform, which is currently targeted to occur by mid-2018. Accordingly, our sale of Eat24 has resulted in a reduction in our transactions revenue and slowing of our total net revenue growth following the sale.\nYelp Deals allow merchants to promote themselves and offer discounted goods and services on a real-time basis to consumers directly on our website and mobile app. We earn a fee on Yelp Deals for acting as an agent in these transactions, which we record on a net basis and recognize as revenue upon a consumer's purchase of a deal. Gift Certificates allow merchants to sell full-priced gift certificates directly to consumers through their business listing pages. We earn a fee based on the amount of the Gift Certificate sold, which we record on a net basis and recognize as revenue upon a consumer's purchase of the Gift Certificate.\nOther Services. We generate revenue through our Yelp Reservations and Yelp Nowait products, the Yelp WiFi Marketing analytics platform, licensing payments for access to Yelp data through our Yelp Knowledge program and other non-advertising related partnerships.\nBrand Advertising. Through the end of 2015, we generated revenue from brand advertising through the sale of display advertisements and brand sponsorships to national brands. We phased out these products to focus on our core strength of local advertising.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of our net revenue for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to\n2017 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to\n2016 %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue by product:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>771,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>645,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>471,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transactions\n</td> <td>60,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other services\n</td> <td>14,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brand advertising\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>846,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>713,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>549,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of total net revenue by product:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transactions\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other services\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brand advertising\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net revenue\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2017, 2016 and 2015, we focused on revenue growth related to our local advertiser customer base. Total net revenue increased $133.7 million, or 19%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $163.4 million, or 30%, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nAdvertising revenue increased $126.4 million, or 20%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $173.8 million, or 37%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in both periods was primarily due to a significant increase in the number of customers purchasing advertising plans as we expanded our sales force to reach more businesses. The growth in both periods was driven primarily by purchases of cost-per-click advertising. In each of 2017, 2016 and 2015, a majority of ad clicks were delivered on mobile.\nOur transactions revenue decreased $2.2 million, or 4%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $18.6 million, or 43%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in 2017 was a result of our sale of Eat24 to Grubhub in October 2017, as we no longer recognized revenue from transactions from Yelp Eat24. The increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily the result of increased transactions from Yelp Eat24, which was acquired in February 2015.\nOur other services revenue increased $9.6 million, or 180%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $1.9 million, or 56%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to the acquisitions of Nowait and Turnstyle as well as increased revenue from Yelp Reservations. The increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases in revenue from Yelp Reservations.\nAs of the beginning of 2016, we no longer offer brand advertising products. As a result, we generated no brand advertising revenue in 2017 or 2016.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of credit card processing fees, web hosting costs and employee costs (including stock-based compensation expense) for our infrastructure teams related to the operation of our website and mobile app. It also includes confirmation services costs associated with Yelp Reservations, Yelp Nowait and Yelp WiFi Marketing, confirmation and delivery services associated with Yelp Eat24 prior to its sale, as well as video production costs for our advertising customers. Following our sale of Eat24 in October 2017, there was an initial reduction in our cost of revenue associated with credit card transactions,\nas well as confirmation and delivery services. We expect cost of revenue associated with our advertising customers to increase in 2018 as we increase the number of customers, offset by a reduction in cost of revenue associated with our transactions business as a result of our disposal of Eat24.\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to\n2017 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to\n2016 %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net revenue\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue increased $10.2 million, or 17%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $9.3 million, or 18%, in 2016 compared to 2015. Website infrastructure expense increased $5.4 million and $1.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, which primarily consists of website hosting and employee-related costs associated with employees supporting the hosting of the website. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in the number of visitors to, and increased transactions completed on, our website compared to the prior year, as well as increased headcount for personnel supporting the website infrastructure. The increase in website infrastructure expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was comparatively less than that of 2017 compared to 2016 due to reduced server hosting costs achieved from improved pricing from key website hosting vendors.\nCost of revenue also increased by $3.1 million and $0.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, compared to the prior year periods, as a result of increases in confirmation services and third-party food delivery costs. The increase in 2017 was due to an increase in the number of Yelp Eat24 transactions, and increased confirmation services expenses associated with Yelp Reservations, as well as Yelp Nowait and Yelp WiFi Marketing following our acquisitions of Nowait and Turnstyle. Additionally, cost of revenue increased in 2017 and 2016 as a result of increases of $2.4 million and $6.9 million, respectively, in merchant fees related to credit card transactions due to growth in advertising and transactions revenue. The rate of increase in these costs in 2017 was lower than the increase in 2016 as a result of the sale of Yelp Eat24 in 2017, and the slower growth rate in advertising revenue that year. In 2017, set up and creative design costs decreased by $0.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in video production costs. In 2016, set up and creative design costs increased by $1.2 million due to greater demand by businesses for video on their business listing pages.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee costs (including incentive compensation expense and stock-based compensation expense) for our sales and marketing employees. In addition, sales and marketing expenses include business and consumer acquisition marketing, community management, branding and advertising costs, as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs.\nFollowing our disposal of Eat24 to Grubhub in October 2017, we ceased marketing activities related to Yelp Eat24 and over 300 Yelp Eat24 sales and marketing employees transferred to Grubhub. While we have redeployed the remaining sales employees and resources previously associated with Eat24 within our organization, the Eat24 sale resulted in an initial reduction in our sales and marketing expenses. However, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we expand our communities, increase the number of advertising and subscription accounts and continue to build the Yelp brand in the United States and Canada. We expect the majority of sales and marketing expense increases for the foreseeable future to be related to hiring sales employees, as well as to costs incurred with various third-party media outlets and other advertising channels.\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to\n2017 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to\n2016 %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>438,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>382,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net revenue\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expenses increased $55.8 million, or 15%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $81.1 million, or 27%, in 2016 compared 2015. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily attributable to $42.8 million and $48.5 million, respectively, in additional salaries benefits, travel and other related expenses resulting from increases in headcount, including increases in stock-based compensation expense of $1.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively, as we expanded our sales organization to increase the number of paying advertising accounts and grow revenue from existing customers in the United States and Canada. We also experienced increases in facilities and other overhead allocations of $6.1 million and $10.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as we leased additional office space and incurred additional costs for our expanding headcount. As a result of our increases in net\nrevenue, our commission expenses increased by $4.6 million and $7.8 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, as a result of ongoing business and consumer marketing campaigns, marketing and advertising costs increased by $2.3 million and $14.8 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nProduct Development\nOur product development expenses primarily consist of employee costs (including stock-based compensation expense) for our engineers, product management and information technology personnel. In addition, product development expenses include outside services and consulting costs, as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We believe that continued investment in features, software development tools and code modification is important to attaining our strategic objectives and, as a result, we expect product development expenses to continue to increase for the foreseeable future. Although our sale of Eat24 will reduce our product development expenses associated with the Yelp Eat24 product, we have redeployed the associated internal resources elsewhere within our organization and do not expect the sale to have a material impact on our overall product development expenses as a result.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to\n2017 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to\n2016 %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net revenue\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct development expenses increased $37.2 million, or 27%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $30.8 million, or 29%, in 2016 compared to 2015.

In addition, we experienced increases in facilities and other overhead allocations of $6.0 million and $5.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as we leased additional office space and incurred additional costs for our expanding headcount.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee costs (including stock-based compensation expense) for our executive, finance, user operations, legal, human resources and other administrative employees. Our general and administrative expenses also include bad debt expenses, outside consulting, legal and accounting services, as well as facilities other supporting overhead costs. We expect bad debt expenses to increase as our advertising revenue continues to grow, and our other general and administrative costs should also increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our business. We do not expect our disposal of Eat24 to have a material impact on our general and administrative costs.\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to\n2017 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to\n2016 %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net revenue\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $8.2 million, or 8%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $16.6 million, or 21%, in 2016 compared to 2015.

In 2017, the increase was also driven by an increase in one-time bonuses incurred in the year. Bad debt expense increased by $1.0 million in 2017 and $5.6 million in 2016 due to continued growth in advertising revenue. The rate of increase in bad debt expense in 2017 was less than that of 2016 as a result of improved collections rates from advertising customers.\nIn 2017, the use of outside consultants increased by $1.4 million as we invested in our systems and support for the growth of the business. In 2016, there was a decrease in consulting costs of $2.6 million due to decreased reliance on outside consultants. Facilities and other related allocations in 2017 were consistent with those in the prior year. We experienced an increase in facilities and other overhead allocations of $1.5 million in 2016, as a result of the increase in headcount.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on computer equipment, software, leasehold improvements, capitalized website and software development costs and amortization of purchased intangible assets. We expect depreciation expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our technology infrastructure, and lease additional office space. Amortization expense is likely to be lower for the foreseeable future as a result of the disposition of intangible assets in our sale of Eat24 to Grubhub in October 2017.\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to\n2017 %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to\n2016 %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net revenue\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $5.9 million, or 17%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $5.7 million, or 19%, in 2016 compared to 2015.

Income tax expense increased $30.1 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the gain on disposal of a business unit. Income tax expense decreased $10.6 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the valuation allowance recorded in 2015 against certain deferred tax assets.\nIt is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months there may be sufficient positive evidence to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance. Release of this valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the net income that we are able to actually achieve. We will continue to evaluate the possible release of valuation allowance on a quarterly basis.\nQuarterly Results of Operations and Other Data\nThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2017 (in thousands, except per share data). We also present other financial and operational data and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. We have prepared this quarterly data on a consistent basis with the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. In the opinion of management, the quarterly financial information reflects all necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of this data. This information should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period.\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

<td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $547.9 million. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, money market funds and investments with original maturities of less than three months. Our cash held internationally as of December 31, 2017 was $6.4 million. We did not have any outstanding bank loans or credit facilities in place as of December 31, 2017. Our investment portfolio comprises highly rated marketable securities, and our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires securities to be investment grade (i.e. rated \u2018A' or higher by bond rating firms) with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. To date, we have been able to finance our operations and our acquisitions through proceeds from private and public financings, including our initial public offering in March 2012, our follow-on offering in October 2013, cash generated from operations and, to a lesser extent, cash provided by the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended ( ESPP\u201d). In addition, on October 10, 2017, we completed our sale of Eat24 to Grubhub and received $252.7 million in cash, with an additional $28.8 million that is currently being held in escrow for an 18-month period after closing to secure our indemnification obligations in connection with the sale.\nOur future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with any cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and anticipated purchases of property and equipment for at least the next 12 months. However, this estimate is based on a number of assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could exhaust our available cash and cash equivalents earlier than presently anticipated. We may require or otherwise seek additional funds in the next 12 months to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features and products or enhance existing services, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies, and, accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds.\nAmounts deposited with third-party financial institutions exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance limits, as applicable. These cash and cash equivalents could be impacted if the underlying\nfinancial institutions fail or are subjected to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>167,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>79,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55,572\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(158,682\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>27,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities. We generated $167.6 million of cash in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily resulting from our net income of $152.9 million, which included the gain on disposal of Eat24 of $164.8 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses of $41.2 million, non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $100.4 million, and non-cash provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $18.4 million. In addition, significant changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted from the following:\n \u2022 increase in accounts receivable of $32.1 million due to an increase in billings for advertising plans, particularly those customers billed in-arrears, as well as the timing of payments from these customers; \n \u2022 increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $52.9 million, primarily driven by an increase in income taxes payable associated with the gain on disposal of Eat24, accrued bonus and commissions, and various other accrued operating costs and expenses as a result of the growth in our business, offset by a decrease in restaurant revenue share liability as a result of the disposal of Eat24; and \n \u2022 increase in prepaids and other assets of $1.4 million, primarily due to an increase in tenant improvement allowance receivable and prepaid licenses.  We generated $126.9 million of cash in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily resulting from our net loss of $4.7 million, which included non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses of $35.3 million, non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $86.3 million and non-cash provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $17.3 million. In addition, significant changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted from the following:\n \u2022 increase in accounts receivable of $31.6 million due to an increase in billings for advertising plans, as well as the timing of payments from these customers; \n \u2022 increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $15.3 million, primarily driven by an increase in restaurant revenue share liability, accrued vacation and employee-related expenses, and the timing of invoices and payments to the vendors, particularly marketing-related vendors; and \n \u2022 decrease in prepaids and other assets of $5.7 million, primarily due to the collection of non-trade receivables.  We generated $57.4 million of cash in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily resulting from our net loss of $32.9 million, which included non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses of $29.6 million, non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $60.8 million, non-cash provision for doubtful accounts of $16.8 million and a $20.3 million expense related to a valuation allowance recorded against certain domestic and foreign deferred tax assets. In addition, significant changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted from the following:\n \u2022 increase in accounts receivable of $25.3 million due to an increase in billings for advertising plans, as well as the timing of payments from these customers; \n \u2022 increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $15.9 million related to the growth in our business, increase in restaurant revenue share liability, accrued vacation and employee-related expenses, and the timing of invoices and payments to vendors; and \n \u2022 increase in prepaids and other assets of $22.7 million relating to an increase in prepayments (primarily for marketing and business licenses) and deferred tax benefits. \nInvesting Activities. Our primary investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of purchases of marketable securities, acquisitions of businesses, the sale of a business unit, purchases of property and equipment to support the ongoing build out of leasehold improvements for our new facilities in San Francisco, Washington D.C. and other locations, the purchase of technology hardware to support our growth in headcount and internally developed software to support website and mobile app development, website operations and our corporate infrastructure. Purchases of property, equipment and software may vary from period to period due to the timing of the expansion of our offices, operations and website and internal-use software and development. We expect our investment in property and equipment, leasehold assets and the development of software in 2018 to grow from 2017 levels.\nWe generated $79.9 million of cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash provided by investing activities primarily related to $252.7 million net cash received for the sale of Eat24 to Grubhub on October 10, 2017 and $264.0 million of maturities of investment securities held-to-maturity. Cash provided by investing was offset by purchases of marketable securities of $354.9 million, purchases of property, equipment and software of $15.6 million to support the growth in our business, expenditures related to website and internally developed software of $14.6 million, as well as our acquisition of Nowait for net cash consideration of $30.8 million, which included intangible assets of $12.7 million, and our acquisition of Turnstyle for net cash consideration of $19.7 million, which included intangible assets of $4.3 million.\nWe used $55.6 million of cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash used in investing activities primarily related to purchases of marketable securities of $275.0 million, expenditures related to website and internally developed software of $14.2 million, purchases of property, equipment and software of $23.0 million to support the growth in our business, our investment of $8.0 million in the preferred stock of Nowait and purchases of intangible data licenses of $0.2 million. In addition, as part of our lease agreements for additional office space, we were obligated to deliver additional letters of credit, which resulted in an increase of $0.8 million in restricted cash. Cash used in investing was offset by $265.5 million of maturities of investment securities held-to-maturity.\nWe used $158.7 million of cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash used in investing activities primarily related to the $73.4 million cash portion of the purchase price of Eat24, purchases of marketable securities of $246.2 million, expenditures related to website and internally developed software of $11.7 million, purchases of intangible data licenses of $0.6 million and purchases of property, equipment, software and leasehold improvements of $31.1 million to support the growth in our business. Cash used in investing was offset by $202.9 million of maturities of investment securities held-to-maturity and the release of restrictions on cash of $1.4 million.\nFinancing Activities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $27.2 million in financing activities, primarily due to net proceeds of $30.0 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and $10.9 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock under the ESPP. Cash provided by financing activities was offset by $12.6 million in repurchases of common stock and $1.2 million of taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards for our international employees.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated $29.5 million in financing activities, primarily due to net proceeds of $20.6 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and $8.9 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock under the ESPP.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated $26.4 million in financing activities, primarily due to net proceeds of $12.3 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options, $8.9 million in net proceeds from the sale of stock under our ESPP and $6.6 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based award activity.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn July 2017, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $200 million of our outstanding common stock. We may purchase shares at our discretion in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, in transactions structured through investment banking institutions, or a combination of the foregoing. The program is not subject to any time limit and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. The amount and timing of repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including liquidity, cash flow and market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased 302,206 shares on the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $12.6 million and had retired 301,106 of these shares as of December 31, 2017; the remaining treasury shares were subsequently retired in 2018. We funded these repurchases, and expect to fund any future repurchases under the stock repurchase program, with cash available on our balance sheet, which will continue to increase the cash used in investing activities.\nNet Share Settlement of Equity Awards\nIn 2017, we began settling the employee tax liabilities associated with the vesting of RSUs through net share withholding - rather than selling a portion of the vested shares to cover taxes, as we had previously - for international employees. As a result, we paid $1.2 million of employee taxes out of cash held on our consolidated balance sheet. Although we continued to sell a portion of vested shares to cover such taxes for U.S.-based employees in 2017, we intend to begin net share withholding for them as well in 2018, which will result in an increase in cash used in financing activities in 2018.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 303(a)(4)(ii) promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act, in 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nContractual Obligations\nWe lease various office facilities, including our corporate headquarters in San Francisco, California, under operating lease agreements that expire from 2018 to 2029. The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease periods. We do not have any debt or material capital lease obligations, and all of our property, equipment and software have been purchased with cash. As of December 31, 2017, we had no material long-term purchase obligations outstanding with vendors or third parties other than obligations related to the fit out of certain leasehold properties. As of December 31, 2017, the following table summarizes our future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases and purchase obligations for equipment and office facilities (in thousands):\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>332,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with binding agreements and do not include obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, our total liability for uncertain tax positions was $3.4 million of the total unrecognized benefit of $18.2 million. We are not reasonably able to estimate the timing of future cash flow related to this liability. As a result, this amount is not included in the contractual obligations table above.\nWe have subleased certain office facilities under operating lease agreements that expire in 2021. The terms of these lease agreements provide for rental receipts on a graduated basis. We recognize sublease rentals on a straight-line basis over the lease periods reflected as a reduction in rental expense. As of December 31, 2017, our future minimum rental receipts to be received under non-cancelable subleases were $6.5 million.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included under Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nAs the leading local business review site in the United States, we offer consumers unmatched local business information, as well as a convenient platform on which they can discover, engage and transact with local businesses to meet their everyday needs. Our value proposition to businesses is simple: we provide the opportunity to connect with the millions of purchase-intent driven consumers through our ad products; messaging features, such as Request-A-Quote; the Yelp Platform, our transaction platform; and retention tools, among other ways.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of advertising products. In the year ended December 31, 2017, our net revenue was $846.8 million, which represented an increase of 19% from the year ended December 31, 2016, and we recorded net income of $152.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of $156.6 million. In the year ended December 31, 2016, our net revenue was $713.1 million, which represented an increase of 30% from the year ended December 31, 2015, and we recorded a net loss of $4.7 million and adjusted EBITDA of $120.1 million.\nOur success is primarily the result of significant investment in our communities, employees, content, brand and technology. We believe that continued investment in our business provides our largest opportunity for future growth and plan to continue investing for long-term growth by focusing on the following priorities in 2018:\n \u2022 Driving Monetization. In 2017, the expansion of our self-serve sales channel and scaling of our customer success team led to improvements in our ability to attract and retain advertisers. In 2018, we plan to build on these efforts by offering our full-serve customers flexible advertising terms and customization options previously available only to self-serve customers. We believe this will result in a more efficient sales process and encourage businesses to try advertising on our platform. While this may result in higher turnover rates for new advertisers, we believe it will ultimately be outweighed by the resulting increase in customer satisfaction and our improved revenue retention abilities. \n \u2022 Generating Strong Usage and Engagement. Although we plan to continue investing in performance marketing in 2018, organic growth driven by our community development efforts continues to be the primary driver of our traffic. To that end, in 2018 we plan to expand our community management team to the neighborhood level by introducing Neighborhood \nAmbassadors to some of our most established markets, such as the Bay Area, New York and Boston. We also plan to continue our consumer protection efforts to safeguard the integrity of our reviews and our reputation.\n \u2022 Strengthening Our Competitive Position in the Restaurant Category. Our restaurants category receives the most traffic and reviews of any category on our platform. To strengthen our competitive advantage in this important area, we plan to invest in our Yelp Reservations and Yelp Nowait products by further integrating their functionality into our core user experience. We also expect to complete our integration of Grubhub's restaurant network by mid-2018, which will increase the number and quality of restaurants offering online ordering through the Yelp Platform. We anticipate that our investments in this area will result in increased sales and marketing and product development expenses in 2018, but believe that they are critical to our future success. \n \u2022 Building Out Our Home & Local Services Offering. In 2017, our Request-A-Quote feature helped drive growth in our largest category by revenue, Home & Local Service, both by facilitating connections between consumers and businesses and as an engine of financial growth through our existing cost-per-click ad model. In 2018, we plan to further refine the product through improvements to the process by which we match consumers initiating requests with businesses, among other things. We are also exploring new ways to monetize Request-A-Quote that better reflect the value of these high-converting leads.  We expect to continue to invest in capital expenditures in 2018 to support the growth of our business, primarily to increase our office space, upgrade our technology and infrastructure to improve the ability of our platform to handle the projected increase in usage, and enable the release of new features and solutions. As a result of this investment philosophy, we expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nTraffic and User Engagement. We derive substantially all of our revenue from advertising, and traffic to our platform determines the number of ads we are able to show, affects the value of those ads to businesses and influences the content creation that drives further traffic. As a result, our ability to grow our business depends on our ability to increase traffic on our platform, which in turn depends on, among other things, the quality of our content and the prominence of links to our platform in Internet search engine results and application marketplaces. The number of users we attract from search engines in particular can be affected by a number of factors not in our direct control; changes in a search engine's ranking algorithms, methodologies or design layouts may result in links to our website not being prominent enough to drive traffic to our website and mobile app.\nWe anticipate that our traffic growth will continue to slow over time, and potentially decrease in certain periods, as our business matures and we achieve higher penetration rates in our core markets of the United States and Canada. We also expect the cyclicality and seasonality in our business to become more pronounced as our business matures, including weaker traffic in the fourth quarter of the year. As our traffic growth rate slows, our success will become increasingly dependent on our ability to increase levels of user engagement on our platform, which itself depends on the quality of our content and our ability to introduce new and improved products that effectively address consumer needs, among other things.\nOur Ability to Attract and Retain Advertisers. Our revenue growth is driven by our ability to attract and retain advertising customers. To do so, we must deliver compelling ad products in an effective manner, at prices that compare favorably to those of our competitors. Our advertisers typically do not have long-term obligations to purchase our products, and an increasing portion have the ability to cancel their ad campaigns at any time. Their decisions to renew depend on the degree of satisfaction with our products as well as a number of factors that are outside of our control, including their ability to continue their operations and spending levels. The small and medium-sized businesses on which we heavily rely often have limited advertising budgets and may be disproportionately affected by economic downturns. As a result, a worsening economic outlook would likely cause businesses to decrease investments in advertising, which could adversely affect our revenue.\nOur ability to maintain and expand our advertiser base also depends on the size and productivity of our sales force and customer success team. As we continue to invest in expanding our sales organization, we must efficiently scale our operations while at the same time recruiting, training and integrating new hires and developing, motivating and retaining existing employees. Similarly, in order to retain, and take advantage of opportunities to deepen our relationships with, our existing customers, we must continue our efforts to build out our customer success team. Developing our account retention processes will be particularly important as an increasing portion of our advertisers have the ability to cancel their contracts at any time. In addition, as we make periodic adjustments to our sales organization to respond to market opportunities and to pursue initiatives to increase productivity, such changes may result in a temporary lack of focus or disruption to our operations. For example, it may take time for our sales and customer success organizations to adapt to selling and supporting advertising contracts with flexible cancellation terms.\nProduct Innovation. We must deliver innovative, relevant and useful products to consumers and businesses - including products for mobile and other alternative devices - to expand the size and engagement of our user base, attract advertisers and\nincrease our revenue. We plan to continue investing in new product development as we introduce new advertising and e-commerce products, explore new platforms and distribution channels, and develop partner arrangements that provide incremental value to our users and advertisers to encourage them to increase their usage of, and the portion of their advertising budgets allocated to, our platform. As our industry evolves and competition intensifies, our investments may increasingly include products and services outside of our historical core business, such as our planned investments in Yelp Reservations, Yelp Nowait and Yelp WiFi Marketing in 2018. These investments involve significant risks and uncertainties, such as distracting management, and may ultimately fail to generate sufficient revenue or other value to justify our investments in them.\nInvestment in Growth. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, aggressively to support the growth of our communities and platform. We dedicate significant resources to areas such as: marketing and community development; consumer protection; maintaining and enhancing the Yelp brand; and upgrading our systems, technology and network infrastructure to accommodate growth. Our investment plans for 2018 include the neighborhood-level expansion of our community management team and continuing our performance marketing program aimed at attracting more users and advertisers. We expect that these investments will increase our operating expenses, and that any increase in revenue resulting from product innovations will likely trail the increase in expenses.\nStock Repurchases. In July 2017, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $200 million of our outstanding common stock. We repurchased on the open market 302 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $12.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. We funded these repurchases, and expect to fund any future repurchases under the stock repurchase program, with cash available on our balance sheet. As a result, this program could diminish our cash reserves in addition to affecting the trading price and volatility of our stock.\nCorporate Development Activities. As part of our business strategy, we may decide to expand our product offerings and grow our business through the acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies. We may also sell existing business lines or technologies, as we did with our Yelp Eat24 business, which we sold to Grubhub in October 2017. In addition to diverting our management's attention and otherwise disrupting our operations, our corporate development activities will affect our future financial results due to factors such as expenses incurred in identifying, investigating and pursuing transactions, whether or not they are consummated, possible dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, unidentified liabilities and the amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the key metrics set forth below, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. Unless otherwise stated, these metrics do not include metrics for Yelp Eat24, Yelp Reservations, Yelp Nowait, Yelp WiFi Marketing or from our business owner products.\nReviews\nNumber of reviews represents the cumulative number of reviews submitted to Yelp since inception, as of the period end, including reviews that were not recommended or had been removed from our platform. In addition to the text of the review, each review includes a rating of one to five stars. We include reviews that are not recommended and that have been removed because all of them are either currently accessible on our platform or were accessible at some point in time, providing information that may be useful to users to evaluate businesses and individual reviewers. Because our automated recommendation software continually reassesses which reviews to recommend based on new information that becomes available, the recommended\u201d or not recommended\u201d status of reviews may change over time. Reviews that are not recommended or that have been removed do not factor into a business's overall star rating. By clicking on a link on a reviewed business's page on our website, users can access the reviews that are not currently recommended for the business, as well as the star rating and other information about reviews that were removed for violation of our terms of service.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately 137.7 million reviews were available on business listing pages, including approximately 31.7 million reviews that were not recommended, after 10.6 million reviews had been removed from our platform, either by us for violation of our terms of service or by the users who contributed them. The following table presents the number of cumulative reviews as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\n\nTraffic\nTraffic to our website and mobile app has three components: visitors to our non-mobile optimized website (our desktop website\u201d), visitors to our mobile-optimized website (our mobile website\u201d) and mobile devices accessing our mobile app. We use the following metrics to measure each of these traffic streams:\nDesktop and Mobile Website Unique Visitors. We calculate desktop unique visitors as the number of users,\u201d as measured by Google Analytics, who have visited our desktop website at least once in a given month, averaged over a given three-month period. Similarly, we calculate mobile website unique visitors as the number of users\u201d who have visited our mobile website at least once in a given month, averaged over a given three-month period.\nGoogle Analytics, a product from Google Inc. that provides digital marketing intelligence, measures users\u201d based on unique cookie identifiers. Because the numbers of desktop unique visitors and mobile website unique visitors are therefore based on unique cookies, an individual who accesses our desktop website or mobile website from multiple devices with different cookies may be counted as multiple desktop unique visitors or mobile website unique visitors, as applicable, and multiple individuals who access our desktop website or mobile website from a shared device with a single cookie may be counted as a single desktop unique visitor or mobile website unique visitor.\nApp Unique Devices. We calculate app unique devices as the number of unique mobile devices using our mobile app in a given month, averaged over a given three-month period. Under this method of calculation, an individual who accesses our mobile app from multiple mobile devices will be counted as multiple app unique devices. Multiple individuals who access our mobile app from a shared device will be counted as a single app unique device.\nWe anticipate that our mobile traffic will be the driver of our growth for the foreseeable future.\nThe following table presents our traffic for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nAs previously reported, a portion of our desktop traffic, as measured by Google Analytics, since the third quarter of 2016 has been attributable to a single robot. Because the traffic from this robot does not represent valid consumer traffic, we have adjusted the number of desktop unique visitors we are reporting above to remove such traffic to provide greater accuracy and transparency. For additional information, please see the risk factor included under Part I, Item 1A under the heading We rely on data from both internal tools and third parties to calculate certain of our performance metrics. Real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\u201d\nClaimed Local Business Locations\nThe number of claimed local business locations represents the cumulative number of business locations that have been claimed on Yelp worldwide since 2008, as of a given date. We define a claimed local business location as each business address for which a business representative has visited our website and claimed the free business listing page for the business located at that address. The following table presents the number of cumulative claimed local business locations as of the dates presented (in thousands):\n\nPaying Advertising Accounts\nPaying advertising accounts comprise all business accounts from which we recognized advertising revenue in a given three-month period. As with our advertising revenue classification, paying advertising accounts excludes subscription services customers that are not also advertising customers. The following table presents the number of paying advertising accounts during the periods presented (in thousands):\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, we have also disclosed below EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We have included EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our primary business operations. Accordingly, we believe that EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In particular, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income should not be viewed as substitutes for, or superior to, net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income do not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n \u2022 EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income do not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; \n \u2022 EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income do not reflect the impact of the valuation allowance recording or release; \n \u2022 EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and \n \u2022 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.  Because of these limitations, you should consider EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income alongside other financial performance measures, including net income (loss), and our other GAAP results. The tables below present reconciliations of net income (loss) to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income , the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in each case, for each of the periods indicated.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: provision for (benefit from) income taxes; other (income) expense, net; and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $220.7 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: provision for (benefit from) income taxes; other income (expense), net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; gain on disposal of a business unit; and restructuring and integration costs. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $156.6 million.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\n\n (1) Restructuring and integration includes $0.6 million in stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2013. \nNon-GAAP Net Income\nNon-GAAP net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as GAAP net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: stock-based compensation expense; amortization of intangibles; the tax effect of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, restructuring and integration costs, gain on disposal of a business unit and valuation allowance; and certain other non-recurring items, such as restructuring and integration costs accounted for in 2016 and 2017, and gain on disposal of a business unit accounted for in 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $80.2 million and $59.4 million, respectively. The following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Non-GAAP net income (in thousands):\n\n (1) Includes tax effects of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, restructuring and integration costs, gain on disposal of a business unit and valuation allowance. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, website and internal-use software development costs, business combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes and stock-based compensation expense have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on these and our other significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nNet Revenue\nWe generate revenue from our advertising products, transactions, other services and, through the end of 2015, brand advertising.\nAdvertising. We generate advertising revenue from our advertising programs, which consist of enhanced listing pages and performance and impression-based advertising in search results and elsewhere on our website and mobile app. Advertising revenue also includes revenue generated from resale of our advertising products by certain partners and monetization of remnant advertising inventory through third-party ad networks. We expect our advertising revenue to continue to increase, as our sales force focuses on both increasing the number of paying advertising accounts and grow revenue generated from existing advertisers.\nTransactions. We generate revenue from various transactions with consumers, including transactions placed through our partner integrations, the sale of Yelp Deals and Gift Certificates and, through October 10, 2017, Yelp Eat24 transactions. Following our sale of Eat24 to Grubhub on October 10, 2017, we generate revenue from transactions placed through the Grubhub restaurant network, including Eat24 restaurants, that originate on Yelp pursuant to our partnership agreement with Grubhub.\nOur partnership integrations are revenue-sharing arrangements that provide consumers with the ability to complete food ordering and delivery transactions, order flowers and book spa and salon appointments, among others, through third parties directly on Yelp. We earn a fee for acting as an agent for transactions placed through these integrations, which we record on a net basis and include in revenue upon completion of a transaction.\nPrior to the completion of our sale of Eat24, we generated revenue from our Yelp Eat24 business through arrangements with restaurants in which restaurants pay a commission percentage fee on orders placed through the Yelp Eat24 platform, which we recorded on a net basis. Following the completion of the sale, we no longer recognize revenue from Yelp Eat24 as a standalone product. Instead, under our partnership agreement with Grubhub, we earn fees on food orders placed through the Grubhub restaurant network, including Eat24 restaurants, that originate on the Yelp Platform. We expect the revenue generated under the Grubhub arrangement to continue to be lower than the revenue previously generated by Yelp Eat24 for the foreseeable future, particularly before the remainder of the Grubhub restaurant network is fully integrated onto our platform, which is currently targeted to occur by mid-2018. Accordingly, our sale of Eat24 has resulted in a reduction in our transactions revenue and slowing of our total net revenue growth following the sale.\nYelp Deals allow merchants to promote themselves and offer discounted goods and services on a real-time basis to consumers directly on our website and mobile app. We earn a fee on Yelp Deals for acting as an agent in these transactions, which we record on a net basis and recognize as revenue upon a consumer's purchase of a deal. Gift Certificates allow merchants to sell full-priced gift certificates directly to consumers through their business listing pages. We earn a fee based on the amount of the Gift Certificate sold, which we record on a net basis and recognize as revenue upon a consumer's purchase of the Gift Certificate.\nOther Services. We generate revenue through our Yelp Reservations and Yelp Nowait products, the Yelp WiFi Marketing analytics platform, licensing payments for access to Yelp data through our Yelp Knowledge program and other non-advertising related partnerships.\nBrand Advertising. Through the end of 2015, we generated revenue from brand advertising through the sale of display advertisements and brand sponsorships to national brands. We phased out these products to focus on our core strength of local advertising.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of our net revenue for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\n\nDuring 2017, 2016 and 2015, we focused on revenue growth related to our local advertiser customer base. Total net revenue increased $133.7 million, or 19%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $163.4 million, or 30%, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nAdvertising revenue increased $126.4 million, or 20%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $173.8 million, or 37%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in both periods was primarily due to a significant increase in the number of customers purchasing advertising plans as we expanded our sales force to reach more businesses. The growth in both periods was driven primarily by purchases of cost-per-click advertising. In each of 2017, 2016 and 2015, a majority of ad clicks were delivered on mobile.\nOur transactions revenue decreased $2.2 million, or 4%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $18.6 million, or 43%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in 2017 was a result of our sale of Eat24 to Grubhub in October 2017, as we no longer recognized revenue from transactions from Yelp Eat24. The increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily the result of increased transactions from Yelp Eat24, which was acquired in February 2015.\nOur other services revenue increased $9.6 million, or 180%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $1.9 million, or 56%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to the acquisitions of Nowait and Turnstyle as well as increased revenue from Yelp Reservations. The increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases in revenue from Yelp Reservations.\nAs of the beginning of 2016, we no longer offer brand advertising products. As a result, we generated no brand advertising revenue in 2017 or 2016.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of credit card processing fees, web hosting costs and employee costs (including stock-based compensation expense) for our infrastructure teams related to the operation of our website and mobile app. It also includes confirmation services costs associated with Yelp Reservations, Yelp Nowait and Yelp WiFi Marketing, confirmation and delivery services associated with Yelp Eat24 prior to its sale, as well as video production costs for our advertising customers. Following our sale of Eat24 in October 2017, there was an initial reduction in our cost of revenue associated with credit card transactions,\nas well as confirmation and delivery services. We expect cost of revenue associated with our advertising customers to increase in 2018 as we increase the number of customers, offset by a reduction in cost of revenue associated with our transactions business as a result of our disposal of Eat24.\n\nCost of revenue increased $10.2 million, or 17%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $9.3 million, or 18%, in 2016 compared to 2015. Website infrastructure expense increased $5.4 million and $1.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, which primarily consists of website hosting and employee-related costs associated with employees supporting the hosting of the website. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in the number of visitors to, and increased transactions completed on, our website compared to the prior year, as well as increased headcount for personnel supporting the website infrastructure. The increase in website infrastructure expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was comparatively less than that of 2017 compared to 2016 due to reduced server hosting costs achieved from improved pricing from key website hosting vendors.\nCost of revenue also increased by $3.1 million and $0.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, compared to the prior year periods, as a result of increases in confirmation services and third-party food delivery costs. The increase in 2017 was due to an increase in the number of Yelp Eat24 transactions, and increased confirmation services expenses associated with Yelp Reservations, as well as Yelp Nowait and Yelp WiFi Marketing following our acquisitions of Nowait and Turnstyle. Additionally, cost of revenue increased in 2017 and 2016 as a result of increases of $2.4 million and $6.9 million, respectively, in merchant fees related to credit card transactions due to growth in advertising and transactions revenue. The rate of increase in these costs in 2017 was lower than the increase in 2016 as a result of the sale of Yelp Eat24 in 2017, and the slower growth rate in advertising revenue that year. In 2017, set up and creative design costs decreased by $0.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in video production costs. In 2016, set up and creative design costs increased by $1.2 million due to greater demand by businesses for video on their business listing pages.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee costs (including incentive compensation expense and stock-based compensation expense) for our sales and marketing employees. In addition, sales and marketing expenses include business and consumer acquisition marketing, community management, branding and advertising costs, as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs.\nFollowing our disposal of Eat24 to Grubhub in October 2017, we ceased marketing activities related to Yelp Eat24 and over 300 Yelp Eat24 sales and marketing employees transferred to Grubhub. While we have redeployed the remaining sales employees and resources previously associated with Eat24 within our organization, the Eat24 sale resulted in an initial reduction in our sales and marketing expenses. However, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we expand our communities, increase the number of advertising and subscription accounts and continue to build the Yelp brand in the United States and Canada. We expect the majority of sales and marketing expense increases for the foreseeable future to be related to hiring sales employees, as well as to costs incurred with various third-party media outlets and other advertising channels.\n\nSales and marketing expenses increased $55.8 million, or 15%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $81.1 million, or 27%, in 2016 compared 2015. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily attributable to $42.8 million and $48.5 million, respectively, in additional salaries benefits, travel and other related expenses resulting from increases in headcount, including increases in stock-based compensation expense of $1.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively, as we expanded our sales organization to increase the number of paying advertising accounts and grow revenue from existing customers in the United States and Canada. We also experienced increases in facilities and other overhead allocations of $6.1 million and $10.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as we leased additional office space and incurred additional costs for our expanding headcount. As a result of our increases in net\nrevenue, our commission expenses increased by $4.6 million and $7.8 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, as a result of ongoing business and consumer marketing campaigns, marketing and advertising costs increased by $2.3 million and $14.8 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nProduct Development\nOur product development expenses primarily consist of employee costs (including stock-based compensation expense) for our engineers, product management and information technology personnel. In addition, product development expenses include outside services and consulting costs, as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We believe that continued investment in features, software development tools and code modification is important to attaining our strategic objectives and, as a result, we expect product development expenses to continue to increase for the foreseeable future. Although our sale of Eat24 will reduce our product development expenses associated with the Yelp Eat24 product, we have redeployed the associated internal resources elsewhere within our organization and do not expect the sale to have a material impact on our overall product development expenses as a result.\n\nProduct development expenses increased $37.2 million, or 27%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $30.8 million, or 29%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily attributable to $30.4 million and $27.9 million, respectively, in additional salaries and benefits associated with an increase in headcount, including increases in stock-based compensation expense (net of capitalized stock-based compensation expense) of $11.0 million and $12.9 million, respectively. In addition, we experienced increases in facilities and other overhead allocations of $6.0 million and $5.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as we leased additional office space and incurred additional costs for our expanding headcount.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee costs (including stock-based compensation expense) for our executive, finance, user operations, legal, human resources and other administrative employees. Our general and administrative expenses also include bad debt expenses, outside consulting, legal and accounting services, as well as facilities other supporting overhead costs. We expect bad debt expenses to increase as our advertising revenue continues to grow, and our other general and administrative costs should also increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our business. We do not expect our disposal of Eat24 to have a material impact on our general and administrative costs.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $8.2 million, or 8%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $16.6 million, or 21%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily attributable to $5.7 million and $12.1 million, respectively, in additional salaries, benefits, travel and related expenses associated with an increase in headcount, including increases in stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively. In 2017, the increase was also driven by an increase in one-time bonuses incurred in the year. Bad debt expense increased by $1.0 million in 2017 and $5.6 million in 2016 due to continued growth in advertising revenue. The rate of increase in bad debt expense in 2017 was less than that of 2016 as a result of improved collections rates from advertising customers.\nIn 2017, the use of outside consultants increased by $1.4 million as we invested in our systems and support for the growth of the business. In 2016, there was a decrease in consulting costs of $2.6 million due to decreased reliance on outside consultants. Facilities and other related allocations in 2017 were consistent with those in the prior year. We experienced an increase in facilities and other overhead allocations of $1.5 million in 2016, as a result of the increase in headcount.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on computer equipment, software, leasehold improvements, capitalized website and software development costs and amortization of purchased intangible assets. We expect depreciation expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our technology infrastructure, and lease additional office space. Amortization expense is likely to be lower for the foreseeable future as a result of the disposition of intangible assets in our sale of Eat24 to Grubhub in October 2017.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $5.9 million, or 17%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and $5.7 million, or 19%, in 2016 compared to 2015. These increases were primarily the result of our investments in expanding our technology infrastructure and capital assets to support our increase in headcount across the organization. Depreciation and amortization expenses related to our property, equipment and capitalized website and software development costs increased $6.1 million and $5.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRestructuring and Integration\n\nOn November 2, 2016, we announced plans to significantly reduce sales and marketing activities in markets outside of the United States and Canada. The restructuring plan was substantially completed by December 31, 2016. We incurred $0.3 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in restructuring and integration costs associated with this plan related to severance costs for affected employees. No further expense for this plan is expected after December 31, 2017. No goodwill, intangibles or other long lived assets were impaired as a result of the restructuring plan.\nGain on Disposal of a Business Unit\n\nOur disposal of Eat24 to Grubhub on October 10, 2017 resulted in a $164.8 million pre-tax gain. The gain recorded was calculated as proceeds from the disposal, offset by the net assets of Eat24 as of the disposal date, and costs specifically incurred as a result of the sale.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists primarily of the interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and foreign exchange gains and losses.\n\nOther income, net increased by $3.2 million in 2017 compared to 2016, and $1.3 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by an increase in interest income earned on marketable investments and cash held in interest-bearing accounts.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, deferred income taxes reflecting the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, generation of income tax credits and the realization of net operating loss carryforwards.\n\nIn 2017, we recognized income tax expense of $31.5 million, primarily related to the income tax on the gain on disposal of Eat24, offset by the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits and the corresponding release of valuation allowance. Income tax expense increased $30.1 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the gain on disposal of a business unit. Income tax expense decreased $10.6 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the valuation allowance recorded in 2015 against certain deferred tax assets.\nIt is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months there may be sufficient positive evidence to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance. Release of this valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the net income that we are able to actually achieve. We will continue to evaluate the possible release of valuation allowance on a quarterly basis.\nQuarterly Results of Operations and Other Data\nThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2017 (in thousands, except per share data). We also present other financial and operational data and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. We have prepared this quarterly data on a consistent basis with the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. In the opinion of management, the quarterly financial information reflects all necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of this data. This information should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period.\n\n (1) Includes non-cash stock-based compensation expense as follows (in thousands): \n\nThe following table presents other financial and operational data (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) For information on how we define these operational and other metrics, see -Key Metrics.\u201d  The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $547.9 million. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, money market funds and investments with original maturities of less than three months. Our cash held internationally as of December 31, 2017 was $6.4 million. We did not have any outstanding bank loans or credit facilities in place as of December 31, 2017. Our investment portfolio comprises highly rated marketable securities, and our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires securities to be investment grade (i.e. rated \u2018A' or higher by bond rating firms) with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. To date, we have been able to finance our operations and our acquisitions through proceeds from private and public financings, including our initial public offering in March 2012, our follow-on offering in October 2013, cash generated from operations and, to a lesser extent, cash provided by the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended ( ESPP\u201d). In addition, on October 10, 2017, we completed our sale of Eat24 to Grubhub and received $252.7 million in cash, with an additional $28.8 million that is currently being held in escrow for an 18-month period after closing to secure our indemnification obligations in connection with the sale.\nOur future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with any cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and anticipated purchases of property and equipment for at least the next 12 months. However, this estimate is based on a number of assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could exhaust our available cash and cash equivalents earlier than presently anticipated. We may require or otherwise seek additional funds in the next 12 months to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features and products or enhance existing services, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies, and, accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds.\nAmounts deposited with third-party financial institutions exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance limits, as applicable. These cash and cash equivalents could be impacted if the underlying\nfinancial institutions fail or are subjected to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities. We generated $167.6 million of cash in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily resulting from our net income of $152.9 million, which included the gain on disposal of Eat24 of $164.8 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses of $41.2 million, non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $100.4 million, and non-cash provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $18.4 million. In addition, significant changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted from the following:\n \u2022 increase in accounts receivable of $32.1 million due to an increase in billings for advertising plans, particularly those customers billed in-arrears, as well as the timing of payments from these customers; \n \u2022 increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $52.9 million, primarily driven by an increase in income taxes payable associated with the gain on disposal of Eat24, accrued bonus and commissions, and various other accrued operating costs and expenses as a result of the growth in our business, offset by a decrease in restaurant revenue share liability as a result of the disposal of Eat24; and \n \u2022 increase in prepaids and other assets of $1.4 million, primarily due to an increase in tenant improvement allowance receivable and prepaid licenses.  We generated $126.9 million of cash in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily resulting from our net loss of $4.7 million, which included non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses of $35.3 million, non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $86.3 million and non-cash provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $17.3 million. In addition, significant changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted from the following:\n \u2022 increase in accounts receivable of $31.6 million due to an increase in billings for advertising plans, as well as the timing of payments from these customers; \n \u2022 increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $15.3 million, primarily driven by an increase in restaurant revenue share liability, accrued vacation and employee-related expenses, and the timing of invoices and payments to the vendors, particularly marketing-related vendors; and \n \u2022 decrease in prepaids and other assets of $5.7 million, primarily due to the collection of non-trade receivables.  We generated $57.4 million of cash in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily resulting from our net loss of $32.9 million, which included non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses of $29.6 million, non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $60.8 million, non-cash provision for doubtful accounts of $16.8 million and a $20.3 million expense related to a valuation allowance recorded against certain domestic and foreign deferred tax assets. In addition, significant changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted from the following:\n \u2022 increase in accounts receivable of $25.3 million due to an increase in billings for advertising plans, as well as the timing of payments from these customers; \n \u2022 increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $15.9 million related to the growth in our business, increase in restaurant revenue share liability, accrued vacation and employee-related expenses, and the timing of invoices and payments to vendors; and \n \u2022 increase in prepaids and other assets of $22.7 million relating to an increase in prepayments (primarily for marketing and business licenses) and deferred tax benefits. \nInvesting Activities. Our primary investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of purchases of marketable securities, acquisitions of businesses, the sale of a business unit, purchases of property and equipment to support the ongoing build out of leasehold improvements for our new facilities in San Francisco, Washington D.C. and other locations, the purchase of technology hardware to support our growth in headcount and internally developed software to support website and mobile app development, website operations and our corporate infrastructure. Purchases of property, equipment and software may vary from period to period due to the timing of the expansion of our offices, operations and website and internal-use software and development. We expect our investment in property and equipment, leasehold assets and the development of software in 2018 to grow from 2017 levels.\nWe generated $79.9 million of cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash provided by investing activities primarily related to $252.7 million net cash received for the sale of Eat24 to Grubhub on October 10, 2017 and $264.0 million of maturities of investment securities held-to-maturity. Cash provided by investing was offset by purchases of marketable securities of $354.9 million, purchases of property, equipment and software of $15.6 million to support the growth in our business, expenditures related to website and internally developed software of $14.6 million, as well as our acquisition of Nowait for net cash consideration of $30.8 million, which included intangible assets of $12.7 million, and our acquisition of Turnstyle for net cash consideration of $19.7 million, which included intangible assets of $4.3 million.\nWe used $55.6 million of cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash used in investing activities primarily related to purchases of marketable securities of $275.0 million, expenditures related to website and internally developed software of $14.2 million, purchases of property, equipment and software of $23.0 million to support the growth in our business, our investment of $8.0 million in the preferred stock of Nowait and purchases of intangible data licenses of $0.2 million. In addition, as part of our lease agreements for additional office space, we were obligated to deliver additional letters of credit, which resulted in an increase of $0.8 million in restricted cash. Cash used in investing was offset by $265.5 million of maturities of investment securities held-to-maturity.\nWe used $158.7 million of cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash used in investing activities primarily related to the $73.4 million cash portion of the purchase price of Eat24, purchases of marketable securities of $246.2 million, expenditures related to website and internally developed software of $11.7 million, purchases of intangible data licenses of $0.6 million and purchases of property, equipment, software and leasehold improvements of $31.1 million to support the growth in our business. Cash used in investing was offset by $202.9 million of maturities of investment securities held-to-maturity and the release of restrictions on cash of $1.4 million.\nFinancing Activities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $27.2 million in financing activities, primarily due to net proceeds of $30.0 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and $10.9 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock under the ESPP. Cash provided by financing activities was offset by $12.6 million in repurchases of common stock and $1.2 million of taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards for our international employees.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated $29.5 million in financing activities, primarily due to net proceeds of $20.6 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and $8.9 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock under the ESPP.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated $26.4 million in financing activities, primarily due to net proceeds of $12.3 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options, $8.9 million in net proceeds from the sale of stock under our ESPP and $6.6 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based award activity.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn July 2017, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $200 million of our outstanding common stock. We may purchase shares at our discretion in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, in transactions structured through investment banking institutions, or a combination of the foregoing. The program is not subject to any time limit and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. The amount and timing of repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including liquidity, cash flow and market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased 302,206 shares on the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $12.6 million and had retired 301,106 of these shares as of December 31, 2017; the remaining treasury shares were subsequently retired in 2018. We funded these repurchases, and expect to fund any future repurchases under the stock repurchase program, with cash available on our balance sheet, which will continue to increase the cash used in investing activities.\nNet Share Settlement of Equity Awards\nIn 2017, we began settling the employee tax liabilities associated with the vesting of RSUs through net share withholding - rather than selling a portion of the vested shares to cover taxes, as we had previously - for international employees. As a result, we paid $1.2 million of employee taxes out of cash held on our consolidated balance sheet. Although we continued to sell a portion of vested shares to cover such taxes for U.S.-based employees in 2017, we intend to begin net share withholding for them as well in 2018, which will result in an increase in cash used in financing activities in 2018.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 303(a)(4)(ii) promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act, in 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nContractual Obligations\nWe lease various office facilities, including our corporate headquarters in San Francisco, California, under operating lease agreements that expire from 2018 to 2029. The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease periods. We do not have any debt or material capital lease obligations, and all of our property, equipment and software have been purchased with cash. As of December 31, 2017, we had no material long-term purchase obligations outstanding with vendors or third parties other than obligations related to the fit out of certain leasehold properties. As of December 31, 2017, the following table summarizes our future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases and purchase obligations for equipment and office facilities (in thousands):\n\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with binding agreements and do not include obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, our total liability for uncertain tax positions was $3.4 million of the total unrecognized benefit of $18.2 million. We are not reasonably able to estimate the timing of future cash flow related to this liability. As a result, this amount is not included in the contractual obligations table above.\nWe have subleased certain office facilities under operating lease agreements that expire in 2021. The terms of these lease agreements provide for rental receipts on a graduated basis. We recognize sublease rentals on a straight-line basis over the lease periods reflected as a reduction in rental expense. As of December 31, 2017, our future minimum rental receipts to be received under non-cancelable subleases were $6.5 million.", "item_7_tables": "Table 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

Yelp generates most of its revenue from advertising products. Advertising revenue was $771.6 million in 2017, up 20% from 2016. This growth was driven by expanding the sales force to reach more businesses.\n\n2. Transactions revenue comes from food ordering, reservations, and other transactions on Yelp's platform. It declined 4% to $60.3 million in 2017 due to the sale of Eat24 to Grubhub in October 2017. \n\n3. Other services revenue, which includes Yelp Reservations and Yelp WiFi Marketing, grew 180% to $14.9 million in 2017 thanks to acquisitions and increased Yelp Reservations revenue.\n\n4. Total revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $846.8 million in 2017. Sales and marketing remains the largest operating expense at 52% of revenue as Yelp continues expanding its communities and sales organization.\n\n5. Yelp had net income of $152.9 million in 2017 versus a net loss of $4.7 million in 2016, thanks to a $164.8 million pre-tax gain on the sale of Eat24.\n\n6. As of December 31, 2017, Yelp had $547.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt. The company expects to continue investing aggressively in the business with its cash balances.\n\nIn summary, Yelp showed strong growth in 2017 led by its core advertising products. The sale of Eat24 also provided a significant one-time gain. Going forward, Yelp plans to reinvest its cash into expanding communities, its sales organization, and new initiatives to drive future growth."}
