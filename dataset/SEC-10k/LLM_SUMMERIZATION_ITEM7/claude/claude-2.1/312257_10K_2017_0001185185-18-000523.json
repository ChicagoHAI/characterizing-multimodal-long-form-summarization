Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, as well as all other related notes, and financial and operational references, appearing elsewhere in this document.\nCertain information contained in this discussion and elsewhere in this report may include forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and is subject to the safe harbor created by that act.

These estimates include certain assumptions related to doubtful accounts receivable, stock-based services, valuation of financial instruments, and income taxes. On an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Accounts subject to estimate and judgements are accounts receivable reserves, income taxes, intangible assets, contingent liabilities, and equity based instruments. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe our estimates have not been materially inaccurate in past years, and our assumptions are not likely to change in the foreseeable future.\n(a) Warrants:\nThe following table illustrates

The Company has an operational relationship of several years with our major customers, and we believe this experience provides us with a solid foundation from which to estimate our expected losses on accounts receivable. Should our sales mix change or if we develop new lines of business or new customers, these estimates and our estimation process will change accordingly. These estimates have been accurate in the past.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The estimated fair values approximate their carrying value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments or the stated interest rates are indicative of market interest rates. These fair values have historically varied due to the market price of the Company's stock at the date of valuation. Generally, these liabilities increased as the price of the Company's stock increased (with resultant gain), and decreased as the Company's stock decreased (yielding a loss). In December 2012, the Company removed these liabilities from its balance sheet by reclassifying them as equity.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has a history of losses, and as such has recorded no liability for income taxes. Until such time as the Company begins to provide evidence that a continued profit is a reasonable expectation, management will not determine that there is a basis for accruing an income tax liability. These estimates have been accurate in the past. At December 31, 2017, the Company has a net operating loss carryforward of $3,400,000.\nIndex\nBackground\nWe were initially formed in June 1979 as Alpha Solarco Inc., a Colorado corporation. From June 1979 through February 2003, we were either inactive or involved in discontinued business ventures. We changed our name to Fiber Application Systems Technology, Ltd in February 2003. In January 2004, we changed our state of incorporation by merging into Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. (IVFH), a Florida corporation formed for that purpose. As a result of the merger, we changed our name to that of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. In January 2004, we also acquired Food Innovations, Inc. ( FII\u201d or Food Innovations\u201d), a Delaware corporation, for 500,000 shares of our common stock.\nOn November 2, 2012, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Haley Acquisition\u201d) with The Haley Group, LLC whereby we acquired all existing assets of The Haley Group, LLC and its customers. The Haley Acquisition was valued at a total cost of $119,645. On June 30, 2014, pursuant to a purchase agreement, the Company purchased 100% of the membership interest of Organic Food Brokers, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company ( OFB\u201d), for $300,000, 100,000 4 year options at a price of $1.46 per share, and up to an additional $225,000 in earn-outs if certain milestones are met. Pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of January 1, 2017 the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Oasis Sales Corp. ( Oasis\u201d), purchased substantially all of the assets of Oasis Sales and Marketing, L.L.C. for $300,000 cash; a $200,000 structured equity instrument which can be paid in cash or shares of the Company stock at the Company's option, anytime under certain conditions, or is automatically payable via the issuance of 200,000 shares if the Company's shares close above $1.00 for ten consecutive days; a $100,000 note; and up to an additional $400,000 in earn-outs over two years if certain milestones are met. The Agreement also contains claw-back provisions if certain revenue conditions are not met.\nOn August 15, 2014, pursuant to a merger agreement (the Fresh Diet Merger Agreement\u201d), the Company acquired The Fresh Diet, Inc. ( The Fresh Diet\u201d or FD\u201d) through a reverse triangular merger as the registrant created a subsidiary corporation (FD Acquisition Corp) that merged with and into FD with FD being the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The purchase price consisted of 10,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock valued at $14,000,000. The majority of FD's current liabilities consisted of approximately $3.8 million of deferred revenues and approximately $2.1 million in short term commercial loans and there were additional ordinary course of business expenses such as trade payables, payroll and sales taxes which varied from month to month. In addition, it had some long term obligations the bulk of which consisted of interest free loans from FD's former shareholders in the amount of approximately $2.2 million which were not due for three years. Prior to the merger FD had purchased an immaterial amount of product from the Company. FD operated as an independent subsidiary subject to oversight of its board of directors and the Company's President and CEO. Effective February 23, 2016, the Company closed a transaction to sell 90% of our ownership in FD to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD who was appointed Interim CEO of FD on February 9, 2016. The consideration to Innovative Food Holdings consisted primarily of a restructuring of our loans, which includes the ability to convert to additional amounts of FD under certain circumstances. Aside from payments related to previously accrued liabilities there were no cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations.\nEffective January 24, 2018, pursuant to an asset acquisition agreement (the iGourmet Asset Acquisition Agreement\u201d), our wholly-owned subsidiary, Innovative Gourmet, LLC acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of iGourmet LLC and iGourmet NY LLC, privately-held New York limited liability companies located in West Pittston, Pennsylvania and engaged in the sale, marketing, and distribution of specialty food and specialty food items through www.igourmet.com, online marketplaces, additional direct-to-consumer platforms, distribution to foodservice, retail stores and other wholesale accounts, pursuant to the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement.\nTransactions With a Major Customer\nTransactions with a major customer and related economic dependence information is set forth (1) following our discussion of Liquidity and Capital Resources, (2) under the heading Major Customer in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and (3) in Business - Relationship with U.S. Foods, and (4) as the second item under Risk Factors.\nIndex\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPrior year balances have been recast to reflect the sale of 90% of our interest in FD in February 2016. Results of discontinued operations are excluded from the accompanying results of operations for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted. See Note 2 - discontinued operations in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nThis discussion may contain forward looking-statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our future results could differ materially from the forward looking-statements discussed in this report. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in the report.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by $6,072,329 or approximately 17.3% to $41,244,717 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $35,172,388 in the prior year.\nWe continue to assess the potential of new revenue sources from the manufacture and sale of proprietary food products, private label products and additional sales channel opportunities in both the foodservice and consumer space and will implement a strategy which based on our analysis provides the most beneficial opportunity for growth.\nAny changes in the food distribution and specialty foods operating landscape that materially hinders our current ability and/or cost to deliver our products to our customers could potentially cause a material impact on our net revenue and gross margin and, therefore, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nCurrently, a small portion of our revenues comes from imported products or international sales. Our current sales from such markets may be hampered and negatively impacted by any economic tariffs that may be imposed in the United States or in foreign countries.\nSee Transactions with Major Customers\u201d and the Securities and Exchange Commission's ( SEC\u201d) mandated FR-60 disclosures following the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section for a further discussion of the significant customer concentrations, loss of significant customer, critical accounting policies and estimates, and other factors that could affect future results.\nCost of goods sold\nOur cost of goods sold for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $27,619,026, an increase of $3,116,762 or approximately 12.7% compared to cost of goods sold of $24,502,264 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Cost of goods sold is made up of the following expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017: cost of goods of specialty, meat, game, cheese, seafood, poultry and other sales categories in the amount of $19,792,767; and shipping, delivery, handling, and purchase allowance expenses in the amount of $7,826,259. Total gross margin was approximately 33.1% of sales in 2017 compared to approximately 30.3% of sales in 2016. The increase in cost of goods sold is primary attributable to an increase in sales. The increase in gross margins from 2016 are primarily attributable to variation in product and revenue mix across our various selling channels.\nIn 2017, we continued to price our products in order to gain market share and increase the number of our end users. We were successful in both increasing sales and increasing market share. We currently expect, if market conditions and our product revenue mix remain constant, that our cost of goods sold may increase.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $1,566,375 or approximately 21.3% to $8,936,709 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7,370,334 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs of approximately $539,366 (net of a decrease in non-cash compensation in the amount of $504,873), and an increase in professional and legal costs in the amount of $564,653. The increase in payroll was due primarily to the acquisition of Oasis in January, 2017; the increase in legal and professional fees was due primarily to legal activities including legal and accounting expenses related the acquisition of certain assets of iGourmet LLC, and in addition, to other legal, litigation and accounting related expenses in 2017.\nIndex\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased by $323,665 or approximately 67.0% to $159,720 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $483,385 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in amortization of the discount on notes payable, which was $185,018 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $185,018 compared to $370,036 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. In addition, interest accrued or interest paid or accrued on the Company's commercial loans and notes payable decreased by $42,860 to $76,635 during the current period, compared to $119,495 during the prior year, and interest income increased by $9,698 to $15,844 during the current period compared to $6,146 during the prior year. The Company also had a reduction of interest as a result of negotiations with certain noteholders which resulted in a reduction of accrued interest in the amount of $86,089. Without this adjustment, and adding back interest income of $15,844, gross interest expense would have been $261,653 for the period.\nNet income from continuing operations\nFor the reasons above, the Company had net income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 of $4,529,262 which is an increase of approximately $1,712,857 or 60.8% compared to a net income of $2,816,405 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The income for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a total of $1,158,265 in non-cash charges, including amortization of intangible assets in the amount of $370,768, depreciation expense of $162,705, charges for non-cash compensation in the amount of $439,774, and amortization of the discount on notes payable in the amount of $185,018. The income for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a total of $1,837,094 in non-cash charges, including amortization of intangible assets in the amount of $232,768, depreciation expense of $158,143, charges for non-cash compensation in the amount of $1,076,147, and amortization of the discount on notes payable in the amount of $370,036.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources at December 31, 2017\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had current assets of $8,526,132, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $5,133,435; trade accounts receivable of $2,042,505; inventory of $937,962; notes receivable of $325,500; and other current assets of $86,730. Also at December 31, 2017, the Company had current liabilities of $2,399,274, consisting of trade payables and accrued liabilities of $1,836,559; accrued interest of $15,860; current portion of notes payable and capital leases of $346,855; and current portion of contingent liability of $200,000.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had cash provided by operating activities of $3,419,402. Cash flow from operations consisted of the Company's consolidated net income of $4,529,262 plus non-cash compensation in the amount of $439,774; non-cash amortization of discount on notes payable of $185,018; and depreciation and amortization of $533,473. The Company's cash position decreased by $2,268,125 as a result of changes in the components of current assets and current liabilities, primarily a reduction in accrued liabilities related to related to discontinued operations in the amount of $1,478,887.\nThe Company had cash used in investing activities of $675,345 for the year ended December 31, 2017, which consisted of cash paid in the acquisition of Oasis in the amount of $300,000, cash loaned to iGourmet LLC under a note agreement in the amount of $325,500; and cash paid for the acquisition of property and equipment in the amount of $49,845. The Company had cash used in financing activities of $1,374,675 for the year ended December 31, 2017, which consisted of principal payments made on notes payable of $997,544; principal payments on capital leases of $9,287, payments made for the purchase of treasury stock of $505,660; and payments made for the purchase of options from officers, directors, and employees of $163,925. The Company also received cash of $196,741 from the exercise of warrants for common stock, and $105,000 from the exercise of common stock options.\nThe Company had net working capital of $6,126,858 as of December 31, 2017. The Company had cash provided by operations during the year ended December 31, 2017 in the amount of $3,419,402; this amount is net of certain payments in the amount of $1,478,887 related to discontinued operations which relate mainly to a transaction to purchase the rights to 1,450,000 RSUs and 642,688 shares of the Company's common stock from a former FD employee which resulted in $850,000 in non-recurring cash payments. This compares to cash generated from operating activities of $3,469,096 during the year ended December 31, 2016. Without the cash flow items associated with discontinued operations, operating cash flow would have been $4,898,289 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company intends to continue to focus on increasing market share and cash flow from operations by focusing its sales activities on specific market segments and new product lines. Currently, we do not have any material long-term obligations other than those described in Note 13 to the financial statements included in this report. As we seek to increase our sales of new items and enter new markets, acquire new businesses as well as identify new and other consumer and food service oriented products and services, we may use existing cash reserves, long-term financing, or other means to finance such diversification.\nIndex\nIn February 2016, we completed the sale of FD to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD. See Note 3 to the accompanying financial statements.\nIf the Company's cash flow from operations is insufficient to fully implement its business plan, the Company may require additional financing in order to execute its operating plan. The Company cannot predict whether this additional financing will be in the form of equity or debt, or be in another form. The Company may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIn any of these events, the Company may be unable to implement its current plans for expansion, repay its debt obligations as they become due or respond to competitive pressures, any of which circumstances would have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n2018 Plans\nDuring 2018, in addition to our efforts to increase sales in our existing foodservice operations we plan to attempt to expand our business by expanding our focus to additional specialty foods markets in both the consumer and foodservice sector, exploring potential acquisition and partnership opportunities and continuing to extend our focus in the specialty food market through the growth of the Company's existing sales channels and through a variety of additional sales channel relationships which are currently being explored. In addition, we are currently exploring the introduction of a variety of new product categories and new product lines, including private label products and proprietary branded products to leverage our existing foodservice and consumer customer base.\nFurthermore, the Company intends to expand its activities in the direct to consumer space and the overall consumer packaged goods (CPG) space through leveraging the assets acquired from iGourmet LLC and through leveraging its overall capabilities in the consumer space.\nNo assurances can be given that any of these plans will come to fruition or that if implemented that they will necessarily yield positive results.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nInflation\nIn the opinion of management, inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of its operations.\nTransactions with Major Customers\nThe Company's largest customer, US Foods, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 72% of total sales in each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. A contract between our subsidiary, Food Innovations, and USF entered an optional renewal period in December 2012 but was automatically extended for an additional 12 months in each of January 1, 2013 and 2014. On January 26, 2015 we executed a contract between Food Innovations, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and U.S. Foods, Inc. The term of the Agreement is from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016 and provides for a limited number of automatic annual renewals thereafter if no party gives the other 30 days' notice of its intent not to renew. Based on the terms, the Agreement was extended through 2018. Effective January 1, 2018 the Agreement was further amended to remove the cap on renewals, and provide for an unlimited number of additional 12-month terms unless either party notifies the other in writing, 30 days prior to the end date, of its intent not to renew.\nIndex\nITEM 8. Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nInnovative Food Holdings, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., and subsidiaries (the Company\u201d) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ( PCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Liggett & Webb, P.A.\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.\nNew York, NY\nMarch 29, 2018\nIndex\nInnovative

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBusiness Activity\nOur business is currently conducted by our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Artisan ( Artisan\u201d), Food Innovations ( FII\u201d), Food New Media Group, Inc. ( FNM\u201d), Organic Food Brokers ( OFB\u201d), Gourmet Food Service Group, Inc. ( GFG\u201d), Gourmet Foodservice Warehouse, Inc. ( GFW\u201d), Gourmeting, Inc. ( Gourmeting\u201d), The Haley Group, Inc. ( Haley\u201d), Oasis ( Oasis\u201d), 4 The Gourmet, Inc. (d/b/a For The Gourmet, Inc.), ( Gourmet\u201d); Innovative Gourmet, LLC ( Innovative Gourmet\u201d); and Food Funding, LLC ( Food Funding\u201d and collectively with IVFH and its other subsidiaries, the Company\u201d or IVFH\u201d). Overall, our focus is on distribution or the enabling of distribution of specialty food products ranging from specialty foodservice products to Consumer Packaged Goods ( CPG\u201d) products Since its incorporation, the Company primarily through FII's relationship with the producers, growers, and makers of thousands of unique specialty foodservice products and through its relationship with US Foods, Inc. ( U.S. Foods\u201d or USF\u201d), has been in the business of providing premium restaurants, within 24 - 72 hours, with the freshest origin-specific perishable, and healthcare products shipped directly from our network of vendors and from our warehouses. Our customers include restaurants, hotels, country clubs, national chain accounts, casinos, hospitals and catering houses. Gourmet has been in the business of providing specialty food e-commerce consumers, through its own website at www.forthegourmet.com and though www.amazon.com, with unique specialty gourmet food products shipped directly from our network of vendors and from our warehouses within 24 - 72 hours. GFG is focused on expanding the Company's program offerings to additional customers. In our business model, we receive orders from our customers and then work closely with our suppliers and our warehouse facilities to have the orders fulfilled. In order to maintain freshness and quality, we carefully select our suppliers based upon, among other factors, their quality, uniqueness, reliability and access to overnight courier services.\nArtisan is a supplier of over 1,500 unique specialty foodservice products to over 500 customers in the Greater Chicago area. Haley provides consulting services and other solutions to its clients in the food industry. Haley is a dedicated foodservice consulting and advisory firm that works closely with companies to access private label and manufacturers' private label food service opportunities with the intent of helping them launch and commercialize new products in the broadline foodservice industry and get products distributed via national broadline food distributors. OFB and Oasis function as outsourced national sales and brand management teams for emerging organic and specialty food Consumer Packaged Goods ( CPG\u201d) companies and provides emerging CPG specialty food brands with distribution and shelf placement access in all of the major metro markets in the food retail industry.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn February 23, 2016, the Company consummated the sale of 90% of our ownership in FD. As a result of the sale, the results of operations for all periods have been included in Net income from discontinued operations\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations. See Note 3 - Discontinued Operations for additional information.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Accounts subject to estimate and judgements are accounts receivable reserves, income taxes, intangible assets, contingent liabilities, and equity based instruments. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe our estimates have not been materially inaccurate in past years, and our assumptions are not likely to change in the foreseeable future.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Artisan, Food Innovations, FNM, OFB, GFG, Gourmet Foodservice Warehouse, Inc., Gourmeting, Inc., Haley, Innovative Gourmet, Food Funding, and Gourmet. All accounts of FD have been included under discontinued operations. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation of these entities.\nIndex\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue upon product delivery. All of our products are shipped either same day or overnight or through longer shipping terms to the customer and the customer takes title to product and assumes risk and ownership of the product when it is delivered. Shipping charges to customers and sales taxes collectible from customers, if any, are included in revenues.\nFor revenue from product sales, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB\u201d Accounting Standards Codification ASC\u201d 605-15-05. ASC 605-15-05 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company defers any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.\nCost of goods sold\nWe have included in cost of goods sold all costs which are directly related to the generation of revenue. These costs include primarily the cost of food and raw materials, packing and handling, shipping, and delivery costs.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nWe have included in selling, general, and administrative expenses all other costs which support the Company's operations but which are not includable as a cost of sales. These include primarily payroll, facility costs such as rent and utilities, selling expenses such as commissions and advertising, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation, and other administrative costs including professional fees and costs associated with non-cash stock compensation. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents include all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less which are not securing any corporate obligations.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company's estimate is based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable. It is reasonably possible that the Company's estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change. Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $63,267 and $8,123 at December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are valued at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives up to five years using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nThe estimated service lives of property and equipment are as follows:\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> Computer Equipment\n</td> <td> 3 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Warehouse Equipment\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Office Furniture and Fixtures\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vehicles\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInventories\nInventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and is determined by the first-in, first-out method.\nIndex\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets, including tax loss and credit carryforwards, and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amount of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable, line of credit, accounts payable and accrued expenses, none of which is held for trading, approximates their estimated fair values due to the short-term maturities of those financial instruments.\nThe Company adopted ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements\u201d (SFAS 157), which provides a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its property and equipment and any identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The test for impairment is required to be performed by management at least annually. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted operating cash flow expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nComprehensive Income\nASC 220-10-15 Reporting Comprehensive Income,\u201d establishes standards for reporting and displaying of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, ASC 220-10-15 requires that all items that are required to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. The Company does not have any items of comprehensive income in any of the periods presented.\nCost Method Investments\nThe Company has made several investments in early stage private food related companies and are accounting for these investments under the cost method.\nBasic and Diluted Income Per Share\nBasic net earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, while fully-diluted net earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive securities assumed to be outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive securities consist of options and warrants to purchase common stock, and convertible debt. Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.\nThe Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of outstanding stock options and warrants. Stock options and warrants for which the exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per common share and, accordingly, are excluded from the calculation.\nIndex\nDilutive shares at December 31, 2017:\nConvertible notes and interest\nAt Dec 31, 2017 the Company there are no convertible notes outstanding.\nWarrants\nAt Dec 31, 2017 there are no warrants outstanding.\nStock Options\nThe following table summarizes the options outstanding and the related prices for the options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock issued by the Company:\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Weighted\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Remaining\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exercise\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Number\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Contractual\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Price\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> of Options\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Life (years)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.57\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.02\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.04\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 200,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.83\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.31\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 200,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.50\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.38\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.92\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.42\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.47\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.43\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.00\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.46\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.50\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.60\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 310,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.01\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.70\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 75,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.28\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.90\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 175,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.48\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.00\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.28\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.40\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.41\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.50\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 37,500\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.28\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.40\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 30,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.41\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.50\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 37,500\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.28\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,510,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.89\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company is also committed to issue a total of 115,941 shares pursuant to the cashless conversion of an aggregate 500,000 options consisting of 300,000 options at a price of $0.35 per share, and 200,000 options at a price of $0.57 per share, The shares, which the Company intends to issue in April 2018, represent a net amount after aggregate cash payments of $167,000, which was a portion of the difference between the exercise price of the options and the market price of the stock on the date of purchase, and taxes.\nRSUs\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company cancelled all outstanding restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) and replaced them with common stock or restricted stock awards; see note 16.\nAt December 31, 2017, there are no RSUs outstanding.\nWe recognized stock-based compensation expense for RSUs in a straight-line manner over the vesting period of the grant. This resulted in stock-based compensation expense of $0 and $658,709 related to recognition of RSUs during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company cancelled unvested RSUs representing 1,370,000 shares of common stock and replaced them with restricted stock awards also representing 1,370,000 shares of common stock. The restricted stock awards vested over the same vesting period and under the same terms as the RSUs they replaced. Restricted stock awards representing 1,070,000 shares were vested at December 31, 2017; there are a total of 300,000 unvested restricted stock awards remaining. Those 300,000 restricted stock awards will vest as follows: 125,000 restricted stock awards will vest contingent upon the attainment of a stock price of $2.00 per share for 20 straight trading days, and an additional 175,000 restricted stock awards will vest contingent upon the attainment of a stock price of $3.00 per share for 20 straight trading days. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized expense of $240,208 for the vesting of restricted stock awards, the same amount of expense that would have been recognized had the RSUs not been replaced by the restricted stock awards. As the restricted stock awards were not in place during the year ended December 31, 2016, there was no such cost during that period.\nIndex\nDilutive shares at December 31, 2016:\nConvertible notes and interest\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding convertible notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of $647,565 with accrued interest of $626,873 convertible at the rate of $0.25 per share into an aggregate 5,097,752 shares of common stock. These notes were issued mainly as part of a debt financing into the Company in 2004 and have certain restrictions on repayment. The Company also has a note payable to a related party in the amount of $164,650 convertible at the rate of $0.25 per share into an aggregate of 658,600 shares of common stock.\nWarrants\nAlso at December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding warrants for holders to purchase the following additional shares: The following warrants were issued in connection to a 2004 equity investment into the Company: 2,294,493 shares exercisable at a price of $0.575 per share; 448,010 shares exercisable at a price of $0.55 per share; and 94,783 shares exercisable at a price of $0.25 per share. In addition the Company has 700,000 warrants outstanding exercisable at a price of $0.01 per share. These warrants were originally issued in connection with the issuance of a loan connected to the Artisan Specialty Foods acquisition. 800,000 of the original warrants were cancelled upon the early payment of the loan in 2012, leaving the current 700,000 connected to the Artisan loan previously outstanding.\nStock options\nThe following table summarizes the options outstanding and the related prices for the options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock issued by the Company at December 31, 2016:\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Weighted\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Remaining\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exercise\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Number of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Contractual\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prices\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Options\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Life (years)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.350\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,170,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.17\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.380\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92,500\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.50\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.400\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 275,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.51\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.450\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92,500\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.50\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.474\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92,500\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.50\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.480\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92,500\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.50\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.570\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 225,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.51\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.310\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 75,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.17\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.440\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.34\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.460\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.00\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.600\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 310,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.51\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.900\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.34\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 500,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.67\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.400\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.92\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.400\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 30,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.92\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,105,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.07\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRSUs\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company has issued restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) for the potential issuance of shares of the Company's common stock for the purpose of aligning executives and employees of the Company and for the purpose of compensation for serving as members of the Board of Directors of the Company and for the purposes of retaining qualified personnel at compensation levels that otherwise would not be available should the company have been required to pay certain salaries in cash only. Certain RSUs were issued to the executive officers of the Company ( Executive RSUs\u201d); certain RSUs were issued to the employees of the Company ( Employee RSUs\u201d); certain RSUs were issued to members of the board of directors of the Company ( Board RSUs\u201d); and certain of the RSUs were issued to employees of FD ( FD RSUs\u201d).\nIndex\nAt December 31, 2016, the following Executive RSUs were outstanding: A total of 1,737,072 RSUs were vested, and 800,000 will vest on July 1, 2017. An additional 125,000 RSUs will vest contingent upon the attainment of a stock price of $2.00 per share for 20 straight trading days, and an additional 175,000 RSUs will vest contingent upon the attainment of a stock price of $3.00 per share for 20 straight trading days. The Company estimated that the stock-price goals of the Company's stock price closing above $2.00 per share for 20 straight days have a 90% likelihood of achievement, and these RSUs were valued at 90% of their face value; the Company also estimated that the likelihood of the Company's stock closing above $3.00 per share for 20 straight days is 70%, and these RSUs were valued at 70% of their face value. We recognized stock-based compensation expense of in a straight-line manner over the vesting period of the RSUs.\nOn March 31, 2016, 10,000 Board RSUs were issued. On August 3, 2016, 95,000 Board RSUs were exercised by a former Board member. At December 31, 2016, the following Board RSUs were outstanding: a total of 545,000 RSUs were vested, and 270,000 vest on July 1, 2017.\nThe Employee RSUs were issued to certain nonexecutive employees of the Company either partially in lieu of salary, future bonuses or a combination of both bonus and salary. On March 31, 2016, 180,534 Employee RSUs were issued. At December 31, 2016, 180,534 Employee RSUs were outstanding, all of which were vested.\nOn January 26, 2016, 300,000 FD RSUs were exercised, and 800,000 FD RSUs were forfeited. On April 25, 2016, an additional 1,000,000 FD RSUs were forfeited. On June 29, 2016, 200,000 FD RSUs were exercised, and an additional 900,000 FD RSUs were forfeited. At December 31, 2016, 1,000,000 FD RSUs were outstanding; 600,000 were vested, and 400,000 were scheduled to vest on July 1, 2017.\nWe recognized stock-based compensation expense for RSUs in a straight-line manner over the vesting period of the grant. This resulted in stock-based compensation expense of $1,663,309 (including $813,908 charged to discontinued operations) and $4,206,282 (including $2,258,216 charged to discontinued operations) related to recognition of RSUs during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments and related items, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Company places its cash and temporary cash in investments with credit quality institutions. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had cash deposits in excess of applicable government mandated insurance limits in the amount of $3,470,000 and $2,971,942, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, trade receivables from the Company's largest customer amounted to 48% and 44%, respectively, of total trade receivables.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the use of assumptions, including the expected term of the award and the expected stock price volatility. We used the Company's historical volatility to estimate expected stock price volatility. The risk-free rate assumption was based on United States Treasury instruments whose terms were consistent with the expected term of the stock option. The expected dividend assumption was based on the Company's history and expectation of dividend payouts.\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) were measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. RSUs awarded may be conditional upon the attainment of one or more performance objectives over a specified period. At the end of the performance period, if the goals are attained, the awards are granted. Stock-based compensation expense was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and was reduced for estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates. The estimated annual forfeiture rates for stock options and RSUs are based on the Company's historical forfeiture experience. The estimated fair value of stock options and RSUs is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting term of the grant. Compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period based on management's best estimate as to whether it is probable that the shares awarded are expected to vest. Management assesses the probability of the performance milestones being met on a continuous basis.\nIndex\nOptions expense during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized in the table below:\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Option expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,847\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,752\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRSUs expense during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized in the table below:\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RSUs expense - Continuing operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 849,401\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RSUs expense - Discontinued operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 813,908\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,663,309\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to conform prior period data to the current presentation.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Stock Compensation - Scope of Modification Accounting, which provides guidance on which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The ASU requires that an entity should account for the effects of a modification unless the fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if used), vesting conditions and classification (as equity or liability) of the modified award are all the same as for the original award immediately before the modification. The ASU becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, and should be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company will apply this standard for any awards that are modified after January 1, 2018. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, current U.S. GAAP requires the performance of procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, the amendments under this ASU require the goodwill impairment test to be performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The ASU becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 which amends ASC Topic 230, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.\u201d The amendments in this update address eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The update outlines the classification of specific transactions as either cash inflows or outflows from financing activities, operating activities, investing activities or non-cash activities. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either operating or financing, with such classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and associated disclosures.\nIndex\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), to clarify the principles of recognizing revenue and create common revenue recognition guidance between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Under ASU 2014-09, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for such goods or services. In addition, ASU 2014-09 requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The new revenue standard is principle based and interpretation of those principles may vary from company to company based on their unique circumstances. It is possible that interpretation, industry practice, and guidance may evolve as companies and the accounting profession work to implement this new standard. The Company is still in the process of evaluating the effect of the new standard on the Company's historical financial statements and disclosures. While the Company has not completed its evaluation, the Company currently believes that the impact to revenue and expense recognized will not be material to any of the years presented.\nManagement does not believe that any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\n2. ACQUISITION\nPursuant to the Oasis Asset Purchase Agreement, effective January 1, 2017, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Oasis Sales Corp., purchased certain assets of Oasis Sales and Marketing, L.L.C., a California limited liability company. The purchase price consisted of $300,000 cash; a two-year promissory note in the amount of $100,000, and a structured equity instrument (the SEI\u201d) in the amount of $200,000. In addition, the Company is contingently liable for certain performance-based payments over the twenty-four months following the acquisition date up to a maximum of $400,000 ( Earnout Payments\u201d). Of this amount, $200,000 was carried as a current liability, and $200,000 was carried as a long-term liability on the Company's balance sheet at December 31, 2017.\nThe SEI was payable in cash or shares of the Company's stock at the Company's option, at any time, or is automatically payable via the issuance of 200,000 shares of the Company's stock if the Company's shares close above $1.00 for ten consecutive days. This requirement was met on November 28, 2017, and on that date the $200,000 SEI liability was converted to 200,000 shares of common stock.\nThe Company believes it is likely that the Earnout Payments will be made, and accordingly has recorded the entire amount of $400,000 as a contingent liability on its balance sheet as of the acquisition date. The amount of $800,000 was allocated to customer lists, an intangible asset with a useful life of 60 months; and the amount of $200,000 was allocated to a non-compete agreement, an intangible asset with a useful life of 48 months. A total of $210,000 was amortized to operations during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nEffective February 23, 2016, the Company closed a transaction to sell 90% of our ownership in The Fresh Diet, Inc. ( FD\u201d) to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD who was appointed Interim CEO of FD on February 9 , 2016 . The consideration to Innovative Food Holdings consisted primarily of a restructuring of our loans, which includes the ability to convert to additional amounts of FD under certain circumstances. There is no continuing cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company accrued the amount of $850,000 representing the amount due based on an agreement signed in 2017. The agreement involved the purchase of rights to 1,450,000 RSUs and the purchase of 642,688 shares of the Company's common stock (see note 16).\nASC 360-10-45-9 requires that a long-lived asset (disposal group) to be sold shall be classified as held for sale in the period in which a set of criteria have been met, including criteria that the sale of the asset (disposal group) is probable and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. This criteria was achieved on February 9, 2016. Additionally, the discontinued operations are comprised of the entirety of FD, excluding corporate services expenses. Lastly, for comparability purposes certain prior period line items relating to the assets held for sale have been reclassified and presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nIndex\nThe following information presents the major classes of line items constituting the

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nAcquisition of Building\nThe Company owns a building and property located at 28411 Race Track Road, Bonita Springs, Florida 34135. The property consists of approximately 1.1 acres of land and approximately 10,000 square feet of combined office and warehouse space, and was purchased as part of a bank short sale. The Company moved its operations to these premises on July 15, 2013. The purchase price of the property was $792,758.\nOn May 14, 2015, the Company purchased a building and property located at 2528 S. 27th Avenue, Broadview, Illinois 60155. The property consists of approximately 1.33 acres of land and approximately 28,711 square feet of combined office and warehouse space. The purchase price of $914,350 was initially financed primarily by a draw-down of $900,000 on the Company's credit facility with Fifth Third Bank. On May 29, 2015, a permanent financing facility was provided by Fifth Third Bank in the form of a loan in the amount of $980,000. $900,000 of this amount was used to pay the balance of the credit facility; the additional $80,000 was used for refrigeration and other improvements at the property. The interest on the loan is at the LIBOR rate plus 3.0%. The building is used for office and warehouse space for the Company's Artisan subsidiary. Depreciation on the building and the related improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment began when the Company occupied the facility in October, 2015.\nA summary of property and equipment at December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 385,523\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 385,523\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Building\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,326,165\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,326,165\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Computer and Office Equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 497,189\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 466,177\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Warehouse Equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 226,953\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 226,953\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Furniture and Fixtures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 473,572\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 454,743\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vehicles\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 40,064\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 40,064\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total before accumulated depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,949,466\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,899,625\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: accumulated depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (994,216\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (831,515\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,955,250\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,068,110\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndex\nDepreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment amounted to $162,705 and $158,143 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n8.

As detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for goodwill impairment, management has completed a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. To complete this review, management followed the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair value of goodwill and considered all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of goodwill. The analysis completed in 2017 and 2016 determined that there was no impairment to goodwill assets related to the Artisan and Haley transactions.\n10.

INCOME TAXES\nDeferred income taxes result from the temporary differences primarily attributable to amortization of intangible assets and debt discount and an accumulation of net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes with a valuation allowance against the carryforwards for book purposes.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Included in deferred tax assets are Federal and State net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $3,400,000, which will expire through 2037. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Due to significant changes in the Company's ownership, the Company's future use of its existing net operating losses may be limited.\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 consist of the following:\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable statutory income tax rate of 39.6% for the December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, to the loss before taxes as a result of the following differences:\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,529,262\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,816,405\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Statutory tax rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 39.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 39.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total tax at statutory rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,794,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,115,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Temporary differences\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 255,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 235,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permanent differences - restructuring\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,070,500\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permanent difference - meals and entertainment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permanent differences- non cash compensation, and discount amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 256,700\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 463,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,311,700\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,252,500\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in valuation allowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,311,700\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,252,500\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeferred income taxes reflect the tax impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations.\nDeferred income taxes include the net tax effects of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

The Tax Act establishes new tax laws that affect 2018 and future years, including a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. For certain deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, we have recorded a provisional decrease of $388,000, with a corresponding net adjustment to valuation allowance of $388,000 as of December 31, 2017.\n16.

These 1,070,000 shares were issued during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The vesting for the remaining 300,000 restricted stock awards is contingent upon meeting certain price and volume conditions related to the Company's stock; these conditions are the same conditions required for vesting of the cancelled RSUs.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nContingent Liability\nPursuant to the Oasis acquisition, the Company was contingently liable for certain performance-based payments over the twenty-four months following the acquisition date. At December 31, 2017, the Company carried the amount of $200,000 on its balance sheet as contingent liability - current, and an additional $200,000 as contingent liability - long term. See notes 2 and 16.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, the Company has become and may become involved in certain lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business, or as the result of current or previous investments, or current or previous subsidiaries, or current or previous employees, or current or previous directors, or as a result of acquisitions and dispositions or other corporate activities. The Company intends to vigorously defend its positions. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our financial position or our business and the outcome of these matters cannot be ultimately predicted.\nPNC Bank, National Association v. The Fresh Diet, Inc. f/k/a YS Catering, LLP f/k/a YS Catering, Inc., et al. / Scher Zalman Duchman and Deborah L. Duchman v. Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 17-cv-21027-KMM, United States District Court, Southern District of Florida\nOn July 7, 2017, Scher Zalman Duchman and Deborah L. Duchman (collectively, Duchmans\u201d) filed an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida seeking approximately $1 million in damages against Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., FD Acquisition Corp., and Sam Klepfish, IVFH's CEO. The Duchmans, amongst other things, allege that defendants owed a fiduciary duty to the Duchmans to minimize the Duchmans' own personal guarantees and personal obligations related to loans and other obligations incurred by a former subsidiary of the Company and that the Defendants did not fulfill that alleged fiduciary obligation. By Order dated March 22, 2018, the following causes of action were dismissed without prejudice: Count I, Breach of Fiduciary Duty; Count III, Unjust Enrichment; Count IV, Unjust Enrichment; and Count IX, Fraud in the Inducement. The Court further ordered Count XI, Punitive Damages, stricken from the Complaint and that all claims against Third Party Defendant FD Acquisition Corp. dismissed with prejudice. Discovery is ongoing, and IVFH will soon be filing a motion for summary judgment. The parties have scheduled required mediation. The court has provided a scheduled trial date. IVFH believes that this lawsuit is without merit and is an attempt by the Duchmans to drag IVFH into the Duchmans' personal financial matters which are unrelated to IVFH. While IVFH intends to vigorously defend against this lawsuit, the outcome of this lawsuit cannot ultimately be predicted.\nYS Catering Holdings, Inc., et al. vs. Attollo Partners LLC, Rajesh Rawal, Vojkan Dimitijevic, Asif Syed, Roy Heggland and Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., Case No. 2017-007504-CA-01, Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida\nOn March 26, 2018, YS Catering Holdings, Inc., et al., filed suit against Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. YS alleges claims against IVFH that are almost identical to ones pending in the PNC Bank vs. Fresh Diet, et al. federal court litigation (Case No. 17-cv-21027-KMM) in what we believe is an improper attempt at forum shopping. In addition, YS seeks injunctive relief with respect to the removal of certain trading restrictions and other restrictions on its restricted shares. IVFH intends to move to stay the case pending the outcome of the almost identical PNC federal court litigation involving YS's principal Zalmi Duchman. Discovery in the case is ongoing. While IVFH intends to vigorously defend against this lawsuit, the outcome of this lawsuit cannot ultimately be predicted.\n18. MAJOR CUSTOMER\nThe Company's largest customer, U.S. Foods, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 72% of total sales in each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. A contract between our subsidiary, Food Innovations, and U.S. Foods entered an optional renewal period in December 2012 but was automatically extended for an additional 12 months in each of January 1, 2013 and 2014. On January 26, 2015 we executed a contract between Food Innovations, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and U.S. Foods, Inc. The term of the contract is from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016 and provides for limited number of automatic annual renewals thereafter if no party gives the other 30 days' notice of its intent not to renew. Based on the terms, the Agreement was extended through December 31, 2018. Effective January 1, 2018 the Agreement was further amended to remove the cap on renewals, and provide for an unlimited number of additional 12-month terms unless either party notifies the other in writing, 30 days prior to the end date, of its intent not to renew.\nIndex\n19. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nOur short-term financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable and other liabilities, consist primarily of instruments without extended maturities, the fair value of which, based on management's estimates, reasonably approximate their book value. The fair value of the Company's stock option, convertible debt features and warrant instruments is determined using option pricing models.\nAs a result of the adoption of ASC 815-40, the Company is required to disclose the fair value measurements required by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.\u201d The other liabilities recorded at fair value in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2009 are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of December 31, 2017 to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, and summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and our disclosure controls and procedures are also effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting - Guidance for Smaller Public Companies issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013).\nSubject to the inherent limitations described in the following paragraph, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2017 at the reasonable assurance level.\nInherent Limitations Over Internal Controls\nInternal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly, our internal controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have made no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nIndex\nAttestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.

The employment agreements provide for salaries and benefits, including stock grants and extend up to five years. In addition to salary and benefit provisions, the agreements include defined commitments should the employer terminate the employee with or without cause.\nSAM KLEPFISH\nOn November 20, 2012 we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Klepfish, the Corporation's CEO, having an effective date of January 1, 2013 and terminating on December 31, 2015. The agreement provides a base compensation in the amount of $198,312 in cash plus an additional $27,937 in restricted stock units for year one, $223,987 in cash plus an additional $24,875 in restricted stock units for year two, and $260,075 in cash plus an additional $13,688 in restricted stock units for year three. The agreement also provides for annual bonuses including bonuses based on increases in EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) of our various subsidiaries; additional bonuses upon the occurrence of certain events such as: listing on specific stock exchanges, spin-offs, investments and stock trading and volume levels. The agreement also provides for stock options with exercise prices ranging from $0.40 - $1.60 and an award of restricted stock, which only vests if certain volume and pricing milestones with respect to our common stock are met. Mr. Klepfish also has the option of receiving any portion of his salary or bonus in the form of equity. The agreement also contains non-compete and non-solicitation provisions.\nOn August 7, 2014, our board of directors approved the amendment of the Employment Agreement with Mr. Klepfish effective as of August 13, 2014. The employment agreement was amended as follows: (i) it has been extended by one year to December 31, 2016; (ii) it provides for 10% annual increases of Base Salary commencing in 2014; (iii) certain performance based bonuses in the employment agreement are eliminated; (iv) stock grants previously issued with vesting based upon performance or stock price are cancelled; (v) a new performance based bonus structure to partially replace the previous structure, based upon meeting certain Cash EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and non-cash compensation charges) targets, the new bonus will have a cash portion and a stock portion and all Base Salary can be paid in cash or in stock at the option of Mr. Klepfish, and (vi) 125,00 restricted stock units which vest if the 30 day average closing price of our common stock is $2.00 or above and there is a 50,000 average daily volume or there is a 50,000 average daily volume for 14 straight trading days; and 175,000 restricted stock units which vest if the 30 day average closing price of our common stock is $3.00 or above and there is a 50,000 average daily volume for 14 straight trading days. Mr. Klepfish will have the option, on an annual basis, to take all or part of the cash portion of the bonus, or any part of Base Salary in the form of stock at a valuation based upon the closing stock price on the last trading day of the prior year. The decision on how much, if any, of the bonus to take in stock must be made by May 1 of each year, unless earlier required. The Cash EBITDA target levels do not include the effect of any potential future acquisitions and also do not include certain one time or non-recurring expenses in the calculation of the Cash EBITDA. If a Cash EBITDA target is missed by 3% or less, the bonus for the target so missed shall be reduced by 20% and if it is missed by 3.1% -5%, the bonus for such target shall be reduced by 30%, except in both cases, Mr. Klepfish has negative discretion to further reduce the bonuses or even cancel them.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, as well as all other related notes, and financial and operational references, appearing elsewhere in this document.\nCertain information contained in this discussion and elsewhere in this report may include forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and is subject to the safe harbor created by that act. The safe harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act will not apply to certain forward looking statements\u201d because we issued penny stock\u201d (as defined in Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 3(a)(51-1) under the Exchange Act) during the three year period preceding the date(s) on which those forward looking statements were first made, except to the extent otherwise specifically provided by rule, regulation or order of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We caution readers that certain important factors may affect our actual results and could cause such results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements which may be deemed to have been made in this Report or which are otherwise made by or on our behalf. For this purpose, any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as may\u201d, will\u201d, expect\u201d, believe\u201d, explore\u201d, consider\u201d, anticipate\u201d, intend\u201d, could\u201d, estimate\u201d, plan\u201d, propose\u201d or continue\u201d or the negative variations of those words or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that may affect our results include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties associated with:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Our ability to raise capital necessary to sustain our anticipated operations and implement our business plan,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Our ability to implement our business plan,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u25cf Our ability to generate sufficient cash to pay our lenders and other creditors, \nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Our dependence on one major customer,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Our ability to employ and retain qualified management and employees,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u25cf Our dependence on the efforts and abilities of our current employees and executive officers, \n \u25cf Changes in government regulations that are applicable to our current or anticipated business, \n \u25cf Changes in the demand for our services and different food trends, \n \u25cf The degree and nature of our competition, \n \u25cf The lack of diversification of our business plan, \n \u25cf The general volatility of the capital markets and the establishment of a market for our shares, and \n \u25cf Disruption in the economic and financial conditions primarily from the impact of past terrorist attacks in the United States, threats of future attacks, police and military activities overseas and other disruptive worldwide political and economic events and environmental weather conditions. \nWe are also subject to other risks detailed from time to time in our other filings with Securities and Exchange Commission and elsewhere in this report. Any one or more of these uncertainties, risks and other influences could materially affect our results of operations and whether forward-looking statements made by us ultimately prove to be accurate. Our actual results, performance and achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether from new information, future events or otherwise.\nIndex\nCritical Accounting Policy and Estimates\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates include certain assumptions related to doubtful accounts receivable, stock-based services, valuation of financial instruments, and income taxes. On an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Accounts subject to estimate and judgements are accounts receivable reserves, income taxes, intangible assets, contingent liabilities, and equity based instruments. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

The Company has an operational relationship of several years with our major customers, and we believe this experience provides us with a solid foundation from which to estimate our expected losses on accounts receivable. Should our sales mix change or if we develop new lines of business or new customers, these estimates and our estimation process will change accordingly. These estimates have been accurate in the past.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The estimated fair values approximate their carrying value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments or the stated interest rates are indicative of market interest rates. These fair values have historically varied due to the market price of the Company's stock at the date of valuation. Generally, these liabilities increased as the price of the Company's stock increased (with resultant gain), and decreased as the Company's stock decreased (yielding a loss). In December 2012, the Company removed these liabilities from its balance sheet by reclassifying them as equity.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has a history of losses, and as such has recorded no liability for income taxes. Until such time as the Company begins to provide evidence that a continued profit is a reasonable expectation, management will not determine that there is a basis for accruing an income tax liability. These estimates have been accurate in the past. At December 31, 2017, the Company has a net operating loss carryforward of $3,400,000.\nIndex\nBackground\nWe were initially formed in June 1979 as Alpha Solarco Inc., a Colorado corporation. From June 1979 through February 2003, we were either inactive or involved in discontinued business ventures. We changed our name to Fiber Application Systems Technology, Ltd in February 2003. In January 2004, we changed our state of incorporation by merging into Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. (IVFH), a Florida corporation formed for that purpose. As a result of the merger, we changed our name to that of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. In January 2004, we also acquired Food Innovations, Inc. ( FII\u201d or Food Innovations\u201d), a Delaware corporation, for 500,000 shares of our common stock.\nOn November 2, 2012, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Haley Acquisition\u201d) with The Haley Group, LLC whereby we acquired all existing assets of The Haley Group, LLC and its customers. The Haley Acquisition was valued at a total cost of $119,645. On June 30, 2014, pursuant to a purchase agreement, the Company purchased 100% of the membership interest of Organic Food Brokers, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company ( OFB\u201d), for $300,000, 100,000 4 year options at a price of $1.46 per share, and up to an additional $225,000 in earn-outs if certain milestones are met. Pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of January 1, 2017 the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Oasis Sales Corp. ( Oasis\u201d), purchased substantially all of the assets of Oasis Sales and Marketing, L.L.C. for $300,000 cash; a $200,000 structured equity instrument which can be paid in cash or shares of the Company stock at the Company's option, anytime under certain conditions, or is automatically payable via the issuance of 200,000 shares if the Company's shares close above $1.00 for ten consecutive days; a $100,000 note; and up to an additional $400,000 in earn-outs over two years if certain milestones are met. The Agreement also contains claw-back provisions if certain revenue conditions are not met.\nOn August 15, 2014, pursuant to a merger agreement (the Fresh Diet Merger Agreement\u201d), the Company acquired The Fresh Diet, Inc. ( The Fresh Diet\u201d or FD\u201d) through a reverse triangular merger as the registrant created a subsidiary corporation (FD Acquisition Corp) that merged with and into FD with FD being the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The purchase price consisted of 10,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock valued at $14,000,000. The majority of FD's current liabilities consisted of approximately $3.8 million of deferred revenues and approximately $2.1 million in short term commercial loans and there were additional ordinary course of business expenses such as trade payables, payroll and sales taxes which varied from month to month. In addition, it had some long term obligations the bulk of which consisted of interest free loans from FD's former shareholders in the amount of approximately $2.2 million which were not due for three years. Prior to the merger FD had purchased an immaterial amount of product from the Company. FD operated as an independent subsidiary subject to oversight of its board of directors and the Company's President and CEO. Effective February 23, 2016, the Company closed a transaction to sell 90% of our ownership in FD to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD who was appointed Interim CEO of FD on February 9, 2016. The consideration to Innovative Food Holdings consisted primarily of a restructuring of our loans, which includes the ability to convert to additional amounts of FD under certain circumstances. Aside from payments related to previously accrued liabilities there were no cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations.\nEffective January 24, 2018, pursuant to an asset acquisition agreement (the iGourmet Asset Acquisition Agreement\u201d), our wholly-owned subsidiary, Innovative Gourmet, LLC acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of iGourmet LLC and iGourmet NY LLC, privately-held New York limited liability companies located in West Pittston, Pennsylvania and engaged in the sale, marketing, and distribution of specialty food and specialty food items through www.igourmet.com, online marketplaces, additional direct-to-consumer platforms, distribution to foodservice, retail stores and other wholesale accounts, pursuant to the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement.\nTransactions With a Major Customer\nTransactions with a major customer and related economic dependence information is set forth (1) following our discussion of Liquidity and Capital Resources, (2) under the heading Major Customer in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and (3) in Business - Relationship with U.S. Foods, and (4) as the second item under Risk Factors.\nIndex\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPrior year balances have been recast to reflect the sale of 90% of our interest in FD in February 2016. Results of discontinued operations are excluded from the accompanying results of operations for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted. See Note 2 - discontinued operations in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nThis discussion may contain forward looking-statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our future results could differ materially from the forward looking-statements discussed in this report. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in the report.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by $6,072,329 or approximately 17.3% to $41,244,717 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $35,172,388 in the prior year.\nWe continue to assess the potential of new revenue sources from the manufacture and sale of proprietary food products, private label products and additional sales channel opportunities in both the foodservice and consumer space and will implement a strategy which based on our analysis provides the most beneficial opportunity for growth.\nAny changes in the food distribution and specialty foods operating landscape that materially hinders our current ability and/or cost to deliver our products to our customers could potentially cause a material impact on our net revenue and gross margin and, therefore, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nCurrently, a small portion of our revenues comes from imported products or international sales. Our current sales from such markets may be hampered and negatively impacted by any economic tariffs that may be imposed in the United States or in foreign countries.\nSee Transactions with Major Customers\u201d and the Securities and Exchange Commission's ( SEC\u201d) mandated FR-60 disclosures following the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section for a further discussion of the significant customer concentrations, loss of significant customer, critical accounting policies and estimates, and other factors that could affect future results.\nCost of goods sold\nOur cost of goods sold for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $27,619,026, an increase of $3,116,762 or approximately 12.7% compared to cost of goods sold of $24,502,264 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Cost of goods sold is made up of the following expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017: cost of goods of specialty, meat, game, cheese, seafood, poultry and other sales categories in the amount of $19,792,767; and shipping, delivery, handling, and purchase allowance expenses in the amount of $7,826,259. Total gross margin was approximately 33.1% of sales in 2017 compared to approximately 30.3% of sales in 2016. The increase in cost of goods sold is primary attributable to an increase in sales. The increase in gross margins from 2016 are primarily attributable to variation in product and revenue mix across our various selling channels.\nIn 2017, we continued to price our products in order to gain market share and increase the number of our end users. We were successful in both increasing sales and increasing market share. We currently expect, if market conditions and our product revenue mix remain constant, that our cost of goods sold may increase.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $1,566,375 or approximately 21.3% to $8,936,709 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7,370,334 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs of approximately $539,366 (net of a decrease in non-cash compensation in the amount of $504,873), and an increase in professional and legal costs in the amount of $564,653. The increase in payroll was due primarily to the acquisition of Oasis in January, 2017; the increase in legal and professional fees was due primarily to legal activities including legal and accounting expenses related the acquisition of certain assets of iGourmet LLC, and in addition, to other legal, litigation and accounting related expenses in 2017.\nIndex\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased by $323,665 or approximately 67.0% to $159,720 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $483,385 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in amortization of the discount on notes payable, which was $185,018 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $185,018 compared to $370,036 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. In addition, interest accrued or interest paid or accrued on the Company's commercial loans and notes payable decreased by $42,860 to $76,635 during the current period, compared to $119,495 during the prior year, and interest income increased by $9,698 to $15,844 during the current period compared to $6,146 during the prior year. The Company also had a reduction of interest as a result of negotiations with certain noteholders which resulted in a reduction of accrued interest in the amount of $86,089. Without this adjustment, and adding back interest income of $15,844, gross interest expense would have been $261,653 for the period.\nNet income from continuing operations\nFor the reasons above, the Company had net income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 of $4,529,262 which is an increase of approximately $1,712,857 or 60.8% compared to a net income of $2,816,405 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The income for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a total of $1,158,265 in non-cash charges, including amortization of intangible assets in the amount of $370,768, depreciation expense of $162,705, charges for non-cash compensation in the amount of $439,774, and amortization of the discount on notes payable in the amount of $185,018. The income for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a total of $1,837,094 in non-cash charges, including amortization of intangible assets in the amount of $232,768, depreciation expense of $158,143, charges for non-cash compensation in the amount of $1,076,147, and amortization of the discount on notes payable in the amount of $370,036.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources at December 31, 2017\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had current assets of $8,526,132, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $5,133,435; trade accounts receivable of $2,042,505; inventory of $937,962; notes receivable of $325,500; and other current assets of $86,730. Also at December 31, 2017, the Company had current liabilities of $2,399,274, consisting of trade payables and accrued liabilities of $1,836,559; accrued interest of $15,860; current portion of notes payable and capital leases of $346,855; and current portion of contingent liability of $200,000.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had cash provided by operating activities of $3,419,402. Cash flow from operations consisted of the Company's consolidated net income of $4,529,262 plus non-cash compensation in the amount of $439,774; non-cash amortization of discount on notes payable of $185,018; and depreciation and amortization of $533,473. The Company's cash position decreased by $2,268,125 as a result of changes in the components of current assets and current liabilities, primarily a reduction in accrued liabilities related to related to discontinued operations in the amount of $1,478,887.\nThe Company had cash used in investing activities of $675,345 for the year ended December 31, 2017, which consisted of cash paid in the acquisition of Oasis in the amount of $300,000, cash loaned to iGourmet LLC under a note agreement in the amount of $325,500; and cash paid for the acquisition of property and equipment in the amount of $49,845. The Company had cash used in financing activities of $1,374,675 for the year ended December 31, 2017, which consisted of principal payments made on notes payable of $997,544; principal payments on capital leases of $9,287, payments made for the purchase of treasury stock of $505,660; and payments made for the purchase of options from officers, directors, and employees of $163,925. The Company also received cash of $196,741 from the exercise of warrants for common stock, and $105,000 from the exercise of common stock options.\nThe Company had net working capital of $6,126,858 as of December 31, 2017. The Company had cash provided by operations during the year ended December 31, 2017 in the amount of $3,419,402; this amount is net of certain payments in the amount of $1,478,887 related to discontinued operations which relate mainly to a transaction to purchase the rights to 1,450,000 RSUs and 642,688 shares of the Company's common stock from a former FD employee which resulted in $850,000 in non-recurring cash payments. This compares to cash generated from operating activities of $3,469,096 during the year ended December 31, 2016. Without the cash flow items associated with discontinued operations, operating cash flow would have been $4,898,289 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company intends to continue to focus on increasing market share and cash flow from operations by focusing its sales activities on specific market segments and new product lines. Currently, we do not have any material long-term obligations other than those described in Note 13 to the financial statements included in this report. As we seek to increase our sales of new items and enter new markets, acquire new businesses as well as identify new and other consumer and food service oriented products and services, we may use existing cash reserves, long-term financing, or other means to finance such diversification.\nIndex\nIn February 2016, we completed the sale of FD to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD. See Note 3 to the accompanying financial statements.\nIf the Company's cash flow from operations is insufficient to fully implement its business plan, the Company may require additional financing in order to execute its operating plan. The Company cannot predict whether this additional financing will be in the form of equity or debt, or be in another form. The Company may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIn any of these events, the Company may be unable to implement its current plans for expansion, repay its debt obligations as they become due or respond to competitive pressures, any of which circumstances would have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n2018 Plans\nDuring 2018, in addition to our efforts to increase sales in our existing foodservice operations we plan to attempt to expand our business by expanding our focus to additional specialty foods markets in both the consumer and foodservice sector, exploring potential acquisition and partnership opportunities and continuing to extend our focus in the specialty food market through the growth of the Company's existing sales channels and through a variety of additional sales channel relationships which are currently being explored. In addition, we are currently exploring the introduction of a variety of new product categories and new product lines, including private label products and proprietary branded products to leverage our existing foodservice and consumer customer base.\nFurthermore, the Company intends to expand its activities in the direct to consumer space and the overall consumer packaged goods (CPG) space through leveraging the assets acquired from iGourmet LLC and through leveraging its overall capabilities in the consumer space.\nNo assurances can be given that any of these plans will come to fruition or that if implemented that they will necessarily yield positive results.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nInflation\nIn the opinion of management, inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of its operations.\nTransactions with Major Customers\nThe Company's largest customer, US Foods, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 72% of total sales in each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. A contract between our subsidiary, Food Innovations, and USF entered an optional renewal period in December 2012 but was automatically extended for an additional 12 months in each of January 1, 2013 and 2014. On January 26, 2015 we executed a contract between Food Innovations, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and U.S. Foods, Inc. The term of the Agreement is from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016 and provides for a limited number of automatic annual renewals thereafter if no party gives the other 30 days' notice of its intent not to renew. Based on the terms, the Agreement was extended through 2018. Effective January 1, 2018 the Agreement was further amended to remove the cap on renewals, and provide for an unlimited number of additional 12-month terms unless either party notifies the other in writing, 30 days prior to the end date, of its intent not to renew.\nIndex\nITEM 8. Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nInnovative Food Holdings, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., and subsidiaries (the Company\u201d) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ( PCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Liggett & Webb, P.A.\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.\nNew York, NY\nMarch 29, 2018\nIndex\nInnovative

Overall, our focus is on distribution or the enabling of distribution of specialty food products ranging from specialty foodservice products to Consumer Packaged Goods ( CPG\u201d) products Since its incorporation, the Company primarily through FII's relationship with the producers, growers, and makers of thousands of unique specialty foodservice products and through its relationship with US Foods, Inc.

As a result of the sale, the results of operations for all periods have been included in Net income from discontinued operations\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations. See Note 3 - Discontinued Operations for additional information.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Accounts subject to estimate and judgements are accounts receivable reserves, income taxes, intangible assets, contingent liabilities, and equity based instruments. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe our estimates have not been materially inaccurate in past years, and our assumptions are not likely to change in the foreseeable future.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Artisan, Food Innovations, FNM, OFB, GFG, Gourmet Foodservice Warehouse, Inc., Gourmeting, Inc., Haley, Innovative Gourmet, Food Funding, and Gourmet. All accounts of FD have been included under discontinued operations. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation of these entities.\nIndex\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue upon product delivery. All of our products are shipped either same day or overnight or through longer shipping terms to the customer and the customer takes title to product and assumes risk and ownership of the product when it is delivered. Shipping charges to customers and sales taxes collectible from customers, if any, are included in revenues.\nFor revenue from product sales, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB\u201d Accounting Standards Codification ASC\u201d 605-15-05. ASC 605-15-05 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company defers any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.\nCost of goods sold\nWe have included in cost of goods sold all costs which are directly related to the generation of revenue. These costs include primarily the cost of food and raw materials, packing and handling, shipping, and delivery costs.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nWe have included in selling, general, and administrative expenses all other costs which support the Company's operations but which are not includable as a cost of sales. These include primarily payroll, facility costs such as rent and utilities, selling expenses such as commissions and advertising, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation, and other administrative costs including professional fees and costs associated with non-cash stock compensation. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents include all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less which are not securing any corporate obligations.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company's estimate is based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable. It is reasonably possible that the Company's estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change. Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $63,267 and $8,123 at December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are valued at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives up to five years using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nThe estimated service lives of property and equipment are as follows:\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> Computer Equipment\n</td> <td> 3 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Warehouse Equipment\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Office Furniture and Fixtures\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vehicles\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInventories\nInventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and is determined by the first-in, first-out method.\nIndex\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets, including tax loss and credit carryforwards, and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amount of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable, line of credit, accounts payable and accrued expenses, none of which is held for trading, approximates their estimated fair values due to the short-term maturities of those financial instruments.\nThe Company adopted ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements\u201d (SFAS 157), which provides a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its property and equipment and any identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The test for impairment is required to be performed by management at least annually. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted operating cash flow expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nComprehensive Income\nASC 220-10-15 Reporting Comprehensive Income,\u201d establishes standards for reporting and displaying of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, ASC 220-10-15 requires that all items that are required to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. The Company does not have any items of comprehensive income in any of the periods presented.\nCost Method Investments\nThe Company has made several investments in early stage private food related companies and are accounting for these investments under the cost method.\nBasic and Diluted Income Per Share\nBasic net earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, while fully-diluted net earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive securities assumed to be outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive securities consist of options and warrants to purchase common stock, and convertible debt. Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.\nThe Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of outstanding stock options and warrants. Stock options and warrants for which the exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per common share and, accordingly, are excluded from the calculation.\nIndex\nDilutive shares at December 31, 2017:\nConvertible notes and interest\nAt Dec 31, 2017 the Company there are no convertible notes outstanding.\nWarrants\nAt Dec 31, 2017 there are no warrants outstanding.\nStock Options\nThe following table summarizes the options outstanding and the related prices for the options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock issued by the Company:\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Weighted\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Remaining\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exercise\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Number\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Contractual\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Price\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> of Options\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Life (years)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.57\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.02\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.04\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 200,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.83\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.31\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 200,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.50\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.38\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.92\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.42\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.47\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.43\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.00\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.46\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.50\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.60\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 310,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.01\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.70\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 75,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.28\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.90\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 175,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.48\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.00\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.28\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.40\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.41\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.50\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 37,500\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.28\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.40\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 30,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.41\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.50\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 37,500\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.28\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,510,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.89\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company is also committed to issue a total of 115,941 shares pursuant to the cashless conversion of an aggregate 500,000 options consisting of 300,000 options at a price of $0.35 per share, and 200,000 options at a price of $0.57 per share, The shares, which the Company intends to issue in April 2018, represent a net amount after aggregate cash payments of $167,000, which was a portion of the difference between the exercise price of the options and the market price of the stock on the date of purchase, and taxes.\nRSUs\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company cancelled all outstanding restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) and replaced them with common stock or restricted stock awards; see note 16.\nAt December 31, 2017, there are no RSUs outstanding.\nWe recognized stock-based compensation expense for RSUs in a straight-line manner over the vesting period of the grant. This resulted in stock-based compensation expense of $0 and $658,709 related to recognition of RSUs during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company cancelled unvested RSUs representing 1,370,000 shares of common stock and replaced them with restricted stock awards also representing 1,370,000 shares of common stock. The restricted stock awards vested over the same vesting period and under the same terms as the RSUs they replaced. Restricted stock awards representing 1,070,000 shares were vested at December 31, 2017; there are a total of 300,000 unvested restricted stock awards remaining. Those 300,000 restricted stock awards will vest as follows: 125,000 restricted stock awards will vest contingent upon the attainment of a stock price of $2.00 per share for 20 straight trading days, and an additional 175,000 restricted stock awards will vest contingent upon the attainment of a stock price of $3.00 per share for 20 straight trading days. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized expense of $240,208 for the vesting of restricted stock awards, the same amount of expense that would have been recognized had the RSUs not been replaced by the restricted stock awards. As the restricted stock awards were not in place during the year ended December 31, 2016, there was no such cost during that period.\nIndex\nDilutive shares at December 31, 2016:\nConvertible notes and interest\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding convertible notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of $647,565 with accrued interest of $626,873 convertible at the rate of $0.25 per share into an aggregate 5,097,752 shares of common stock. These notes were issued mainly as part of a debt financing into the Company in 2004 and have certain restrictions on repayment. The Company also has a note payable to a related party in the amount of $164,650 convertible at the rate of $0.25 per share into an aggregate of 658,600 shares of common stock.\nWarrants\nAlso at December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding warrants for holders to purchase the following additional shares: The following warrants were issued in connection to a 2004 equity investment into the Company: 2,294,493 shares exercisable at a price of $0.575 per share; 448,010 shares exercisable at a price of $0.55 per share; and 94,783 shares exercisable at a price of $0.25 per share. In addition the Company has 700,000 warrants outstanding exercisable at a price of $0.01 per share. These warrants were originally issued in connection with the issuance of a loan connected to the Artisan Specialty Foods acquisition. 800,000 of the original warrants were cancelled upon the early payment of the loan in 2012, leaving the current 700,000 connected to the Artisan loan previously outstanding.\nStock options\nThe following table summarizes the options outstanding and the related prices for the options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock issued by the Company at December 31, 2016:\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Weighted\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Remaining\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exercise\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Number of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Contractual\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prices\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Options\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Life (years)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.350\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,170,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.17\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.380\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92,500\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.50\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.400\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 275,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.51\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.450\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92,500\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.50\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.474\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92,500\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.50\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.480\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92,500\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.50\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.570\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 225,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.51\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.310\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 75,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.17\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.440\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.34\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.460\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.00\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.600\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 310,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.51\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.900\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.34\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 500,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.67\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.400\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.92\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.400\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 30,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.92\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,105,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.07\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRSUs\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company has issued restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) for the potential issuance of shares of the Company's common stock for the purpose of aligning executives and employees of the Company and for the purpose of compensation for serving as members of the Board of Directors of the Company and for the purposes of retaining qualified personnel at compensation levels that otherwise would not be available should the company have been required to pay certain salaries in cash only. Certain RSUs were issued to the executive officers of the Company ( Executive RSUs\u201d); certain RSUs were issued to the employees of the Company ( Employee RSUs\u201d); certain RSUs were issued to members of the board of directors of the Company ( Board RSUs\u201d); and certain of the RSUs were issued to employees of FD ( FD RSUs\u201d).\nIndex\nAt December 31, 2016, the following Executive RSUs were outstanding: A total of 1,737,072 RSUs were vested, and 800,000 will vest on July 1, 2017. An additional 125,000 RSUs will vest contingent upon the attainment of a stock price of $2.00 per share for 20 straight trading days, and an additional 175,000 RSUs will vest contingent upon the attainment of a stock price of $3.00 per share for 20 straight trading days. The Company estimated that the stock-price goals of the Company's stock price closing above $2.00 per share for 20 straight days have a 90% likelihood of achievement, and these RSUs were valued at 90% of their face value; the Company also estimated that the likelihood of the Company's stock closing above $3.00 per share for 20 straight days is 70%, and these RSUs were valued at 70% of their face value. We recognized stock-based compensation expense of in a straight-line manner over the vesting period of the RSUs.\nOn March 31, 2016, 10,000 Board RSUs were issued. On August 3, 2016, 95,000 Board RSUs were exercised by a former Board member. At December 31, 2016, the following Board RSUs were outstanding: a total of 545,000 RSUs were vested, and 270,000 vest on July 1, 2017.\nThe Employee RSUs were issued to certain nonexecutive employees of the Company either partially in lieu of salary, future bonuses or a combination of both bonus and salary. On March 31, 2016, 180,534 Employee RSUs were issued. At December 31, 2016, 180,534 Employee RSUs were outstanding, all of which were vested.\nOn January 26, 2016, 300,000 FD RSUs were exercised, and 800,000 FD RSUs were forfeited. On April 25, 2016, an additional 1,000,000 FD RSUs were forfeited. On June 29, 2016, 200,000 FD RSUs were exercised, and an additional 900,000 FD RSUs were forfeited. At December 31, 2016, 1,000,000 FD RSUs were outstanding; 600,000 were vested, and 400,000 were scheduled to vest on July 1, 2017.\nWe recognized stock-based compensation expense for RSUs in a straight-line manner over the vesting period of the grant. This resulted in stock-based compensation expense of $1,663,309 (including $813,908 charged to discontinued operations) and $4,206,282 (including $2,258,216 charged to discontinued operations) related to recognition of RSUs during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments and related items, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Company places its cash and temporary cash in investments with credit quality institutions. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had cash deposits in excess of applicable government mandated insurance limits in the amount of $3,470,000 and $2,971,942, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, trade receivables from the Company's largest customer amounted to 48% and 44%, respectively, of total trade receivables.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the use of assumptions, including the expected term of the award and the expected stock price volatility. We used the Company's historical volatility to estimate expected stock price volatility. The risk-free rate assumption was based on United States Treasury instruments whose terms were consistent with the expected term of the stock option. The expected dividend assumption was based on the Company's history and expectation of dividend payouts.\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) were measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. RSUs awarded may be conditional upon the attainment of one or more performance objectives over a specified period. At the end of the performance period, if the goals are attained, the awards are granted. Stock-based compensation expense was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and was reduced for estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates. The estimated annual forfeiture rates for stock options and RSUs are based on the Company's historical forfeiture experience. The estimated fair value of stock options and RSUs is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting term of the grant. Compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period based on management's best estimate as to whether it is probable that the shares awarded are expected to vest. Management assesses the probability of the performance milestones being met on a continuous basis.\nIndex\nOptions expense during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized in the table below:\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Option expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,847\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,752\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRSUs expense during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized in the table below:\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RSUs expense - Continuing operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 849,401\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RSUs expense - Discontinued operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 813,908\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,663,309\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to conform prior period data to the current presentation.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Stock Compensation - Scope of Modification Accounting, which provides guidance on which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The ASU requires that an entity should account for the effects of a modification unless the fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if used), vesting conditions and classification (as equity or liability) of the modified award are all the same as for the original award immediately before the modification. The ASU becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, and should be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company will apply this standard for any awards that are modified after January 1, 2018. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, current U.S. GAAP requires the performance of procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, the amendments under this ASU require the goodwill impairment test to be performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The ASU becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 which amends ASC Topic 230, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.\u201d The amendments in this update address eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The update outlines the classification of specific transactions as either cash inflows or outflows from financing activities, operating activities, investing activities or non-cash activities. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either operating or financing, with such classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and associated disclosures.\nIndex\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), to clarify the principles of recognizing revenue and create common revenue recognition guidance between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Under ASU 2014-09, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for such goods or services. In addition, ASU 2014-09 requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The new revenue standard is principle based and interpretation of those principles may vary from company to company based on their unique circumstances. It is possible that interpretation, industry practice, and guidance may evolve as companies and the accounting profession work to implement this new standard. The Company is still in the process of evaluating the effect of the new standard on the Company's historical financial statements and disclosures. While the Company has not completed its evaluation, the Company currently believes that the impact to revenue and expense recognized will not be material to any of the years presented.\nManagement does not believe that any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\n2. ACQUISITION\nPursuant to the Oasis Asset Purchase Agreement, effective January 1, 2017, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Oasis Sales Corp., purchased certain assets of Oasis Sales and Marketing, L.L.C., a California limited liability company. The purchase price consisted of $300,000 cash; a two-year promissory note in the amount of $100,000, and a structured equity instrument (the SEI\u201d) in the amount of $200,000. In addition, the Company is contingently liable for certain performance-based payments over the twenty-four months following the acquisition date up to a maximum of $400,000 ( Earnout Payments\u201d). Of this amount, $200,000 was carried as a current liability, and $200,000 was carried as a long-term liability on the Company's balance sheet at December 31, 2017.\nThe SEI was payable in cash or shares of the Company's stock at the Company's option, at any time, or is automatically payable via the issuance of 200,000 shares of the Company's stock if the Company's shares close above $1.00 for ten consecutive days. This requirement was met on November 28, 2017, and on that date the $200,000 SEI liability was converted to 200,000 shares of common stock.\nThe Company believes it is likely that the Earnout Payments will be made, and accordingly has recorded the entire amount of $400,000 as a contingent liability on its balance sheet as of the acquisition date. The amount of $800,000 was allocated to customer lists, an intangible asset with a useful life of 60 months; and the amount of $200,000 was allocated to a non-compete agreement, an intangible asset with a useful life of 48 months. A total of $210,000 was amortized to operations during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nEffective February 23, 2016, the Company closed a transaction to sell 90% of our ownership in The Fresh Diet, Inc. ( FD\u201d) to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD who was appointed Interim CEO of FD on February 9 , 2016 . The consideration to Innovative Food Holdings consisted primarily of a restructuring of our loans, which includes the ability to convert to additional amounts of FD under certain circumstances. There is no continuing cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company accrued the amount of $850,000 representing the amount due based on an agreement signed in 2017. The agreement involved the purchase of rights to 1,450,000 RSUs and the purchase of 642,688 shares of the Company's common stock (see note 16).\nASC 360-10-45-9 requires that a long-lived asset (disposal group) to be sold shall be classified as held for sale in the period in which a set of criteria have been met, including criteria that the sale of the asset (disposal group) is probable and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. This criteria was achieved on February 9, 2016. Additionally, the discontinued operations are comprised of the entirety of FD, excluding corporate services expenses. Lastly, for comparability purposes certain prior period line items relating to the assets held for sale have been reclassified and presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nIndex\nThe following information presents the major classes of line items constituting the

NOTES RECEIVABLE\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary Food Funding, LLC loaned the amount of $325,500 to iGourmet, LLC pursuant to a note agreement (the iGourmet Note Receivable\u201d). The iGourmet LLC Note Receivable bears interest at the rate of 9% per annum, and is due April 1, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded interest income in the amount of $5,238 in the iGourmet Note Receivable. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of iGourmet LLC; see Note 20.\n7. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nAcquisition of Building\nThe Company owns a building and property located at 28411 Race Track Road, Bonita Springs, Florida 34135. The property consists of approximately 1.1 acres of land and approximately 10,000 square feet of combined office and warehouse space, and was purchased as part of a bank short sale. The Company moved its operations to these premises on July 15, 2013. The purchase price of the property was $792,758.\nOn May 14, 2015, the Company purchased a building and property located at 2528 S. 27th Avenue, Broadview, Illinois 60155. The property consists of approximately 1.33 acres of land and approximately 28,711 square feet of combined office and warehouse space. The purchase price of $914,350 was initially financed primarily by a draw-down of $900,000 on the Company's credit facility with Fifth Third Bank. On May 29, 2015, a permanent financing facility was provided by Fifth Third Bank in the form of a loan in the amount of $980,000. $900,000 of this amount was used to pay the balance of the credit facility; the additional $80,000 was used for refrigeration and other improvements at the property. The interest on the loan is at the LIBOR rate plus 3.0%. The building is used for office and warehouse space for the Company's Artisan subsidiary. Depreciation on the building and the related improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment began when the Company occupied the facility in October, 2015.\nA summary of property and equipment at December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 385,523\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 385,523\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Building\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,326,165\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,326,165\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Computer and Office Equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 497,189\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 466,177\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Warehouse Equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 226,953\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 226,953\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Furniture and Fixtures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 473,572\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 454,743\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vehicles\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 40,064\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 40,064\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total before accumulated depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,949,466\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,899,625\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: accumulated depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (994,216\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (831,515\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,955,250\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,068,110\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndex\nDepreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment amounted to $162,705 and $158,143 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n8. INVESTMENTS\nThe Company has made investments in certain early stage food related companies which it expects can benefit from synergies with the Company's various operating businesses. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company acquired a 5.81% equity interest in a food related company for the amount of $51,525, consisting of the conversion to equity of a loan receivable from the investee in the amount $10,863 and the conversion of trade receivable from the investee in the amount of $40,662. At December 31, 2017, the Company has investments in three food related companies in the aggregate amount of $201,525.

As detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for goodwill impairment, management has completed a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. To complete this review, management followed the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair value of goodwill and considered all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of goodwill. The analysis completed in 2017 and 2016 determined that there was no impairment to goodwill assets related to the Artisan and Haley transactions.\n10.

INCOME TAXES\nDeferred income taxes result from the temporary differences primarily attributable to amortization of intangible assets and debt discount and an accumulation of net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes with a valuation allowance against the carryforwards for book purposes.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Included in deferred tax assets are Federal and State net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $3,400,000, which will expire through 2037. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Due to significant changes in the Company's ownership, the Company's future use of its existing net operating losses may be limited.\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 consist of the following:\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable statutory income tax rate of 39.6% for the December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, to the loss before taxes as a result of the following differences:\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,529,262\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,816,405\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Statutory tax rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 39.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 39.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total tax at statutory rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,794,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,115,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Temporary differences\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 255,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 235,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permanent differences - restructuring\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,070,500\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permanent difference - meals and entertainment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permanent differences- non cash compensation, and discount amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 256,700\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 463,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,311,700\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,252,500\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in valuation allowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,311,700\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,252,500\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeferred income taxes reflect the tax impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations.\nDeferred income taxes include the net tax effects of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

The Tax Act establishes new tax laws that affect 2018 and future years, including a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. For certain deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, we have recorded a provisional decrease of $388,000, with a corresponding net adjustment to valuation allowance of $388,000 as of December 31, 2017.\n16.

These 1,070,000 shares were issued during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The vesting for the remaining 300,000 restricted stock awards is contingent upon meeting certain price and volume conditions related to the Company's stock; these conditions are the same conditions required for vesting of the cancelled RSUs.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nContingent Liability\nPursuant to the Oasis acquisition, the Company was contingently liable for certain performance-based payments over the twenty-four months following the acquisition date. At December 31, 2017, the Company carried the amount of $200,000 on its balance sheet as contingent liability - current, and an additional $200,000 as contingent liability - long term. See notes 2 and 16.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, the Company has become and may become involved in certain lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business, or as the result of current or previous investments, or current or previous subsidiaries, or current or previous employees, or current or previous directors, or as a result of acquisitions and dispositions or other corporate activities. The Company intends to vigorously defend its positions. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our financial position or our business and the outcome of these matters cannot be ultimately predicted.\nPNC Bank, National Association v. The Fresh Diet, Inc. f/k/a YS Catering, LLP f/k/a YS Catering, Inc., et al. / Scher Zalman Duchman and Deborah L. Duchman v. Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 17-cv-21027-KMM, United States District Court, Southern District of Florida\nOn July 7, 2017, Scher Zalman Duchman and Deborah L. Duchman (collectively, Duchmans\u201d) filed an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida seeking approximately $1 million in damages against Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., FD Acquisition Corp., and Sam Klepfish, IVFH's CEO. The Duchmans, amongst other things, allege that defendants owed a fiduciary duty to the Duchmans to minimize the Duchmans' own personal guarantees and personal obligations related to loans and other obligations incurred by a former subsidiary of the Company and that the Defendants did not fulfill that alleged fiduciary obligation. By Order dated March 22, 2018, the following causes of action were dismissed without prejudice: Count I, Breach of Fiduciary Duty; Count III, Unjust Enrichment; Count IV, Unjust Enrichment; and Count IX, Fraud in the Inducement. The Court further ordered Count XI, Punitive Damages, stricken from the Complaint and that all claims against Third Party Defendant FD Acquisition Corp. dismissed with prejudice. Discovery is ongoing, and IVFH will soon be filing a motion for summary judgment. The parties have scheduled required mediation. The court has provided a scheduled trial date. IVFH believes that this lawsuit is without merit and is an attempt by the Duchmans to drag IVFH into the Duchmans' personal financial matters which are unrelated to IVFH. While IVFH intends to vigorously defend against this lawsuit, the outcome of this lawsuit cannot ultimately be predicted.\nYS Catering Holdings, Inc., et al. vs. Attollo Partners LLC, Rajesh Rawal, Vojkan Dimitijevic, Asif Syed, Roy Heggland and Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., Case No. 2017-007504-CA-01, Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida\nOn March 26, 2018, YS Catering Holdings, Inc., et al., filed suit against Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. YS alleges claims against IVFH that are almost identical to ones pending in the PNC Bank vs. Fresh Diet, et al. federal court litigation (Case No. 17-cv-21027-KMM) in what we believe is an improper attempt at forum shopping. In addition, YS seeks injunctive relief with respect to the removal of certain trading restrictions and other restrictions on its restricted shares. IVFH intends to move to stay the case pending the outcome of the almost identical PNC federal court litigation involving YS's principal Zalmi Duchman. Discovery in the case is ongoing. While IVFH intends to vigorously defend against this lawsuit, the outcome of this lawsuit cannot ultimately be predicted.\n18. MAJOR CUSTOMER\nThe Company's largest customer, U.S. Foods, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 72% of total sales in each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. A contract between our subsidiary, Food Innovations, and U.S. Foods entered an optional renewal period in December 2012 but was automatically extended for an additional 12 months in each of January 1, 2013 and 2014. On January 26, 2015 we executed a contract between Food Innovations, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and U.S. Foods, Inc. The term of the contract is from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016 and provides for limited number of automatic annual renewals thereafter if no party gives the other 30 days' notice of its intent not to renew. Based on the terms, the Agreement was extended through December 31, 2018. Effective January 1, 2018 the Agreement was further amended to remove the cap on renewals, and provide for an unlimited number of additional 12-month terms unless either party notifies the other in writing, 30 days prior to the end date, of its intent not to renew.\nIndex\n19. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nOur short-term financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable and other liabilities, consist primarily of instruments without extended maturities, the fair value of which, based on management's estimates, reasonably approximate their book value. The fair value of the Company's stock option, convertible debt features and warrant instruments is determined using option pricing models.\nAs a result of the adoption of ASC 815-40, the Company is required to disclose the fair value measurements required by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.\u201d The other liabilities recorded at fair value in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2009 are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Hierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuations of these liabilities are as follows:\n Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date; Level 2 - In15puts other than Level 1 inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3 - Unobservable inputs, for which little or no market data exist, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. \nAs December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not have financial assets or liabilities that are required to be accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.\n20. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nAsset Acquisition - iGourmet, LLC\nEffective January 24, 2018, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Innovative Gourmet, acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of iGourmet LLC and iGourmet NY LLC ( Sellers\u201d), privately-held New York limited liability companies operating out of Pennsylvania and engaged in the sale, marketing, and distribution of specialty food and specialty food items through www.igourmet.com, online marketplaces, additional direct-to-consumer platforms, distribution to foodservice, retail stores and other wholesale accounts, pursuant to the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement (the APA\u201d).\nThe consideration for and in connection with the acquisition consisted of: (i) $1,500,000, which satisfied or reduced secured, priority and administrative debt of Sellers; (ii) in connection with and prior to the acquisition, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Food Funding, funded advances of $325,000 to Sellers on a secured basis, pursuant to certain loan documents and as bridge loans, which loans were reduced by the proceeds of the APA; (iii) the purchase for $200,000 of certain debt owed by Sellers, to be paid out of, if available, Innovative Gourmet's cash flow; (iv) potential contingent liability allocation for a percentage of Sellers' approximately $2,300,000 of certain debt, not purchased or assumed by Innovative Gourmet, which under certain circumstances, Innovative Gourmet may determine to pay; and (v) additional purchase price consideration of (a) up to a maximum of $1,500,000, if EBITDA of Innovative Gourmet reaches $3,800,000 million in 2018, (b) up to a maximum of $1,750,000, if EBITDA of Innovative Gourmet in 2019 exceeds its EBITDA in 2018 by at least 20% and if its EBITDA reaches $5,000,000; and (c) up to a maximum of $2,125,000, if EBITDA of Innovative Gourmet in 2020 exceeds its EBITDA in 2019 by at least 20% and if its EBITDA reaches $8,000,000. The EBITDA based earnout shall be paid 37.5% in cash, 25% in Innovative Food Holdings shares valued at the time of the closing of this transaction and 37.5%, at Innovative Gourmet's option, in Innovative Food Holdings shares valued at the time of the payment of the earnout or in cash.\nIn connection with the acquisition, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Food Funding, purchased Seller's senior secured note at a price of approximately $1,187,000, pursuant to the terms of a Loan Sale Agreement with UPS Capital Business Credit. That note was reduced by the proceeds of the APA as disclosed in (i) above.\nRestated Loan Agreement\nOn March 23, 2018 and effective February 26, 2018, we entered into a Fifth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement with Fifth Third Bank, an Ohio banking corporation ( Lender\u201d), to, among other things, reduce the amount of an existing loan to Two Hundred Seventy Three Thousand Dollars and extend its due date to February 28, 2023 and enter into a new term loan in the amount of One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars due on August 28, 2019 carrying interest at LIBOR plus 4.25%. We also entered into an equipment loan with Lender in the amount of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars due March 31, 2019 carrying interest at LIBOR plus 2.75%. All of these loans continue to be secured by the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nIndex\nExercise of Options\nIn January 2018, the Company issued 100,000 shares of common stock to a former board member for the exercise of options at a price of $0.35 per share.\nIn December 2017, the Company's Chief Executive Officer exercised 100,000 options at a price of $0.35 per share and an additional 100,000 options at a price of $0.57 per share. The date for payment of the exercise price of these options was extended to April 26, 2018. 55,192 shares of common stock will be issued in April 2018, which number of shares represents a net amount after a cash payment of $45,000 which was a portion of the difference between the exercise price of the options and the market price of the stock on the date of purchase, and taxes.\nIn December 2017, the Company's President exercised 100,000 options at a price of $0.35 per share and an additional 100,000 options at a price of $0.57 per share. The date for payment of the exercise price of these options was extended to April 26, 2018. 60,749 shares of common stock will be issued in April 2018, which number of shares represents a net amount after a cash payment of $45,000 made in March 2018 which was a portion of the difference between the exercise price of the options and the market price of the stock on the date of purchase, and taxes.\nIn December 2017, a Board Member exercised 100,000 options at a price of $0.35 per share. The date for payment of the exercise price of these options was extended to April 26, 2018. In March 2018 the Company made a payment of $77,000 which is the difference between the exercise price of the options and the market price of the stock on the date of purchase.\nAmendment of Bylaws\nIn January 2018, Pursuant to the authority granted by Article XII of our Bylaws, Article III, Section 11 of the Bylaws was amended to permit the Board of Directors to remove, with or without cause, a director appointed by the Board of Directors by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors.\nDirector Resignation\nIn January 2018, Mr. Nathaniel Klein voluntarily resigned from our Board of Directors. Prior to his resignation, Mr. Klein was a member of the Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees.\nContingent Liability - Oasis Acquisition\nIn January 2018, the Company paid the amount of $200,000 to satisfy a performance-based contingent liability related to the Oasis acquisition; see notes 2 and 16.\nIndex\nITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of December 31, 2017 to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, and summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and our disclosure controls and procedures are also effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting - Guidance for Smaller Public Companies issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013).\nSubject to the inherent limitations described in the following paragraph, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2017 at the reasonable assurance level.\nInherent Limitations Over Internal Controls\nInternal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly, our internal controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have made no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nIndex\nAttestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 9B.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, as well as all other related notes, and financial and operational references, appearing elsewhere in this document.\nCertain information contained in this discussion and elsewhere in this report may include forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and is subject to the safe harbor created by that act. The safe harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act will not apply to certain forward looking statements\u201d because we issued penny stock\u201d (as defined in Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 3(a)(51-1) under the Exchange Act) during the three year period preceding the date(s) on which those forward looking statements were first made, except to the extent otherwise specifically provided by rule, regulation or order of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We caution readers that certain important factors may affect our actual results and could cause such results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements which may be deemed to have been made in this Report or which are otherwise made by or on our behalf. For this purpose, any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as may\u201d, will\u201d, expect\u201d, believe\u201d, explore\u201d, consider\u201d, anticipate\u201d, intend\u201d, could\u201d, estimate\u201d, plan\u201d, propose\u201d or continue\u201d or the negative variations of those words or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that may affect our results include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties associated with:\n\n \u25cf Our ability to generate sufficient cash to pay our lenders and other creditors, \n\n \u25cf Our dependence on the efforts and abilities of our current employees and executive officers, \n \u25cf Changes in government regulations that are applicable to our current or anticipated business, \n \u25cf Changes in the demand for our services and different food trends, \n \u25cf The degree and nature of our competition, \n \u25cf The lack of diversification of our business plan, \n \u25cf The general volatility of the capital markets and the establishment of a market for our shares, and \n \u25cf Disruption in the economic and financial conditions primarily from the impact of past terrorist attacks in the United States, threats of future attacks, police and military activities overseas and other disruptive worldwide political and economic events and environmental weather conditions. \nWe are also subject to other risks detailed from time to time in our other filings with Securities and Exchange Commission and elsewhere in this report. Any one or more of these uncertainties, risks and other influences could materially affect our results of operations and whether forward-looking statements made by us ultimately prove to be accurate. Our actual results, performance and achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether from new information, future events or otherwise.\nIndex\nCritical Accounting Policy and Estimates\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates include certain assumptions related to doubtful accounts receivable, stock-based services, valuation of financial instruments, and income taxes. On an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Accounts subject to estimate and judgements are accounts receivable reserves, income taxes, intangible assets, contingent liabilities, and equity based instruments. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe our estimates have not been materially inaccurate in past years, and our assumptions are not likely to change in the foreseeable future.\n(a) Warrants:\nThe following table illustrates certain key information regarding our warrants and warrant valuation assumptions at December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\n(b) Embedded conversion features of notes payable:\nThe following table illustrates certain key information regarding our Conversion options and conversion option valuation assumptions at December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nIndex\n(c) Stock options:\nThe Company accounts for options in accordance with FASB ASC 718-40. Options are valued upon issuance utilizing the Black-Scholes valuation model. Option expense is recognized over the requisite service period of the related option award. The following table illustrates certain key information regarding our options and option assumptions at December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nDoubtful Accounts Receivable\nThe Company maintained an allowance in the amount of $63,267 for doubtful accounts receivable at December 31, 2017, and $8,123 at December 31, 2016. The Company has an operational relationship of several years with our major customers, and we believe this experience provides us with a solid foundation from which to estimate our expected losses on accounts receivable. Should our sales mix change or if we develop new lines of business or new customers, these estimates and our estimation process will change accordingly. These estimates have been accurate in the past.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The estimated fair values approximate their carrying value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments or the stated interest rates are indicative of market interest rates. These fair values have historically varied due to the market price of the Company's stock at the date of valuation. Generally, these liabilities increased as the price of the Company's stock increased (with resultant gain), and decreased as the Company's stock decreased (yielding a loss). In December 2012, the Company removed these liabilities from its balance sheet by reclassifying them as equity.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has a history of losses, and as such has recorded no liability for income taxes. Until such time as the Company begins to provide evidence that a continued profit is a reasonable expectation, management will not determine that there is a basis for accruing an income tax liability. These estimates have been accurate in the past. At December 31, 2017, the Company has a net operating loss carryforward of $3,400,000.\nIndex\nBackground\nWe were initially formed in June 1979 as Alpha Solarco Inc., a Colorado corporation. From June 1979 through February 2003, we were either inactive or involved in discontinued business ventures. We changed our name to Fiber Application Systems Technology, Ltd in February 2003. In January 2004, we changed our state of incorporation by merging into Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. (IVFH), a Florida corporation formed for that purpose. As a result of the merger, we changed our name to that of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. In January 2004, we also acquired Food Innovations, Inc. ( FII\u201d or Food Innovations\u201d), a Delaware corporation, for 500,000 shares of our common stock.\nOn November 2, 2012, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Haley Acquisition\u201d) with The Haley Group, LLC whereby we acquired all existing assets of The Haley Group, LLC and its customers. The Haley Acquisition was valued at a total cost of $119,645. On June 30, 2014, pursuant to a purchase agreement, the Company purchased 100% of the membership interest of Organic Food Brokers, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company ( OFB\u201d), for $300,000, 100,000 4 year options at a price of $1.46 per share, and up to an additional $225,000 in earn-outs if certain milestones are met. Pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of January 1, 2017 the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Oasis Sales Corp. ( Oasis\u201d), purchased substantially all of the assets of Oasis Sales and Marketing, L.L.C. for $300,000 cash; a $200,000 structured equity instrument which can be paid in cash or shares of the Company stock at the Company's option, anytime under certain conditions, or is automatically payable via the issuance of 200,000 shares if the Company's shares close above $1.00 for ten consecutive days; a $100,000 note; and up to an additional $400,000 in earn-outs over two years if certain milestones are met. The Agreement also contains claw-back provisions if certain revenue conditions are not met.\nOn August 15, 2014, pursuant to a merger agreement (the Fresh Diet Merger Agreement\u201d), the Company acquired The Fresh Diet, Inc. ( The Fresh Diet\u201d or FD\u201d) through a reverse triangular merger as the registrant created a subsidiary corporation (FD Acquisition Corp) that merged with and into FD with FD being the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The purchase price consisted of 10,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock valued at $14,000,000. The majority of FD's current liabilities consisted of approximately $3.8 million of deferred revenues and approximately $2.1 million in short term commercial loans and there were additional ordinary course of business expenses such as trade payables, payroll and sales taxes which varied from month to month. In addition, it had some long term obligations the bulk of which consisted of interest free loans from FD's former shareholders in the amount of approximately $2.2 million which were not due for three years. Prior to the merger FD had purchased an immaterial amount of product from the Company. FD operated as an independent subsidiary subject to oversight of its board of directors and the Company's President and CEO. Effective February 23, 2016, the Company closed a transaction to sell 90% of our ownership in FD to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD who was appointed Interim CEO of FD on February 9, 2016. The consideration to Innovative Food Holdings consisted primarily of a restructuring of our loans, which includes the ability to convert to additional amounts of FD under certain circumstances. Aside from payments related to previously accrued liabilities there were no cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations.\nEffective January 24, 2018, pursuant to an asset acquisition agreement (the iGourmet Asset Acquisition Agreement\u201d), our wholly-owned subsidiary, Innovative Gourmet, LLC acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of iGourmet LLC and iGourmet NY LLC, privately-held New York limited liability companies located in West Pittston, Pennsylvania and engaged in the sale, marketing, and distribution of specialty food and specialty food items through www.igourmet.com, online marketplaces, additional direct-to-consumer platforms, distribution to foodservice, retail stores and other wholesale accounts, pursuant to the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement.\nTransactions With a Major Customer\nTransactions with a major customer and related economic dependence information is set forth (1) following our discussion of Liquidity and Capital Resources, (2) under the heading Major Customer in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and (3) in Business - Relationship with U.S. Foods, and (4) as the second item under Risk Factors.\nIndex\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPrior year balances have been recast to reflect the sale of 90% of our interest in FD in February 2016. Results of discontinued operations are excluded from the accompanying results of operations for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted. See Note 2 - discontinued operations in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nThis discussion may contain forward looking-statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our future results could differ materially from the forward looking-statements discussed in this report. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in the report.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by $6,072,329 or approximately 17.3% to $41,244,717 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $35,172,388 in the prior year.\nWe continue to assess the potential of new revenue sources from the manufacture and sale of proprietary food products, private label products and additional sales channel opportunities in both the foodservice and consumer space and will implement a strategy which based on our analysis provides the most beneficial opportunity for growth.\nAny changes in the food distribution and specialty foods operating landscape that materially hinders our current ability and/or cost to deliver our products to our customers could potentially cause a material impact on our net revenue and gross margin and, therefore, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nCurrently, a small portion of our revenues comes from imported products or international sales. Our current sales from such markets may be hampered and negatively impacted by any economic tariffs that may be imposed in the United States or in foreign countries.\nSee Transactions with Major Customers\u201d and the Securities and Exchange Commission's ( SEC\u201d) mandated FR-60 disclosures following the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section for a further discussion of the significant customer concentrations, loss of significant customer, critical accounting policies and estimates, and other factors that could affect future results.\nCost of goods sold\nOur cost of goods sold for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $27,619,026, an increase of $3,116,762 or approximately 12.7% compared to cost of goods sold of $24,502,264 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Cost of goods sold is made up of the following expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017: cost of goods of specialty, meat, game, cheese, seafood, poultry and other sales categories in the amount of $19,792,767; and shipping, delivery, handling, and purchase allowance expenses in the amount of $7,826,259. Total gross margin was approximately 33.1% of sales in 2017 compared to approximately 30.3% of sales in 2016. The increase in cost of goods sold is primary attributable to an increase in sales. The increase in gross margins from 2016 are primarily attributable to variation in product and revenue mix across our various selling channels.\nIn 2017, we continued to price our products in order to gain market share and increase the number of our end users. We were successful in both increasing sales and increasing market share. We currently expect, if market conditions and our product revenue mix remain constant, that our cost of goods sold may increase.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $1,566,375 or approximately 21.3% to $8,936,709 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7,370,334 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs of approximately $539,366 (net of a decrease in non-cash compensation in the amount of $504,873), and an increase in professional and legal costs in the amount of $564,653. The increase in payroll was due primarily to the acquisition of Oasis in January, 2017; the increase in legal and professional fees was due primarily to legal activities including legal and accounting expenses related the acquisition of certain assets of iGourmet LLC, and in addition, to other legal, litigation and accounting related expenses in 2017.\nIndex\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased by $323,665 or approximately 67.0% to $159,720 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $483,385 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in amortization of the discount on notes payable, which was $185,018 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $185,018 compared to $370,036 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. In addition, interest accrued or interest paid or accrued on the Company's commercial loans and notes payable decreased by $42,860 to $76,635 during the current period, compared to $119,495 during the prior year, and interest income increased by $9,698 to $15,844 during the current period compared to $6,146 during the prior year. The Company also had a reduction of interest as a result of negotiations with certain noteholders which resulted in a reduction of accrued interest in the amount of $86,089. Without this adjustment, and adding back interest income of $15,844, gross interest expense would have been $261,653 for the period.\nNet income from continuing operations\nFor the reasons above, the Company had net income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 of $4,529,262 which is an increase of approximately $1,712,857 or 60.8% compared to a net income of $2,816,405 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The income for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a total of $1,158,265 in non-cash charges, including amortization of intangible assets in the amount of $370,768, depreciation expense of $162,705, charges for non-cash compensation in the amount of $439,774, and amortization of the discount on notes payable in the amount of $185,018. The income for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a total of $1,837,094 in non-cash charges, including amortization of intangible assets in the amount of $232,768, depreciation expense of $158,143, charges for non-cash compensation in the amount of $1,076,147, and amortization of the discount on notes payable in the amount of $370,036.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources at December 31, 2017\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had current assets of $8,526,132, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $5,133,435; trade accounts receivable of $2,042,505; inventory of $937,962; notes receivable of $325,500; and other current assets of $86,730. Also at December 31, 2017, the Company had current liabilities of $2,399,274, consisting of trade payables and accrued liabilities of $1,836,559; accrued interest of $15,860; current portion of notes payable and capital leases of $346,855; and current portion of contingent liability of $200,000.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had cash provided by operating activities of $3,419,402. Cash flow from operations consisted of the Company's consolidated net income of $4,529,262 plus non-cash compensation in the amount of $439,774; non-cash amortization of discount on notes payable of $185,018; and depreciation and amortization of $533,473. The Company's cash position decreased by $2,268,125 as a result of changes in the components of current assets and current liabilities, primarily a reduction in accrued liabilities related to related to discontinued operations in the amount of $1,478,887.\nThe Company had cash used in investing activities of $675,345 for the year ended December 31, 2017, which consisted of cash paid in the acquisition of Oasis in the amount of $300,000, cash loaned to iGourmet LLC under a note agreement in the amount of $325,500; and cash paid for the acquisition of property and equipment in the amount of $49,845. The Company had cash used in financing activities of $1,374,675 for the year ended December 31, 2017, which consisted of principal payments made on notes payable of $997,544; principal payments on capital leases of $9,287, payments made for the purchase of treasury stock of $505,660; and payments made for the purchase of options from officers, directors, and employees of $163,925. The Company also received cash of $196,741 from the exercise of warrants for common stock, and $105,000 from the exercise of common stock options.\nThe Company had net working capital of $6,126,858 as of December 31, 2017. The Company had cash provided by operations during the year ended December 31, 2017 in the amount of $3,419,402; this amount is net of certain payments in the amount of $1,478,887 related to discontinued operations which relate mainly to a transaction to purchase the rights to 1,450,000 RSUs and 642,688 shares of the Company's common stock from a former FD employee which resulted in $850,000 in non-recurring cash payments. This compares to cash generated from operating activities of $3,469,096 during the year ended December 31, 2016. Without the cash flow items associated with discontinued operations, operating cash flow would have been $4,898,289 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company intends to continue to focus on increasing market share and cash flow from operations by focusing its sales activities on specific market segments and new product lines. Currently, we do not have any material long-term obligations other than those described in Note 13 to the financial statements included in this report. As we seek to increase our sales of new items and enter new markets, acquire new businesses as well as identify new and other consumer and food service oriented products and services, we may use existing cash reserves, long-term financing, or other means to finance such diversification.\nIndex\nIn February 2016, we completed the sale of FD to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD. See Note 3 to the accompanying financial statements.\nIf the Company's cash flow from operations is insufficient to fully implement its business plan, the Company may require additional financing in order to execute its operating plan. The Company cannot predict whether this additional financing will be in the form of equity or debt, or be in another form. The Company may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIn any of these events, the Company may be unable to implement its current plans for expansion, repay its debt obligations as they become due or respond to competitive pressures, any of which circumstances would have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n2018 Plans\nDuring 2018, in addition to our efforts to increase sales in our existing foodservice operations we plan to attempt to expand our business by expanding our focus to additional specialty foods markets in both the consumer and foodservice sector, exploring potential acquisition and partnership opportunities and continuing to extend our focus in the specialty food market through the growth of the Company's existing sales channels and through a variety of additional sales channel relationships which are currently being explored. In addition, we are currently exploring the introduction of a variety of new product categories and new product lines, including private label products and proprietary branded products to leverage our existing foodservice and consumer customer base.\nFurthermore, the Company intends to expand its activities in the direct to consumer space and the overall consumer packaged goods (CPG) space through leveraging the assets acquired from iGourmet LLC and through leveraging its overall capabilities in the consumer space.\nNo assurances can be given that any of these plans will come to fruition or that if implemented that they will necessarily yield positive results.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nInflation\nIn the opinion of management, inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of its operations.\nTransactions with Major Customers\nThe Company's largest customer, US Foods, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 72% of total sales in each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. A contract between our subsidiary, Food Innovations, and USF entered an optional renewal period in December 2012 but was automatically extended for an additional 12 months in each of January 1, 2013 and 2014. On January 26, 2015 we executed a contract between Food Innovations, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and U.S. Foods, Inc. The term of the Agreement is from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016 and provides for a limited number of automatic annual renewals thereafter if no party gives the other 30 days' notice of its intent not to renew. Based on the terms, the Agreement was extended through 2018. Effective January 1, 2018 the Agreement was further amended to remove the cap on renewals, and provide for an unlimited number of additional 12-month terms unless either party notifies the other in writing, 30 days prior to the end date, of its intent not to renew.\nIndex\nITEM 8.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBusiness Activity\nOur business is currently conducted by our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Artisan ( Artisan\u201d), Food Innovations ( FII\u201d), Food New Media Group, Inc.

In our business model, we receive orders from our customers and then work closely with our suppliers and our warehouse facilities to have the orders fulfilled. In order to maintain freshness and quality, we carefully select our suppliers based upon, among other factors, their quality, uniqueness, reliability and access to overnight courier services.\nArtisan is a supplier of over 1,500 unique specialty foodservice products to over 500 customers in the Greater Chicago area. Haley provides consulting services and other solutions to its clients in the food industry.

As a result of the sale, the results of operations for all periods have been included in Net income from discontinued operations\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations. See Note 3 - Discontinued Operations for additional information.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Accounts subject to estimate and judgements are accounts receivable reserves, income taxes, intangible assets, contingent liabilities, and equity based instruments. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe our estimates have not been materially inaccurate in past years, and our assumptions are not likely to change in the foreseeable future.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Artisan, Food Innovations, FNM, OFB, GFG, Gourmet Foodservice Warehouse, Inc., Gourmeting, Inc., Haley, Innovative Gourmet, Food Funding, and Gourmet. All accounts of FD have been included under discontinued operations. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation of these entities.\nIndex\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue upon product delivery. All of our products are shipped either same day or overnight or through longer shipping terms to the customer and the customer takes title to product and assumes risk and ownership of the product when it is delivered. Shipping charges to customers and sales taxes collectible from customers, if any, are included in revenues.\nFor revenue from product sales, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB\u201d Accounting Standards Codification ASC\u201d 605-15-05. ASC 605-15-05 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company defers any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.\nCost of goods sold\nWe have included in cost of goods sold all costs which are directly related to the generation of revenue. These costs include primarily the cost of food and raw materials, packing and handling, shipping, and delivery costs.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nWe have included in selling, general, and administrative expenses all other costs which support the Company's operations but which are not includable as a cost of sales. These include primarily payroll, facility costs such as rent and utilities, selling expenses such as commissions and advertising, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation, and other administrative costs including professional fees and costs associated with non-cash stock compensation. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents include all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less which are not securing any corporate obligations.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company's estimate is based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable. It is reasonably possible that the Company's estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change. Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $63,267 and $8,123 at December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are valued at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives up to five years using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nThe estimated service lives of property and equipment are as follows:\n\nInventories\nInventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and is determined by the first-in, first-out method.\nIndex\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets, including tax loss and credit carryforwards, and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amount of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable, line of credit, accounts payable and accrued expenses, none of which is held for trading, approximates their estimated fair values due to the short-term maturities of those financial instruments.\nThe Company adopted ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements\u201d (SFAS 157), which provides a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its property and equipment and any identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The test for impairment is required to be performed by management at least annually. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted operating cash flow expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nComprehensive Income\nASC 220-10-15 Reporting Comprehensive Income,\u201d establishes standards for reporting and displaying of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, ASC 220-10-15 requires that all items that are required to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. The Company does not have any items of comprehensive income in any of the periods presented.\nCost Method Investments\nThe Company has made several investments in early stage private food related companies and are accounting for these investments under the cost method.\nBasic and Diluted Income Per Share\nBasic net earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, while fully-diluted net earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive securities assumed to be outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive securities consist of options and warrants to purchase common stock, and convertible debt. Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.\nThe Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of outstanding stock options and warrants. Stock options and warrants for which the exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per common share and, accordingly, are excluded from the calculation.\nIndex\nDilutive shares at December 31, 2017:\nConvertible notes and interest\nAt Dec 31, 2017 the Company there are no convertible notes outstanding.\nWarrants\nAt Dec 31, 2017 there are no warrants outstanding.\nStock Options\nThe following table summarizes the options outstanding and the related prices for the options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock issued by the Company:\n\nThe Company is also committed to issue a total of 115,941 shares pursuant to the cashless conversion of an aggregate 500,000 options consisting of 300,000 options at a price of $0.35 per share, and 200,000 options at a price of $0.57 per share, The shares, which the Company intends to issue in April 2018, represent a net amount after aggregate cash payments of $167,000, which was a portion of the difference between the exercise price of the options and the market price of the stock on the date of purchase, and taxes.\nRSUs\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company cancelled all outstanding restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) and replaced them with common stock or restricted stock awards; see note 16.\nAt December 31, 2017, there are no RSUs outstanding.\nWe recognized stock-based compensation expense for RSUs in a straight-line manner over the vesting period of the grant. This resulted in stock-based compensation expense of $0 and $658,709 related to recognition of RSUs during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company cancelled unvested RSUs representing 1,370,000 shares of common stock and replaced them with restricted stock awards also representing 1,370,000 shares of common stock. The restricted stock awards vested over the same vesting period and under the same terms as the RSUs they replaced. Restricted stock awards representing 1,070,000 shares were vested at December 31, 2017; there are a total of 300,000 unvested restricted stock awards remaining. Those 300,000 restricted stock awards will vest as follows: 125,000 restricted stock awards will vest contingent upon the attainment of a stock price of $2.00 per share for 20 straight trading days, and an additional 175,000 restricted stock awards will vest contingent upon the attainment of a stock price of $3.00 per share for 20 straight trading days. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized expense of $240,208 for the vesting of restricted stock awards, the same amount of expense that would have been recognized had the RSUs not been replaced by the restricted stock awards. As the restricted stock awards were not in place during the year ended December 31, 2016, there was no such cost during that period.\nIndex\nDilutive shares at December 31, 2016:\nConvertible notes and interest\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding convertible notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of $647,565 with accrued interest of $626,873 convertible at the rate of $0.25 per share into an aggregate 5,097,752 shares of common stock. These notes were issued mainly as part of a debt financing into the Company in 2004 and have certain restrictions on repayment. The Company also has a note payable to a related party in the amount of $164,650 convertible at the rate of $0.25 per share into an aggregate of 658,600 shares of common stock.\nWarrants\nAlso at December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding warrants for holders to purchase the following additional shares: The following warrants were issued in connection to a 2004 equity investment into the Company: 2,294,493 shares exercisable at a price of $0.575 per share; 448,010 shares exercisable at a price of $0.55 per share; and 94,783 shares exercisable at a price of $0.25 per share. In addition the Company has 700,000 warrants outstanding exercisable at a price of $0.01 per share. These warrants were originally issued in connection with the issuance of a loan connected to the Artisan Specialty Foods acquisition. 800,000 of the original warrants were cancelled upon the early payment of the loan in 2012, leaving the current 700,000 connected to the Artisan loan previously outstanding.\nStock options\nThe following table summarizes the options outstanding and the related prices for the options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock issued by the Company at December 31, 2016:\n\nRSUs\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company has issued restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) for the potential issuance of shares of the Company's common stock for the purpose of aligning executives and employees of the Company and for the purpose of compensation for serving as members of the Board of Directors of the Company and for the purposes of retaining qualified personnel at compensation levels that otherwise would not be available should the company have been required to pay certain salaries in cash only. Certain RSUs were issued to the executive officers of the Company ( Executive RSUs\u201d); certain RSUs were issued to the employees of the Company ( Employee RSUs\u201d); certain RSUs were issued to members of the board of directors of the Company ( Board RSUs\u201d); and certain of the RSUs were issued to employees of FD ( FD RSUs\u201d).\nIndex\nAt December 31, 2016, the following Executive RSUs were outstanding: A total of 1,737,072 RSUs were vested, and 800,000 will vest on July 1, 2017. An additional 125,000 RSUs will vest contingent upon the attainment of a stock price of $2.00 per share for 20 straight trading days, and an additional 175,000 RSUs will vest contingent upon the attainment of a stock price of $3.00 per share for 20 straight trading days. The Company estimated that the stock-price goals of the Company's stock price closing above $2.00 per share for 20 straight days have a 90% likelihood of achievement, and these RSUs were valued at 90% of their face value; the Company also estimated that the likelihood of the Company's stock closing above $3.00 per share for 20 straight days is 70%, and these RSUs were valued at 70% of their face value. We recognized stock-based compensation expense of in a straight-line manner over the vesting period of the RSUs.\nOn March 31, 2016, 10,000 Board RSUs were issued. On August 3, 2016, 95,000 Board RSUs were exercised by a former Board member. At December 31, 2016, the following Board RSUs were outstanding: a total of 545,000 RSUs were vested, and 270,000 vest on July 1, 2017.\nThe Employee RSUs were issued to certain nonexecutive employees of the Company either partially in lieu of salary, future bonuses or a combination of both bonus and salary. On March 31, 2016, 180,534 Employee RSUs were issued. At December 31, 2016, 180,534 Employee RSUs were outstanding, all of which were vested.\nOn January 26, 2016, 300,000 FD RSUs were exercised, and 800,000 FD RSUs were forfeited. On April 25, 2016, an additional 1,000,000 FD RSUs were forfeited. On June 29, 2016, 200,000 FD RSUs were exercised, and an additional 900,000 FD RSUs were forfeited. At December 31, 2016, 1,000,000 FD RSUs were outstanding; 600,000 were vested, and 400,000 were scheduled to vest on July 1, 2017.\nWe recognized stock-based compensation expense for RSUs in a straight-line manner over the vesting period of the grant. This resulted in stock-based compensation expense of $1,663,309 (including $813,908 charged to discontinued operations) and $4,206,282 (including $2,258,216 charged to discontinued operations) related to recognition of RSUs during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments and related items, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Company places its cash and temporary cash in investments with credit quality institutions. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had cash deposits in excess of applicable government mandated insurance limits in the amount of $3,470,000 and $2,971,942, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, trade receivables from the Company's largest customer amounted to 48% and 44%, respectively, of total trade receivables.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the use of assumptions, including the expected term of the award and the expected stock price volatility. We used the Company's historical volatility to estimate expected stock price volatility. The risk-free rate assumption was based on United States Treasury instruments whose terms were consistent with the expected term of the stock option. The expected dividend assumption was based on the Company's history and expectation of dividend payouts.\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) were measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. RSUs awarded may be conditional upon the attainment of one or more performance objectives over a specified period. At the end of the performance period, if the goals are attained, the awards are granted. Stock-based compensation expense was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and was reduced for estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates. The estimated annual forfeiture rates for stock options and RSUs are based on the Company's historical forfeiture experience. The estimated fair value of stock options and RSUs is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting term of the grant. Compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period based on management's best estimate as to whether it is probable that the shares awarded are expected to vest. Management assesses the probability of the performance milestones being met on a continuous basis.\nIndex\nOptions expense during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized in the table below:\n\nRSUs expense during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized in the table below:\n\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to conform prior period data to the current presentation.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Stock Compensation - Scope of Modification Accounting, which provides guidance on which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The ASU requires that an entity should account for the effects of a modification unless the fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if used), vesting conditions and classification (as equity or liability) of the modified award are all the same as for the original award immediately before the modification. The ASU becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, and should be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company will apply this standard for any awards that are modified after January 1, 2018. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, current U.S. GAAP requires the performance of procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, the amendments under this ASU require the goodwill impairment test to be performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The ASU becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 which amends ASC Topic 230, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.\u201d The amendments in this update address eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The update outlines the classification of specific transactions as either cash inflows or outflows from financing activities, operating activities, investing activities or non-cash activities. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either operating or financing, with such classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and associated disclosures.\nIndex\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), to clarify the principles of recognizing revenue and create common revenue recognition guidance between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Under ASU 2014-09, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for such goods or services. In addition, ASU 2014-09 requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The new revenue standard is principle based and interpretation of those principles may vary from company to company based on their unique circumstances. It is possible that interpretation, industry practice, and guidance may evolve as companies and the accounting profession work to implement this new standard. The Company is still in the process of evaluating the effect of the new standard on the Company's historical financial statements and disclosures. While the Company has not completed its evaluation, the Company currently believes that the impact to revenue and expense recognized will not be material to any of the years presented.\nManagement does not believe that any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\n2. ACQUISITION\nPursuant to the Oasis Asset Purchase Agreement, effective January 1, 2017, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Oasis Sales Corp., purchased certain assets of Oasis Sales and Marketing, L.L.C., a California limited liability company. The purchase price consisted of $300,000 cash; a two-year promissory note in the amount of $100,000, and a structured equity instrument (the SEI\u201d) in the amount of $200,000. In addition, the Company is contingently liable for certain performance-based payments over the twenty-four months following the acquisition date up to a maximum of $400,000 ( Earnout Payments\u201d). Of this amount, $200,000 was carried as a current liability, and $200,000 was carried as a long-term liability on the Company's balance sheet at December 31, 2017.\nThe SEI was payable in cash or shares of the Company's stock at the Company's option, at any time, or is automatically payable via the issuance of 200,000 shares of the Company's stock if the Company's shares close above $1.00 for ten consecutive days. This requirement was met on November 28, 2017, and on that date the $200,000 SEI liability was converted to 200,000 shares of common stock.\nThe Company believes it is likely that the Earnout Payments will be made, and accordingly has recorded the entire amount of $400,000 as a contingent liability on its balance sheet as of the acquisition date. The amount of $800,000 was allocated to customer lists, an intangible asset with a useful life of 60 months; and the amount of $200,000 was allocated to a non-compete agreement, an intangible asset with a useful life of 48 months. A total of $210,000 was amortized to operations during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nEffective February 23, 2016, the Company closed a transaction to sell 90% of our ownership in The Fresh Diet, Inc. ( FD\u201d) to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD who was appointed Interim CEO of FD on February 9 , 2016 . The consideration to Innovative Food Holdings consisted primarily of a restructuring of our loans, which includes the ability to convert to additional amounts of FD under certain circumstances. There is no continuing cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company accrued the amount of $850,000 representing the amount due based on an agreement signed in 2017. The agreement involved the purchase of rights to 1,450,000 RSUs and the purchase of 642,688 shares of the Company's common stock (see note 16).\nASC 360-10-45-9 requires that a long-lived asset (disposal group) to be sold shall be classified as held for sale in the period in which a set of criteria have been met, including criteria that the sale of the asset (disposal group) is probable and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. This criteria was achieved on February 9, 2016. Additionally, the discontinued operations are comprised of the entirety of FD, excluding corporate services expenses. Lastly, for comparability purposes certain prior period line items relating to the assets held for sale have been reclassified and presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nIndex\nThe following information presents the major classes of line items constituting the after-tax loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations:\n\nThe following information presents the major classes of line items constituting significant operating and investing cash flow activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows relating to discontinued operations:\n\nThe components of the gain on sale and income from discontinued operations are as follows:\n\nIndex\n4. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, accounts receivable consists of:\n\n5. INVENTORY\nInventory consists of specialty food products. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, inventory consisted of the following:\n\n6.

The iGourmet LLC Note Receivable bears interest at the rate of 9% per annum, and is due April 1, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded interest income in the amount of $5,238 in the iGourmet Note Receivable. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of iGourmet LLC; see Note 20.\n7. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nAcquisition of Building\nThe Company owns a building and property located at 28411 Race Track Road, Bonita Springs, Florida 34135. The property consists of approximately 1.1 acres of land and approximately 10,000 square feet of combined office and warehouse space, and was purchased as part of a bank short sale. The Company moved its operations to these premises on July 15, 2013. The purchase price of the property was $792,758.\nOn May 14, 2015, the Company purchased a building and property located at 2528 S. 27th Avenue, Broadview, Illinois 60155. The property consists of approximately 1.33 acres of land and approximately 28,711 square feet of combined office and warehouse space. The purchase price of $914,350 was initially financed primarily by a draw-down of $900,000 on the Company's credit facility with Fifth Third Bank. On May 29, 2015, a permanent financing facility was provided by Fifth Third Bank in the form of a loan in the amount of $980,000. $900,000 of this amount was used to pay the balance of the credit facility; the additional $80,000 was used for refrigeration and other improvements at the property. The interest on the loan is at the LIBOR rate plus 3.0%. The building is used for office and warehouse space for the Company's Artisan subsidiary. Depreciation on the building and the related improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment began when the Company occupied the facility in October, 2015.\nA summary of property and equipment at December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\n\nIndex\nDepreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment amounted to $162,705 and $158,143 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n8. INVESTMENTS\nThe Company has made investments in certain early stage food related companies which it expects can benefit from synergies with the Company's various operating businesses. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company acquired a 5.81% equity interest in a food related company for the amount of $51,525, consisting of the conversion to equity of a loan receivable from the investee in the amount $10,863 and the conversion of trade receivable from the investee in the amount of $40,662. At December 31, 2017, the Company has investments in three food related companies in the aggregate amount of $201,525. The Company does not have significant influence over the operations of these three companies.\n9. INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe Company acquired certain intangible assets pursuant to the acquisition of Artisan, OFB, Oasis, and the acquisition of certain assets of Haley. The following is the net book value of these assets:\n\n\nTotal amortization expense charged to operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $370,770 and $232,768, respectively.\nAmortization of finite life intangible assets as of December 31, 2017 is as follows:\n\nThe trade names are not considered finite-lived assets, and are not being amortized. The non-compete agreement is being amortized over a period of 48 months. The customer relationships acquired in the Artisan and Haley transactions are being amortized over periods of 60 months.\nIndex\nAs detailed in ASC 350, the Company tests for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. As detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for goodwill impairment, management has completed a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. To complete this review, management followed the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair value of goodwill and considered all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of goodwill. The analysis completed in 2017 and 2016 determined that there was no impairment to goodwill assets related to the Artisan and Haley transactions.\n10. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are as follows:\n\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, accrued liabilities to related parties consisted of accrued bonus, payroll, and payroll related benefits of $0 and $65,000, respectively.\n11.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company paid cash for interest in the aggregate amount of $74,178.\nAt December 31, 2016, accrued interest was $626,873, convertible at the option of the note holders into the Company's common stock a price of $0.25 per share, or a total of 2,507,492 shares. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company paid cash for interest in the aggregate amount of $96,318.\n12. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES\n\nIndex\n13. NOTES PAYABLE AND NOTES PAYABLE TO RELATED PARTIES\n\nIndex\n\n\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had unamortized discounts to notes payable in the aggregate amount of $0 and $185,020, respectively.\nIndex\nAggregate maturities of long-term notes payable as of December 31, 2017 are as follows:\nFor the twelve months ended December 31,\n\nBeneficial Conversion Features\nThe Company calculates the fair value of any beneficial conversion features embedded in its convertible notes via the Black-Scholes valuation method. The Company also calculates the fair value of any detachable warrants offered with its convertible notes via the Black-Scholes valuation method. The instruments were considered discounts to the notes, to the extent the aggregate value of the warrants and conversion features did not exceed the face value of the notes. These discounts were amortized to interest expense via the effective interest method over the term of the notes.\nThe following table illustrates certain key information regarding our conversion option valuation assumptions at December 31, 2017 and 2016 for options underlying both principal and convertible accrued interest:\n\n14. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017:\nThe Company cancelled RSUs held by its Chief Executive Officer representing 1,382,540 shares of common stock, of which 700,000 were unvested and 682,540 were vested. In place of the 682,540 vested cancelled RSUs, the Company issued a net amount of 586,586 shares of common stock.

The amount due to the Company for these conversions was extended to April 26, 2018. See note 16.\nThe Company's President exercised 100,000 options at a price of $0.35 per share and an additional 100,000 options at a price of $0.57 per share. The amount due to the Company for these conversions was extended to April 26, 2018. See note 16.\nA Director exercised 100,000 options at a price of $0.35 per share. The amount due to the Company for these conversions was extended to April 26, 2018. See note 16.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016:\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had an accrued liability in the amount of $160,150 representing an aggregate of 210,520 shares of common stock to be issued to officers, directors, and employees for services performed during 2013; during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company issued 210,520 RSUs in exchange of this liability. Also at December 31, 2015, the Company had an accrued liability in the amount of $157,780 representing 244,620 RSUs to be issued to officers and employees as a bonus for services performed in 2015; during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 244,620 RSUs in exchange of this liability.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company issued 95,000 shares of its common stock to a former Director of the Company pursuant to the exercise of RSUs.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company purchased the following options held by three of its officers and one of its directors: options to purchase an aggregate 92,500 shares of the Company's common stock exercisable at a price of $0.38 per share were purchased for a total amount of $10,175, and options to purchase an aggregate 275,000 shares of the Company's common stock exercisable at a price of $0.40 per share were purchased for a total amount of $24,750. The purchase price was calculated as the excess of the closing market price of the Company's stock on the purchase date over the exercise price of the options.\nIndex\n15. INCOME TAXES\nDeferred income taxes result from the temporary differences primarily attributable to amortization of intangible assets and debt discount and an accumulation of net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes with a valuation allowance against the carryforwards for book purposes.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Included in deferred tax assets are Federal and State net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $3,400,000, which will expire through 2037. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Due to significant changes in the Company's ownership, the Company's future use of its existing net operating losses may be limited.\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 consist of the following:\n\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable statutory income tax rate of 39.6% for the December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, to the loss before taxes as a result of the following differences:\n\nDeferred income taxes reflect the tax impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations.\nDeferred income taxes include the net tax effects of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets are as follows:\n\nIndex\nThe Company's tax returns for the previous three years remain open for audit by the respective tax jurisdictions.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act establishes new tax laws that affect 2018 and future years, including a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. For certain deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, we have recorded a provisional decrease of $388,000, with a corresponding net adjustment to valuation allowance of $388,000 as of December 31, 2017.\n16.

The Fresh Diet, Inc. f/k/a YS Catering, LLP f/k/a YS Catering, Inc., et al. / Scher Zalman Duchman and Deborah L. Duchman v. Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 17-cv-21027-KMM, United States District Court, Southern District of Florida\nOn July 7, 2017, Scher Zalman Duchman and Deborah L. Duchman (collectively, Duchmans\u201d) filed an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida seeking approximately $1 million in damages against Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., FD Acquisition Corp., and Sam Klepfish, IVFH's CEO. The Duchmans, amongst other things, allege that defendants owed a fiduciary duty to the Duchmans to minimize the Duchmans' own personal guarantees and personal obligations related to loans and other obligations incurred by a former subsidiary of the Company and that the Defendants did not fulfill that alleged fiduciary obligation. By Order dated March 22, 2018, the following causes of action were dismissed without prejudice: Count I, Breach of Fiduciary Duty; Count III, Unjust Enrichment; Count IV, Unjust Enrichment; and Count IX, Fraud in the Inducement. The Court further ordered Count XI, Punitive Damages, stricken from the Complaint and that all claims against Third Party Defendant FD Acquisition Corp. dismissed with prejudice. Discovery is ongoing, and IVFH will soon be filing a motion for summary judgment. The parties have scheduled required mediation. The court has provided a scheduled trial date. IVFH believes that this lawsuit is without merit and is an attempt by the Duchmans to drag IVFH into the Duchmans' personal financial matters which are unrelated to IVFH. While IVFH intends to vigorously defend against this lawsuit, the outcome of this lawsuit cannot ultimately be predicted.\nYS Catering Holdings, Inc., et al. vs. Attollo Partners LLC, Rajesh Rawal, Vojkan Dimitijevic, Asif Syed, Roy Heggland and Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., Case No. 2017-007504-CA-01, Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida\nOn March 26, 2018, YS Catering Holdings, Inc., et al., filed suit against Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. YS alleges claims against IVFH that are almost identical to ones pending in the PNC Bank vs. Fresh Diet, et al. federal court litigation (Case No. 17-cv-21027-KMM) in what we believe is an improper attempt at forum shopping. In addition, YS seeks injunctive relief with respect to the removal of certain trading restrictions and other restrictions on its restricted shares. IVFH intends to move to stay the case pending the outcome of the almost identical PNC federal court litigation involving YS's principal Zalmi Duchman. Discovery in the case is ongoing. While IVFH intends to vigorously defend against this lawsuit, the outcome of this lawsuit cannot ultimately be predicted.\n18. MAJOR CUSTOMER\nThe Company's largest customer, U.S. Foods, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 72% of total sales in each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nOur short-term financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable and other liabilities, consist primarily of instruments without extended maturities, the fair value of which, based on management's estimates, reasonably approximate their book value. The fair value of the Company's stock option, convertible debt features and warrant instruments is determined using option pricing models.\nAs a result of the adoption of ASC 815-40, the Company is required to disclose the fair value measurements required by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.\u201d The other liabilities recorded at fair value in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2009 are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Hierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuations of these liabilities are as follows:\n Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date; Level 2 - In15puts other than Level 1 inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3 - Unobservable inputs, for which little or no market data exist, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. \nAs December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not have financial assets or liabilities that are required to be accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.\n20.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of December 31, 2017 to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, and summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and our disclosure controls and procedures are also effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting - Guidance for Smaller Public Companies issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013).\nSubject to the inherent limitations described in the following paragraph, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2017 at the reasonable assurance level.\nInherent Limitations Over Internal Controls\nInternal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly, our internal controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have made no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nIndex\nAttestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.

However, inasmuch as we only have two independent directors, each Committee only has two members. We are currently seeking to add additional qualified independent directors to the Board of Directors.\nCode of Ethics\nWe have adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to each of our employees, including our CEO, our President, our principal financial officer, CIO, as well as members of our Board of Directors.
