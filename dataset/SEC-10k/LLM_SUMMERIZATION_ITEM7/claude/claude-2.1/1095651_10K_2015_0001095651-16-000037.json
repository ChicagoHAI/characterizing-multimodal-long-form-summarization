For purposes of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the terms \"we,\" \"our\" and \"us\" refer to iStar Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.\nThis discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity during the three-year period ended December 31, 2015. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes for the three-year period ended December 31, 2015 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified in the Company's consolidated financial statements and the related notes to conform to the current period presentation.\nIntroduction\niStar Inc., doing business as \"iStar,\" finances, invests in and develops real estate and real estate related projects as part of its fully-integrated investment platform. We have invested more than $35 billion over the past two decades and are structured as a REIT with a diversified portfolio focused on larger assets located in major metropolitan markets. Our primary business segments are real estate finance, net lease, operating properties and land and development.\nOur real estate finance portfolio is comprised of senior and mezzanine real estate loans that may be either fixed-rate or variable-rate and are structured to meet the specific financing needs of borrowers. Our portfolio also includes preferred equity investments and senior and subordinated loans to business entities, particularly entities engaged in real estate or real estate related businesses, and may be either secured or unsecured. Our loan portfolio includes whole loans and loan participations.\nOur net lease portfolio is primarily comprised of properties owned by us and leased to single creditworthy tenants where the properties are subject to long-term leases. Most of the leases provide for expenses at the facilities to be paid by the tenants on a triple net lease basis. The properties in this portfolio are diversified by property type and geographic location. In 2014, the Company partnered with a sovereign wealth fund to form a venture in which the partners plan to contribute equity to acquire and develop net lease assets.\nOur operating properties portfolio is comprised of commercial and residential properties which represent a diverse pool of assets across a broad range of geographies and property types. We generally seek to reposition or redevelop these assets with the objective of maximizing their value through the infusion of capital and/or intensive asset management efforts. The commercial properties within this portfolio include office, retail, hotel and other property types. The residential properties within this portfolio are generally luxury condominium projects located in major U.S. cities where our strategy is to sell individual units through retail distribution channels.\nOur land and development portfolio is primarily comprised of land entitled for master planned communities as well as waterfront and urban infill land parcels located throughout the U.S. Master planned communities represent large-scale residential projects that we will entitle, plan and/or develop and may sell through retail channels to home builders or in bulk. Waterfront parcels are generally entitled for residential projects and urban infill parcels are generally entitled for mixed-use projects. We may develop these properties ourself or sell to or partner with commercial real estate developers.\nExecutive Overview\nWe have continued to originate investments within our core business segments of real estate finance and net lease, which we anticipate should drive future revenue growth. In addition, we have made significant investments within our operating property and land and development portfolios in order to better position assets for sale. Through strategic ventures, we have partnered with other providers of capital within our net lease segment and with developers with residential building expertise within our land and development segment. These partnerships have had a positive impact on our business, particularly in our land and development segment, which experienced an increase in revenue in 2015.\nAccess to the capital markets has allowed us to extend our debt maturity profile, lower our cost of capital and become primarily an unsecured borrower. In 2015, we entered into the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility with a maximum capacity of $250.0 million. In 2014, we fully repaid our largest secured credit facility using proceeds from unsecured notes issuances. This repayment unencumbered $2.0 billion of collateral and provides us with additional liquidity as we now retain 100% of the proceeds from sales and repayments of these previously encumbered assets, rather than directing them to repay the facility. As of December 31, 2015, we had $711.1 million of cash, which we expect to use primarily to fund future investment activities, pay down debt, and for general corporate purposes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, three of our four business segments, including real estate finance, net lease and operating properties, contributed positively to our earnings. We continue to work on repositioning or redeveloping our transitional operating properties and progressing on the entitlement and development of our land and development assets in order to maximize their value. We intend to continue these efforts, with the objective of having these assets contribute positively to earnings in the future. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a net loss allocable to common shareholders of $52.7 million, compared to a net loss of $33.7 million during the prior year. Adjusted income allocable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $84.0 million, compared to $109.4 million during the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $62.8 million less in equity method earnings than we did in the prior year, primarily associated with the sales of certain investments in 2014. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in total gross margin from our land and development portfolio, which improved to $49.5 million in 2015 from $17.3 million in 2014.\nResults of

decreased to $229.7 million in 2015 from $243.1 million in 2014.\nOperating lease income from net lease assets decreased slightly to $151.5 million in 2015 from $151.9 million in 2014. The net lease portfolio generated an unleveraged yield of 7.8% for 2015 as compared to 7.9% for 2014 as rental rates for new leases were lower than rental rates for leases that terminated since December 31, 2014. The decrease in operating lease income was driven primarily by a decrease related to asset sales offset by an increase in operating lease income from same store net lease assets. Operating lease income for same store net lease assets, defined as net lease assets we owned on or prior to January 1, 2014 and were in service through December 31, 2015, increased to $140.3 million in 2015 from $137.3 million in 2014 due primarily to an increase in rent per occupied square foot, which was $9.84 for 2015 and $9.56 for 2014, and an increase in the occupancy rate, which was 95.7% as of December 31, 2015 and 95.0% as of December 31, 2014.\nOperating lease income from commercial operating properties decreased to $77.0 million in 2015 from $87.7 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of a leasehold interest in an operating property and other asset sales, partially offset by additional income in 2015 for three commercial operating properties acquired in 2014 and an increase in leasing activity at other properties. Operating lease income for same store commercial operating properties, defined as commercial operating properties, excluding hotels, we owned on or prior to January 1, 2014 and were in service through December 31, 2015, increased to $60.7 million in 2015 from $56.8 million in 2014 due primarily to an increase in occupancy rates, which increased to 74.7% as of December 31, 2015 from 68.2% as of December 31, 2014. The increase was partially offset by a decline in rent per occupied square foot for same store commercial operating properties, which was $21.64 for 2015 and $23.01 for 2014. Ancillary operating lease income for residential operating properties and land and development assets decreased to $1.2 million in 2015 from $3.5 million in 2014.\nInterest income increased to $134.7 million in 2015 as compared to $122.7 million in 2014 due primarily to an increase in the size of the loan portfolio, partially offset by $6.3 million of income recognized in 2014 from the acquisition and repayment of a loan. New investment originations and additional fundings on existing loans raised our average balance of performing loans to $1.52 billion for 2015 from $1.27 billion for 2014. The weighted average yield of our performing loans decreased to 8.8% for\n2015 from 9.1% for 2014, excluding $6.3 million of income recognized from the acquisition and repayment of a loan, due primarily to lower interest rates on loan originations in 2015 and payoffs of loans with higher interest rates.\nOther income decreased to $49.9 million in 2015 as compared to $81.0 million in 2014. The decrease in 2015 was due to gains on sales of non-performing loans of $19.1 million, income related to a lease modification fee of $5.3 million and income related to an early termination fee of $3.4 million all recognized in 2014. The decrease was partially offset by a $5.5 million financing commitment termination fee recognized in 2015.\nLand development revenue and cost of sales-In 2015, we sold residential lots, units and parcels for proceeds of $100.2 million which had associated cost of sales of $67.4 million. In 2014, we sold residential lots and units for proceeds of $15.2 million which had associated cost of sales of $12.8 million. The increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the progression of our land and development projects in 2015, including the sale of two land parcels for land development revenue of $62.8 million resulting in a gross margin of $24.2 million.\nCosts and expenses-Interest expense remained constant at $224.6 million in 2015 as compared to $224.5 million in 2014. This was due to a higher average outstanding debt balance offset by a lower weighted average cost of debt. The average outstanding balance of our debt increased to $4.18 billion for 2015 from $4.08 billion for 2014. Our weighted average cost of debt decreased to 5.4% for 2015 from 5.5% for 2014.\nReal estate expenses decreased to $146.8 million in 2015 as compared to $163.4 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily related to expenses associated with residential units, which decreased to $14.2 million in 2015 from $25.6 million in 2014 due to unit sales. The decrease was also related to a decline in expenses for commercial operating properties to $81.7 million in 2015 from $87.9 million in 2014 which was primarily due to the sale of operating properties in 2015 and late 2014. Expenses for same store commercial operating properties, excluding hotels, increased slightly to $39.7 million from $39.2 million in 2015. Expenses for net lease assets decreased to $21.9 million in 2015 from $23.0 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to asset sales during 2014. Expenses for same store net lease assets increased to $20.2 million in 2015 from $19.9 million for 2014. Carry costs and other expenses on our land and development assets increased to $29.0 million in 2015 as compared to $26.9 million in 2014, primarily related to an increase in costs incurred on certain land and development projects and an increase in marketing costs.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased to $65.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 from $73.6 million for the same period in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of a leasehold interest in an operating property and other asset sales in 2015 and accelerated depreciation related to terminated leases during 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased to $81.3 million in 2015 as compared to $88.3 million in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in compensation related costs pertaining to annual performance based bonuses.\nThe net provision for loan losses was $36.6 million in 2015 as compared to a net recovery of loan losses of $1.7 million in 2014. Included in the net provision for 2015 were provisions for specific reserves of $34.1 million due primarily to one new non-performing loan and an increase in the general reserve of $2.5 million due primarily to new investment originations. Included in the net recovery for 2014 were recoveries of previously recorded loan loss reserves of $10.1 million, provisions for specific reserves of $4.1 million and an increase of $4.3 million in the general reserve due primarily to new investment originations.\nIn 2015, we recorded impairments on real estate assets totaling $10.5 million resulting from a change in business strategy on one land and development asset and two commercial operating properties and unfavorable local market conditions for one residential property. In 2014, we recorded impairments on real estate assets totaling $34.6 million resulting from changes in business strategies for one residential property and one land and development asset, continued unfavorable local market conditions at two real estate properties and the sale of net lease assets.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt, net-In 2015 and 2014, we incurred losses on early extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million and $25.4 million, respectively. In 2015, net losses on the early extinguishment of debt related to accelerated amortization of discounts and fees in connection with amortization payments of our 2012 Secured Credit Facilities. In 2014, together with cash on hand, net proceeds from the 2014 issuances of our 4.00% senior unsecured notes due November 2017 and our 5.00% senior unsecured notes due July 2019 were used to fully repay and terminate our secured credit facility entered into in February 2013. As a result, in 2014, we expensed $22.8 million relating to accelerated amortization of discount and fees associated with the payoff of that secured credit facility. We also recorded $2.6 million of losses in 2014 related to the accelerated amortization of discounts and fees in connection with amortization payments that we made on our secured credit facilities.\nEarnings from equity method investments-Earnings from equity method investments decreased to $32.2 million in 2015 as compared to $94.9 million in 2014. In 2015, we recognized $23.6 million related to sales activity on a land development venture, $5.2 million related to leasing operations at our Net Lease Venture and an aggregate $3.4 million in earnings from our remaining\nequity method investments. In 2014, we recognized $56.8 million of income resulting from asset sales by two of our equity method investees and a legal settlement received by one of the investees. We also recognized $14.7 million of earnings related to sales activity on a land and development venture, $9.0 million of income related to carried interest from a previously held strategic investment and an aggregate $14.4 million related to earnings from our remaining equity method investments.\nIncome tax (expense) benefit-Income taxes are primarily generated by assets held in our TRS. Income tax expense increased to $7.6 million in 2015 as compared to $3.9 million in 2014. The increase in current income tax expense relates primarily to taxable income generated by the sales of TRS properties.\nIncome from sales of real estate-Income from sales of real estate increased to $93.8 million in 2015 from $89.9 million in 2014. In 2015, we sold 12 net lease assets resulting in gains of $40.1 million. We also sold a commercial operating property for $68.5 million to a newly formed unconsolidated entity in which we own a 50% equity interest and recognized a gain on sale of $13.6 million, reflecting our share of the interest sold. In 2015 and 2014, we sold residential condominiums that resulted in income of $40.1 million and $79.1 million, respectively. In 2014, we sold net lease assets with a carrying value of $8.0 million resulting in a gain of $6.2 million and a commercial operating property with a carrying value of $29.4 million resulting in a gain of $4.6 million.\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

2014 from $234.6 million in 2013.\nOperating lease income from net lease assets increased to $151.9 million in 2014 from $147.3 million in 2013. The net lease portfolio generated an unleveraged yield of 7.9% for 2014 as compared to 7.2% for 2013 as rental rates for new leases were greater than rental rates for leases that terminated since December 31, 2013. Operating lease income for same store net lease assets, defined as net lease assets we owned on or prior to January 1, 2013 and were in service through December 31, 2014, increased to $148.3 million in 2014 from $146.2 million in 2013 due primarily to an increase in rent per occupied square foot for same store net lease assets, which was $9.86 for 2014 as compared to $9.62 for 2013. The increase in operating lease income was also due to higher occupancy rates for same store net lease assets, which was 95.2% as of December 31, 2014 as compared to 93.0% as of December 31, 2013. We had two net lease assets which were sold to our Net Lease Venture in 2014 that, prior to their sale, contributed an additional $2.0 million of operating lease income in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nOperating lease income from commercial operating properties increased to $87.7 million in 2014 from $86.4 million in 2013 as rental rates for new leases were greater than leases that terminated since December 31, 2013. Operating lease income for same store commercial operating properties, defined as commercial operating properties, excluding hotels, we owned on or prior to January 1, 2013 and were in service through December 31, 2014, decreased to $81.6 million in 2014 from $84.9 million in 2013 due primarily to a decline in rent per occupied square foot for same store commercial operating properties, which was $24.52 for 2014 and $26.06 for 2013. The decline was partially offset by an increase in occupancy rates for same store commercial operating properties, which increased to 65.0% as of December 31, 2014 from 62.8% as of December 31, 2013. In addition, we acquired title to additional commercial operating properties in 2014, which contributed $4.5 million to operating lease income in 2014. Ancillary operating lease income for residential operating properties increased $2.6 million in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nInterest income increased to $122.7 million in 2014 as compared to $108.0 million in 2013 due primarily to increases in the volume and interest rates of performing loans. New investment originations and additional fundings of existing loans raised our average balance of performing loans to $1.27 billion for 2014 from $1.23 billion for 2013. The weighted average yield of our performing loans increased to 9.1%, excluding $6.3 million of income recognized from the acquisition and repayment of a loan, for 2014 from 7.6% for 2013 due primarily to higher interest rates for new loan originations in 2014 and payoffs of loans with lower interest rates.\nOther income increased to $81.0 million in 2014 as compared to $48.2 million in 2013. The increase was due to gains on sales of non-performing loans of $19.1 million as well as $16.5 million of income related to asset related settlements, $3.8 million of ancillary income from properties acquired in 2014 and $2.3 million of prior year tax refunds. The increases were offset in part by a decline of $7.2 million due primarily to the conversion of hotel rooms to residential units to be sold at a property and $4.0 million received for the settlement of a property-related lawsuit in 2013.\nLand development revenue and cost of sales-In 2014, we sold residential lots and units from three of our master planned community properties for proceeds of $15.2 million which had associated cost of sales of $12.8 million.\nCosts and expenses-Interest expense decreased to $224.5 million in 2014 as compared to $266.2 million in 2013 due to a lower average outstanding debt balance and a lower weighted average cost of debt. The average outstanding balance of our debt declined to $4.08 billion for 2014 from $4.46 billion for 2013. Our weighted average effective cost of debt decreased to 5.5% for 2014 from 5.9% for 2013. The decline was primarily a result of the refinancing of higher interest rate senior unsecured notes with lower interest rate senior unsecured notes during 2013.\nReal estate expenses increased to $163.4 million in 2014 as compared to $157.4 million in 2013. Expenses for commercial operating properties increased to $87.9 million in 2014 from $81.1 million in 2013. In 2014, expenses for same store commercial operating properties, excluding hotels, increased to $53.3 million from $51.7 million in 2013 due primarily to higher operating expenses at two properties. We acquired title to additional commercial operating properties in 2014, which contributed $9.2 million to real estate expenses in 2014. Additionally, expenses for hotel properties decreased to $22.7 million in 2014 from $28.5 million in 2013 due primarily to the conversion of hotel rooms to residential units being sold at a hotel property. Costs associated with residential units increased to $25.6 million in 2014 from $19.8 million in 2013 due to sales assessments at one of our residential properties and carrying costs for additional residential units where construction was completed, offset by a reduction of expenses due to the sale of residential units since December 31, 2013. Carry costs and other expenses on our land and development assets decreased to $26.9 million in 2014 as compared to $33.8 million in 2013, primarily related to a decrease in costs incurred on certain land and development assets prior to development.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased to $88.3 million in 2014 as compared to $92.1 million in 2013, primarily due to a reduction in stock-based compensation expense, based on certain previously issued awards becoming fully amortized in 2013.\nThe net recovery of loan losses was $1.7 million in 2014 as compared to a net provision for loan losses of $5.5 million in 2013. Included in the net recovery for 2014 were recoveries of previously recorded loan loss reserves of $10.1 million, provisions for specific reserves of $4.1 million and an increase of $4.3 million in the general reserve due primarily to new investment originations. Included in the net recovery for 2013 were specific reserves of $72.5 million, which were established on non-performing loans, offset by recoveries of previously recorded loan loss reserves of $63.1 million during the year.\nIn 2014, we recorded impairments on real estate assets totaling $34.6 million resulting from changes in business strategies for one residential property and one land and development asset, continued unfavorable local market conditions at two real estate properties and the sale of several net lease assets. In 2013, we recorded $14.4 million of impairments on real estate assets, including $1.8 million recorded in discontinued operations, due primarily to a changes in local market conditions and a change in business strategy for one residential property.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt, net-In 2014 and 2013, we incurred losses on early extinguishment of debt of $25.4 million and $33.2 million, respectively. In 2014, together with cash on hand, net proceeds from the 2014 issuances of our 4.00% senior unsecured notes due November 2017 and our 5.00% senior unsecured notes due July 2019 were used to fully repay and terminate our secured credit facility entered into in February 2013. As a result, in 2014, we expensed $22.8 million relating to accelerated amortization of discount and fees associated with the payoff of that secured credit facility. We also recorded $2.6 million of losses related to the accelerated amortization of discounts and fees in connection with amortization payments that we made on our secured credit facilities.\nIn 2013, we incurred $7.7 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt due to the accelerated amortization of discounts and fees in connection with the refinancing of a secured credit facility. We also recorded $13.2 million of losses related to the accelerated amortization of discounts and fees in connection with amortization payments that we made on our secured credit facilities. We also redeemed our 5.95% senior unsecured notes due October 2013 and 5.70% senior unsecured notes due March 2014 prior to maturity and incurred $12.3 million of losses related to prepayment penalties and the acceleration of amortization of discounts.\nEarnings from equity method investments-Earnings from equity method investments increased to $94.9 million in 2014 as compared to $41.5 million in 2013. In 2014, we recognized $56.8 million of income resulting from asset sales by two of our equity method investees and a legal settlement received by one of the investees. We also recognized $14.7 million of earnings related to sales activity on a land development venture and $9.0 million of income related to carried interest from a previously held strategic investment. The increase was offset by $12.0 million of income primarily related to asset sales by one of our strategic investments in 2013 and the sale of our interest in LNR Property Corp. in April 2013. We had no equity in earnings from LNR during 2014 as compared to 2013 in which we recorded net equity in earnings of $14.5 million.\nLoss on transfer of interest to unconsolidated subsidiary-In 2013, we entered into a venture with a national homebuilder to jointly develop residential lots in the first phase of Spring Mountain Ranch, a 1,400-lot master planned community. We contributed the initial phase of land, which had a carrying value of $24.1 million, to the venture in exchange for a retained interest of $16.7 million, resulting in a $7.4 million loss.\nIncome tax (expense) benefit-Income taxes are primarily generated by assets held in our TRS. Income taxes increased to a net tax expense of $3.9 million in 2014 as compared to a tax benefit of $0.7 million in 2013. The period to period difference was due primarily to taxable income generated by sales of TRS properties.\nDiscontinued operations-In 2014, we adopted ASU 2014-08 (refer to Note 4), which raised the threshold for discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components that are considered strategic shifts in a company's business. There were no disposals that met this threshold during 2014. Income (loss) from discontinued operations in 2013 includes operating results from net lease assets and commercial operating properties held for sale or sold as of December 31, 2013. During 2013, we sold commercial operating properties with a total carrying value of $72.6 million, which resulted in a net gain of $18.6 million and net lease assets with a total carrying value of $18.7 million which resulted in a net gain of $2.2 million.\nIncome from sales of real estate-In 2014 and 2013, we sold residential condominiums that resulted in income of $79.1 million and $82.6 million, respectively. In 2014, we also sold net lease assets with a carrying value of $8.0 million resulting in a gain of $6.2 million and a commercial operating property with a carrying value of $29.4 million resulting in a gain of $4.6 million. In 2013, we sold land for proceeds of $36.7 million that resulted in income of $4.0 million.\nAdjusted Income\nIn addition to net income (loss) prepared in conformity with GAAP, we use adjusted income, a non-GAAP financial measure, to measure our operating performance. Adjusted income represents net income (loss) allocable to common shareholders, prior to the effect of depreciation and amortization, provision for (recovery of) loan losses, impairment of assets, loss on transfer of interest to unconsolidated subsidiary, stock-based compensation expense, and the non-cash portion of gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt (\"Adjusted Income\").\nWe believe Adjusted Income is a useful measure to consider, in addition to net income (loss), as it may help investors evaluate our operating performance prior to certain non-cash items. Adjusted Income should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) as shown in our consolidated statements of operations. Adjusted Income should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is Adjusted Income indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs or available for distribution to shareholders. Rather, Adjusted Income is an additional measure for us to use to analyze how our business is performing. It should be noted that our manner of calculating Adjusted Income may differ from the calculations of similarly-titled measures by other companies.\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) allocable to common shareholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(52,675\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(33,722\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(155,769\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(272,997\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(62,387\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Depreciation and amortization(1)\n</td> <td>72,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add/Less: Provision for (recovery of) loan losses\n</td> <td>36,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,714\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Impairment of assets(2)\n</td> <td>18,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Loss on transfer of interest to unconsolidated subsidiary\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>12,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Loss (gain) on early extinguishment of debt, net(3)\n</td> <td>281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(101,466\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: HPU/Participating Security allocation\n</td> <td>(2,850\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,791\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,478\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,428\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,891\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted income (loss) allocable to common shareholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,677\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(53,847\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, depreciation and amortization includes $264, $2,016 and $5,837, respectively, of depreciation and amortization reclassified to discontinued operations.

All non-performing loans are placed on non-accrual status and income is only recognized in certain cases upon actual cash receipt. As of December 31, 2015, we had non-performing loans with an aggregate carrying value of $60.3 million compared to non-performing loans of $65.0 million at December 31, 2014. We expect that our level of non-performing loans will fluctuate from period to period.\nReserve for Loan Losses-The reserve for loan losses was $108.2 million as of December 31, 2015, or 6.6% of total loans, compared to $98.5 million or 7.6% as of December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the provision for loan losses includes specific reserves of $34.1 million and an increase of $2.5 million in the general reserve due primarily to new investment originations. We expect that our level of reserve for loan losses will fluctuate from period to period. Due to the volatility of the commercial real estate market, the process of estimating collateral values and reserves requires the use of significant judgment. We currently believe there are adequate collateral and reserves to support the carrying values of the loans.\nThe reserve for loan losses includes an asset-specific component and a formula-based component. An asset-specific reserve is established for an impaired loan when the estimated fair value of the loan's collateral less costs to sell is lower than the carrying value of the loan. As of December 31, 2015, asset-specific reserves increased to $72.2 million compared to $65.0 million as of December 31, 2014, primarily due to one new non-performing loan.\nThe formula-based general reserve is derived from estimated principal default probabilities and loss severities applied to groups of performing loans based upon risk ratings assigned to loans with similar risk characteristics during our quarterly loan portfolio assessment. During this assessment, we perform a comprehensive analysis of our loan portfolio and assign risk ratings to loans that incorporate management's current judgments about their credit quality based on all known and relevant factors that may affect collectability. We consider, among other things, payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. This methodology results in loans being segmented by risk classification into risk rating categories that are associated with estimated probabilities of default and principal loss. We estimate loss rates based on historical realized losses experienced within our portfolio and take into account current economic conditions affecting the commercial real estate market when establishing appropriate time frames to evaluate loss experience.\nThe general reserve increased to $36.0 million or 2.4% of performing loans as of December 31, 2015, compared to $33.5 million or 2.9% of performing loans as of December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the balance of performing loans, which was driven by new investment originations.\nRisk concentrations-Concentrations of credit risks arise when a number of borrowers or tenants related to our investments are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to us, to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.\nSubstantially all of our real estate as well as assets collateralizing our loans receivable are located in the United States. As of December 31, 2015, the only states with a concentration greater than 10.0% were New York with 19.9% and California with 13.6%. As of that date, we also had approximately 30.3% of the carrying value of our assets related to properties located in the northeastern U.S., 17.7% related to properties located in the western U.S., 15.7% related to properties located in the southeastern U.S., 14.0% related to properties located in the mid-Atlantic U.S. and 10.1% related to properties located in the southwestern region of the U.S. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had $18.6 million of international assets. As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio contains concentrations in the following asset types: land 22.7%, office/industrial 22.5%, mixed use/mixed collateral 15.8% and hotel 10.6%. Additional information regarding property/collateral type and geographical region for each segment is in Item 1 - \"Business.\"\nWe underwrite the credit of prospective borrowers and tenants and often require them to provide some form of credit support such as corporate guarantees, letters of credit and/or cash security deposits. Although our loans and real estate assets are geographically diverse and the borrowers and tenants operate in a variety of industries, to the extent we have a significant concentration of interest or operating lease revenues from any single borrower or tenant, the inability of that borrower or tenant to make its payment could have a material adverse effect on us. As of December 31, 2015, our five largest borrowers or tenants collectively accounted for approximately 21% of our 2015 revenues, of which no single customer accounts for more than 6%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we committed to new investments totaling $756.9 million. We funded a total of $662.5 million associated with new investments, prior financing commitments as well as ongoing development during the year. The fundings included $479.6 million in lending and other investments, $95.3 million to develop our land assets and $87.6 million of capital to reposition or redevelop our operating properties and invest in net lease assets. Also during the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated $1.0 billion of proceeds from loan repayments and asset sales within our portfolio, comprised of $454.8 million from real estate finance, $283.8 million from operating properties, $102.3 million from net lease assets, $98.1 million from land and development assets and $32.2 million from other investments. These amounts are inclusive of fundings and proceeds from both consolidated investments and our pro rata share from equity method investments. As of December 31, 2015, we had unrestricted cash of $711.1 million.\nThe following table outlines our capital expenditures on real estate and land and development assets as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, by segment ($ in thousands):\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Properties\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Lease\n</td> <td>6,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures on real estate assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land and Development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures on land and development assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur primary cash uses over the next 12 months are expected to be funding of investments, repayments of debt, capital expenditures and funding ongoing business operations. We repaid the $105.8 million outstanding balance of our 6.05% senior notes due April 2015 at their maturity. We have other debt maturities of $926.4 million due before December 31, 2016. Over the next 12 months, we currently expect to fund in the range of approximately $225 million to $300 million of capital expenditures within our portfolio. The majority of these amounts relate to our land and development and operating properties business segments and include multifamily and residential development activities which are expected to include approximately $130 million in vertical construction. The amount spent will depend on the pace of our development activities as well as the extent to which we strategically partner with others to complete these projects. As of December 31, 2015, we also had approximately $779 million of maximum unfunded commitments associated with our investments of which we expect to fund the majority of over the next two years, assuming borrowers and tenants meet all milestones and performance hurdles and all other conditions to fundings are met. See \"Unfunded Commitments\" below. Our capital sources to meet cash uses through the next 12 months and beyond will primarily be expected to include cash on hand, income from our portfolio, loan repayments from borrowers, proceeds from asset sales and capital raised through debt and/or equity capital raising transactions.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the specific transactions we will undertake to generate sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations as they come due. We will adjust our plans as appropriate in response to changes in our expectations and changes in market conditions. While economic trends have stabilized, it is not possible for us to predict whether these trends will continue or to quantify the impact of these or other trends on our financial results.\nContractual Obligations-The following table outlines the contractual obligations related to our long-term debt obligations, loan participations payable and operating lease obligations as of December 31, 2015 (see Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data-Note 10\").\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amounts Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 - 10\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 10\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,221,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>926,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,524,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>770,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured credit facilities\n</td> <td>339,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>339,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured term loans\n</td> <td>239,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other debt obligations\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total principal maturities\n</td> <td>4,150,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>935,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,141,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>809,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Payable(1)\n</td> <td>546,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>243,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan Participations Payable(2)\n</td> <td>153,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td>26,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>728\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,876,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,138,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,494,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>938,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Variable-rate debt assumes 1-month LIBOR of 0.42% and 3-month LIBOR of 0.32% that were in effect as of December 31, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>We also have issued letters of credit totaling $2.2 million in connection with our investments.

Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest at a floating rate indexed to one of several base rates plus a margin which adjusts upward or downward based upon our corporate credit rating. An undrawn credit facility commitment fee ranges from 0.375% to 0.50%, based on average utilization each quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the weighted average cost of the credit facility was 3.13%. Commitments under the revolving facility mature in March 2018. At maturity, we may convert outstanding borrowings to a one year term loan which matures in quarterly installments through March 2019.\n2012 Secured Credit Facilities-In March 2012, we entered into an $880.0 million senior secured credit agreement providing for two tranches of term loans: a $410.0 million 2012 A-1 tranche due March 2016, which bore interest at a rate of LIBOR + 4.00% (the \"2012 Tranche A-1 Facility\"), and a $470.0 million 2012 A-2 tranche due March 2017, which bears interest at a rate of LIBOR + 5.75% (the \"2012 Tranche A-2 Facility,\" together the \"2012 Secured Credit Facilities\"). The 2012 A-1 and A-2 tranches were issued at 98.0% of par and 98.5% of par, respectively, and both tranches include a LIBOR floor of 1.25%. Proceeds from the 2012 Secured Credit Facilities, together with cash on hand, were used to repurchase and repay other outstanding debt.\nThe 2012 Secured Credit Facilities are collateralized by a first lien on a fixed pool of assets. Proceeds from principal repayments and sales of collateral are applied to amortize the 2012 Secured Credit Facilities. Proceeds received for interest, rent, lease payments and fee income are retained by us. We may also make optional prepayments, subject to prepayment fees. The 2012 Tranche A-1 Facility was fully repaid in August 2013. Additionally, through December 31, 2015, we made cumulative amortization repayments of $130.3 million on the 2012 Tranche A-2 Facility. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, repayments of the 2012 Tranche A-2 Facility prior to maturity resulted in losses on early extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively, related to the accelerated amortization of discounts and unamortized deferred financing fees on the portion of the facility that was repaid. For the year ended December 31, 2013, repayments of the 2012 Tranche A-1 Facility prior to scheduled amortization dates resulted in losses on early extinguishment of debt of $4.4 million. These amounts are included in \"Loss on early extinguishment of debt, net\" in our consolidated statements of operations.\nUnsecured Notes-In June 2014, we issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured notes due November 2017 and $770.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior unsecured notes due July 2019. Net proceeds from these transactions, together with cash on hand, were used to fully repay and terminate the February 2013 Secured Credit Facility which had an outstanding balance of $1.32 billion.\nEncumbered/Unencumbered Assets-As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the carrying value of our encumbered and unencumbered assets by asset type are as follows ($ in thousands):\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Encumbered Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unencumbered Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Encumbered Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unencumbered Assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>816,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>777,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>602,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,213,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate available and held for sale\n</td> <td>10,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land and development\n</td> <td>17,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>984,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>961,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans receivable and other lending investments, net(1)(2)\n</td> <td>170,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,314,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,364,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments\n</td> <td>22,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>336,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and other assets\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,033,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>768,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,037,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,468,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>695,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,801,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________________________________\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the amounts presented exclude general reserves for loan losses of $36.0 million and $33.5 million, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2015, the amount presented excludes loan participations of $153.0 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt Covenants\nOur outstanding unsecured debt securities contain corporate level covenants that include a covenant to maintain a ratio of unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness of at least 1.2x and a covenant not to incur additional indebtedness (except for incurrences of permitted debt), if on a pro forma basis, our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, determined in accordance with the indentures governing our debt securities, is 1.5x or lower. If any of our covenants are breached and not cured within applicable cure periods, the breach could result in acceleration of our debt securities unless a waiver or modification is agreed upon with the requisite percentage of the bondholders. While our ability to incur additional indebtedness under the fixed charge coverage ratio is currently limited, we are permitted to incur indebtedness for the purpose of refinancing existing indebtedness and for other permitted purposes under the indentures.\nThe 2012 Secured Credit Facilities and the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility contain certain covenants, including covenants relating to collateral coverage, dividend payments, restrictions on fundamental changes, transactions with affiliates, matters relating to the liens granted to the lenders and the delivery of information to the lenders. In particular, the 2012 Secured Credit Facilities require us to maintain collateral coverage of at least 1.25x outstanding borrowings on the facilities. The 2015 Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a borrowing base of assets and requires us to maintain both collateral coverage of at least 1.5x outstanding borrowings on the facility and a consolidated ratio of cash flow to fixed charges of at least 1.5x. The 2015 Revolving Credit Facility does not require that proceeds from the borrowing base be used to pay down outstanding borrowings provided the collateral coverage remains at least 1.5x outstanding borrowings on the facility. To satisfy this covenant, we have the option to pay down outstanding borrowings or substitute assets in the borrowing base. In addition, for so long as we maintain our qualification as a REIT, the 2012 Secured Credit Facilities and the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility permit us to distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis (prior to deducting certain cumulative NOL carryforwards in the case of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility). We may not pay common dividends if we cease to qualify as a REIT.\nThe 2012 Secured Credit Facilities and the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility contain cross default provisions that would allow the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate our indebtedness to them if we fail to pay amounts due in respect of our other recourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds or if the lenders under such other indebtedness are otherwise permitted to accelerate such indebtedness for any reason. The indentures governing our unsecured public debt securities permit the bondholders to declare an event of default and accelerate our indebtedness to them if our other recourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds is not paid at final maturity or if such indebtedness is accelerated.\nDerivatives-Our use of derivative financial instruments is primarily limited to the utilization of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps or other instruments to manage interest rate risk exposure and foreign exchange contracts to manage our risk to changes in foreign currencies. See Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data-Note 12\" for further details.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements-We are not dependent on the use of any off-balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity. We have made investments in various unconsolidated ventures. See Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data-Note 7\" for further details of our unconsolidated investments. Our maximum exposure to loss from these investments is limited to the carrying value of our investments and any unfunded commitments (see below).\nUnfunded Commitments-We generally fund construction and development loans and build-outs of space in net lease assets over a period of time if and when the borrowers and tenants meet established milestones and other performance criteria. We refer to these arrangements as Performance-Based Commitments. In addition, we sometimes establish a maximum amount of additional funding which we will make available to a borrower or tenant for an expansion or addition to a project if we approve of the expansion or addition in our sole discretion. We refer to these arrangements as Discretionary Fundings. Finally, we have committed to invest capital in several real estate funds and other ventures. These arrangements are referred to as Strategic Investments. As of December 31, 2015, the maximum amounts of the fundings we may make under each category, assuming all performance hurdles and milestones are met under the Performance-Based Commitments, that we approve all Discretionary Fundings and that 100% of our capital committed to Strategic Investments is drawn down, are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Loans and Other Lending Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Real Estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\nInvestments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance-Based Commitments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>689,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>728,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic Investments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discretionary Fundings\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>694,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>778,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock Repurchase Program-In September 2015, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the repurchase limit under our previously approved stock repurchase program to $50.0 million. In December 2015, after having substantially utilized the availability approved in September 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a new $50.0 million repurchase program. The program authorizes the repurchase of common stock from time to time in open market and privately negotiated purchases, including pursuant to one or more trading plans. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 5.7 million shares of our common stock for $70.4 million, at an average cost of $12.25 per share. There were no stock repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $48.7 million of common stock under our stock repurchase program. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we repurchased 5.2 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $52.0 million, at an average cost of $10.10 per share. In February 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new $50.0 million repurchase program.\nHPU Repurchase-In August 2015, we repurchased and retired all of our outstanding 14,888 HPUs, representing 2.8 million common stock equivalents. We repurchased these HPUs at fair value from current and former employees through an arms-length exchange offer. HPU holders could elect to receive $9.30 in cash or 0.7 shares of iStar common stock, or a combination thereof, per common stock equivalent underlying the HPUs. Approximately 37% of the outstanding HPUs were exchanged for $9.8 million in cash and approximately 63% of the outstanding HPUs were exchanged for 1.2 million shares of our common stock with a fair value of $15.2 million, representing the number of shares issued at the closing price of our common stock on August 13, 2015. The transaction value in excess of the HPUs carrying value of $9.8 million was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings (deficit) in our consolidated statements of changes in equity.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported as assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well controlled, reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. We base our estimates on historical corporate and industry experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and, therefore, routinely require adjustment.\nDuring 2015, management reviewed and evaluated these critical accounting estimates and believes they are appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are described in Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data-Note 3.\" The following is a summary of accounting policies that require more significant management estimates and judgments:\nReserve for loan losses-The reserve for loan losses reflects management's estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. If we determine that the collateral fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying value of a collateral-dependent loan, we will record a reserve. The reserve is increased (decreased) through \"Provision for (recovery of) loan losses\" in our consolidated statements of operations and is decreased by charge-offs. During delinquency and the foreclosure process, there are typically numerous points of negotiation with the borrower as we work toward a settlement or other alternative resolution, which can impact the potential for loan repayment or receipt of collateral. Our policy is to charge off a loan when we determine, based on a variety of factors, that all commercially reasonable means of recovering the loan balance have been exhausted. This may occur at different times, including when we receive cash or other assets in a pre-foreclosure sale or take control of the underlying collateral in full satisfaction of the loan upon foreclosure or deed-in-lieu, or when we have otherwise ceased significant\ncollection efforts. We consider circumstances such as the foregoing to be indicators that the final steps in the loan collection process have occurred and that a loan is uncollectible. At this point, a loss is confirmed and the loan and related reserve will be charged off. We have one portfolio segment, represented by commercial real estate lending, whereby we utilize a uniform process for determining our reserves for loan losses. The reserve for loan losses includes a general, formula-based component and an asset-specific component.\nThe general reserve component covers performing loans and reserves for loan losses are recorded when (i) available information as of each balance sheet date indicates that it is probable a loss has occurred in the portfolio and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The formula-based general reserve is derived from estimated principal default probabilities and loss severities applied to groups of loans based upon risk ratings assigned to loans with similar risk characteristics during our quarterly loan portfolio assessment. During this assessment, we perform a comprehensive analysis of our loan portfolio and assign risk ratings to loans that incorporate management's current judgments about their credit quality based on all known and relevant internal and external factors that may affect collectability. We consider, among other things, payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. This methodology results in loans being segmented by risk classification into risk rating categories that are associated with estimated probabilities of default and principal loss. Ratings range from \"1\" to \"5\" with \"1\" representing the lowest risk of loss and \"5\" representing the highest risk of loss. We estimate loss rates based on historical realized losses experienced within our portfolio and take into account current economic conditions affecting the commercial real estate market when establishing appropriate time frames to evaluate loss experience.\nThe asset-specific reserve component relates to reserves for losses on impaired loans. We consider a loan to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, we believe that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. This assessment is made on a loan-by-loan basis each quarter based on such factors as payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. A reserve is established for an impaired loan when the present value of payments expected to be received, observable market prices, or the estimated fair value of the collateral (for loans that are dependent on the collateral for repayment) is lower than the carrying value of that loan.\nSubstantially all of our impaired loans are collateral dependent and impairment is measured using the estimated fair value of collateral, less costs to sell. We generally use the income approach through internally developed valuation models to estimate the fair value of the collateral for such loans. In more limited cases, we obtain external \"as is\" appraisals for loan collateral, generally when third party participations exist. Valuations are performed or obtained at the time a loan is determined to be impaired and designated non-performing, and they are updated if circumstances indicate that a significant change in value has occurred. In limited cases, appraised values may be discounted when real estate markets rapidly deteriorate.\nA loan is also considered impaired if its terms are modified in a troubled debt restructuring (\"TDR\"). A TDR occurs when we grant a concession to a debtor that is experiencing financial difficulties. Impairments on TDR loans are generally measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the original loan.\nThe provision for (recovery of) loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $36.6 million, $(1.7) million and $5.5 million, respectively. The total reserve for loan losses as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, included asset specific reserves of $72.2 million and $65.0 million, respectively, and general reserves of $36.0 million and $33.5 million, respectively.\nAcquisition of real estate-We generally acquire real estate assets or land and development assets through purchases or through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in full or partial satisfaction of non-performing loans. When we acquire assets these properties are classified as \"Real estate, net\" or \"Land and development\" on our consolidated balance sheets. When we intend to hold, operate or develop the property for a period of at least 12 months, assets are classified as \"Real estate, net,\" and when we intend to market these properties for sale in the near term, assets are classified as \"Real estate available and held for sale.\" When we purchase assets the properties are recorded at cost. Foreclosed assets classified as real estate and land and development are initially recorded at their estimated fair value and assets classified as assets held for sale are recorded at their estimated fair value less costs to sell. The excess of the carrying value of the loan over these amounts is charged-off against the reserve for loan losses. In both cases, upon acquisition, tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their estimated fair values.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we received title to properties in satisfaction of mortgage loans with fair values of $13.4 million, $77.9 million and $31.1 million, respectively, for which those properties had served as collateral.\nImpairment or disposal of long-lived assets-Real estate assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell and are included in \"Real estate available and held for sale\" on our consolidated balance sheets. The difference between the estimated fair value less costs to sell and the carrying value will be recorded as an impairment charge. Impairment for real estate assets disposed of or classified as held for sale on or before December 31, 2013 are\nincluded in \"Income (loss) from discontinued operations\" in our consolidated statements of operations. Impairment for real estate assets disposed of or classified as held for sale after December 31, 2013 are included in \"Impairment of assets\" in our consolidated statements of operations. Once the asset is classified as held for sale, depreciation expense is no longer recorded and historical operating results are reclassified to \"Income (loss) from discontinued operations\" in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe periodically review real estate to be held and used and land and development assets for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The asset's value is impaired only if management's estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the asset (taking into account the anticipated holding period of the asset) is less than the carrying value. Such estimate of cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the asset and reflected as an adjustment to the basis of the asset. Impairments of real estate and land and development assets are recorded in \"Impairment of assets\" in our consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded impairments on real estate and land and development assets totaling $10.5 million resulting from a change in business strategy and unfavorable local market conditions for certain assets. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded impairments on real estate and land and development assets totaling $34.6 million and $14.4 million, respectively, resulting from unfavorable local market conditions and changes in business strategy for certain assets. Of these amounts, $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 has been recorded in \"Income (loss) from discontinued operations\" in our consolidated statements of operations due to the assets being disposed of or classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2013.\nIdentified intangible assets and liabilities-We record intangible assets and liabilities acquired at their estimated fair values, and determine whether such intangible assets and liabilities have finite or indefinite lives. As of December 31, 2015, all such acquired intangible assets and liabilities have finite lives. We amortize finite lived intangible assets and liabilities over the period which the assets and liabilities are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired. We review finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If we determine the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable we will record an impairment charge to the extent its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Impairments of intangibles are recorded in \"Impairment of assets\" in our consolidated statements of operations.\nValuation of deferred tax assets-Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. When evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider, among other matters, estimates of expected future taxable income, nature of current and cumulative losses, existing and projected book/tax differences, tax planning strategies available, and the general and industry specific economic outlook. This realizability analysis is inherently subjective, as it requires us to forecast our business and general economic environment in future periods. Changes in estimate of deferred tax asset realizability, if any are included in \"Income tax (expense) benefit\" in the consolidated statements of operations.\nWhile certain entities with NOLs may generate profits in the future, which may allow us to utilize the NOLs, we continue to record a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset due to the history of losses and the uncertainty of the entities' ability to generate such profits. We recorded a full valuation allowance of $53.9 million and $54.3 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nVariable interest entities-We evaluate our investments and other contractual arrangements to determine if our interests constitute variable interests in a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") and if we are the primary beneficiary. There is a significant amount of judgment required to determine if an entity is considered a VIE and if we are the primary beneficiary. We first perform a qualitative analysis, which requires certain subjective decisions regarding our assessment, including, but not limited to, which interests create or absorb variability, the contractual terms, the key decision making powers, impact on the VIE's economic performance and related party relationships. An iterative quantitative analysis is required if our qualitative analysis proves inconclusive as to whether the entity is a VIE or we are the primary beneficiary and consolidation is required.\nFair value of assets and liabilities-The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities\ncould result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement.\nSee Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data-Note 16\" for a complete discussion on how we determine fair value of financial and non-financial assets and financial liabilities and the related measurement techniques and estimates involved.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes for the three-year period ended December 31, 2015 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified in the Company's consolidated financial statements and the related notes to conform to the current period presentation.\nIntroduction\niStar Inc., doing business as \"iStar,\" finances, invests in and develops real estate and real estate related projects as part of its fully-integrated investment platform. We have invested more than $35 billion over the past two decades and are structured as a REIT with a diversified portfolio focused on larger assets located in major metropolitan markets. Our primary business segments are real estate finance, net lease, operating properties and land and development.\nOur real estate finance portfolio is comprised of senior and mezzanine real estate loans that may be either fixed-rate or variable-rate and are structured to meet the specific financing needs of borrowers. Our portfolio also includes preferred equity investments and senior and subordinated loans to business entities, particularly entities engaged in real estate or real estate related businesses, and may be either secured or unsecured. Our loan portfolio includes whole loans and loan participations.\nOur net lease portfolio is primarily comprised of properties owned by us and leased to single creditworthy tenants where the properties are subject to long-term leases. Most of the leases provide for expenses at the facilities to be paid by the tenants on a triple net lease basis. The properties in this portfolio are diversified by property type and geographic location. In 2014, the Company partnered with a sovereign wealth fund to form a venture in which the partners plan to contribute equity to acquire and develop net lease assets.\nOur operating properties portfolio is comprised of commercial and residential properties which represent a diverse pool of assets across a broad range of geographies and property types. We generally seek to reposition or redevelop these assets with the objective of maximizing their value through the infusion of capital and/or intensive asset management efforts. The commercial properties within this portfolio include office, retail, hotel and other property types. The residential properties within this portfolio are generally luxury condominium projects located in major U.S. cities where our strategy is to sell individual units through retail distribution channels.\nOur land and development portfolio is primarily comprised of land entitled for master planned communities as well as waterfront and urban infill land parcels located throughout the U.S. Master planned communities represent large-scale residential projects that we will entitle, plan and/or develop and may sell through retail channels to home builders or in bulk. Waterfront parcels are generally entitled for residential projects and urban infill parcels are generally entitled for mixed-use projects. We may develop these properties ourself or sell to or partner with commercial real estate developers.\nExecutive Overview\nWe have continued to originate investments within our core business segments of real estate finance and net lease, which we anticipate should drive future revenue growth. In addition, we have made significant investments within our operating property and land and development portfolios in order to better position assets for sale. Through strategic ventures, we have partnered with other providers of capital within our net lease segment and with developers with residential building expertise within our land and development segment. These partnerships have had a positive impact on our business, particularly in our land and development segment, which experienced an increase in revenue in 2015.\nAccess to the capital markets has allowed us to extend our debt maturity profile, lower our cost of capital and become primarily an unsecured borrower. In 2015, we entered into the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility with a maximum capacity of $250.0 million. In 2014, we fully repaid our largest secured credit facility using proceeds from unsecured notes issuances. This repayment unencumbered $2.0 billion of collateral and provides us with additional liquidity as we now retain 100% of the proceeds from sales and repayments of these previously encumbered assets, rather than directing them to repay the facility. As of December 31, 2015, we had $711.1 million of cash, which we expect to use primarily to fund future investment activities, pay down debt, and for general corporate purposes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, three of our four business segments, including real estate finance, net lease and operating properties, contributed positively to our earnings. We continue to work on repositioning or redeveloping our transitional operating properties and progressing on the entitlement and development of our land and development assets in order to maximize their value. We intend to continue these efforts, with the objective of having these assets contribute positively to earnings in the future. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a net loss allocable to common shareholders of $52.7 million, compared to a net loss of $33.7 million during the prior year. Adjusted income allocable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $84.0 million, compared to $109.4 million during the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $62.8 million less in equity method earnings than we did in the prior year, primarily associated with the sales of certain investments in 2014. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in total gross margin from our land and development portfolio, which improved to $49.5 million in 2015 from $17.3 million in 2014.\nResults of

decreased to $229.7 million in 2015 from $243.1 million in 2014.\nOperating lease income from net lease assets decreased slightly to $151.5 million in 2015 from $151.9 million in 2014. The net lease portfolio generated an unleveraged yield of 7.8% for 2015 as compared to 7.9% for 2014 as rental rates for new leases were lower than rental rates for leases that terminated since December 31, 2014. The decrease in operating lease income was driven primarily by a decrease related to asset sales offset by an increase in operating lease income from same store net lease assets. Operating lease income for same store net lease assets, defined as net lease assets we owned on or prior to January 1, 2014 and were in service through December 31, 2015, increased to $140.3 million in 2015 from $137.3 million in 2014 due primarily to an increase in rent per occupied square foot, which was $9.84 for 2015 and $9.56 for 2014, and an increase in the occupancy rate, which was 95.7% as of December 31, 2015 and 95.0% as of December 31, 2014.\nOperating lease income from commercial operating properties decreased to $77.0 million in 2015 from $87.7 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of a leasehold interest in an operating property and other asset sales, partially offset by additional income in 2015 for three commercial operating properties acquired in 2014 and an increase in leasing activity at other properties. Operating lease income for same store commercial operating properties, defined as commercial operating properties, excluding hotels, we owned on or prior to January 1, 2014 and were in service through December 31, 2015, increased to $60.7 million in 2015 from $56.8 million in 2014 due primarily to an increase in occupancy rates, which increased to 74.7% as of December 31, 2015 from 68.2% as of December 31, 2014. The increase was partially offset by a decline in rent per occupied square foot for same store commercial operating properties, which was $21.64 for 2015 and $23.01 for 2014. Ancillary operating lease income for residential operating properties and land and development assets decreased to $1.2 million in 2015 from $3.5 million in 2014.\nInterest income increased to $134.7 million in 2015 as compared to $122.7 million in 2014 due primarily to an increase in the size of the loan portfolio, partially offset by $6.3 million of income recognized in 2014 from the acquisition and repayment of a loan. New investment originations and additional fundings on existing loans raised our average balance of performing loans to $1.52 billion for 2015 from $1.27 billion for 2014. The weighted average yield of our performing loans decreased to 8.8% for\n2015 from 9.1% for 2014, excluding $6.3 million of income recognized from the acquisition and repayment of a loan, due primarily to lower interest rates on loan originations in 2015 and payoffs of loans with higher interest rates.\nOther income decreased to $49.9 million in 2015 as compared to $81.0 million in 2014. The decrease in 2015 was due to gains on sales of non-performing loans of $19.1 million, income related to a lease modification fee of $5.3 million and income related to an early termination fee of $3.4 million all recognized in 2014. The decrease was partially offset by a $5.5 million financing commitment termination fee recognized in 2015.\nLand development revenue and cost of sales-In 2015, we sold residential lots, units and parcels for proceeds of $100.2 million which had associated cost of sales of $67.4 million. In 2014, we sold residential lots and units for proceeds of $15.2 million which had associated cost of sales of $12.8 million. The increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the progression of our land and development projects in 2015, including the sale of two land parcels for land development revenue of $62.8 million resulting in a gross margin of $24.2 million.\nCosts and expenses-Interest expense remained constant at $224.6 million in 2015 as compared to $224.5 million in 2014. This was due to a higher average outstanding debt balance offset by a lower weighted average cost of debt. The average outstanding balance of our debt increased to $4.18 billion for 2015 from $4.08 billion for 2014. Our weighted average cost of debt decreased to 5.4% for 2015 from 5.5% for 2014.\nReal estate expenses decreased to $146.8 million in 2015 as compared to $163.4 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily related to expenses associated with residential units, which decreased to $14.2 million in 2015 from $25.6 million in 2014 due to unit sales. The decrease was also related to a decline in expenses for commercial operating properties to $81.7 million in 2015 from $87.9 million in 2014 which was primarily due to the sale of operating properties in 2015 and late 2014. Expenses for same store commercial operating properties, excluding hotels, increased slightly to $39.7 million from $39.2 million in 2015. Expenses for net lease assets decreased to $21.9 million in 2015 from $23.0 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to asset sales during 2014. Expenses for same store net lease assets increased to $20.2 million in 2015 from $19.9 million for 2014. Carry costs and other expenses on our land and development assets increased to $29.0 million in 2015 as compared to $26.9 million in 2014, primarily related to an increase in costs incurred on certain land and development projects and an increase in marketing costs.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased to $65.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 from $73.6 million for the same period in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of a leasehold interest in an operating property and other asset sales in 2015 and accelerated depreciation related to terminated leases during 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased to $81.3 million in 2015 as compared to $88.3 million in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in compensation related costs pertaining to annual performance based bonuses.\nThe net provision for loan losses was $36.6 million in 2015 as compared to a net recovery of loan losses of $1.7 million in 2014. Included in the net provision for 2015 were provisions for specific reserves of $34.1 million due primarily to one new non-performing loan and an increase in the general reserve of $2.5 million due primarily to new investment originations. Included in the net recovery for 2014 were recoveries of previously recorded loan loss reserves of $10.1 million, provisions for specific reserves of $4.1 million and an increase of $4.3 million in the general reserve due primarily to new investment originations.\nIn 2015, we recorded impairments on real estate assets totaling $10.5 million resulting from a change in business strategy on one land and development asset and two commercial operating properties and unfavorable local market conditions for one residential property. In 2014, we recorded impairments on real estate assets totaling $34.6 million resulting from changes in business strategies for one residential property and one land and development asset, continued unfavorable local market conditions at two real estate properties and the sale of net lease assets.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt, net-In 2015 and 2014, we incurred losses on early extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million and $25.4 million, respectively. In 2015, net losses on the early extinguishment of debt related to accelerated amortization of discounts and fees in connection with amortization payments of our 2012 Secured Credit Facilities. In 2014, together with cash on hand, net proceeds from the 2014 issuances of our 4.00% senior unsecured notes due November 2017 and our 5.00% senior unsecured notes due July 2019 were used to fully repay and terminate our secured credit facility entered into in February 2013. As a result, in 2014, we expensed $22.8 million relating to accelerated amortization of discount and fees associated with the payoff of that secured credit facility. We also recorded $2.6 million of losses in 2014 related to the accelerated amortization of discounts and fees in connection with amortization payments that we made on our secured credit facilities.\nEarnings from equity method investments-Earnings from equity method investments decreased to $32.2 million in 2015 as compared to $94.9 million in 2014. In 2015, we recognized $23.6 million related to sales activity on a land development venture, $5.2 million related to leasing operations at our Net Lease Venture and an aggregate $3.4 million in earnings from our remaining\nequity method investments. In 2014, we recognized $56.8 million of income resulting from asset sales by two of our equity method investees and a legal settlement received by one of the investees. We also recognized $14.7 million of earnings related to sales activity on a land and development venture, $9.0 million of income related to carried interest from a previously held strategic investment and an aggregate $14.4 million related to earnings from our remaining equity method investments.\nIncome tax (expense) benefit-Income taxes are primarily generated by assets held in our TRS. Income tax expense increased to $7.6 million in 2015 as compared to $3.9 million in 2014. The increase in current income tax expense relates primarily to taxable income generated by the sales of TRS properties.\nIncome from sales of real estate-Income from sales of real estate increased to $93.8 million in 2015 from $89.9 million in 2014. In 2015, we sold 12 net lease assets resulting in gains of $40.1 million. We also sold a commercial operating property for $68.5 million to a newly formed unconsolidated entity in which we own a 50% equity interest and recognized a gain on sale of $13.6 million, reflecting our share of the interest sold. In 2015 and 2014, we sold residential condominiums that resulted in income of $40.1 million and $79.1 million, respectively. In 2014, we sold net lease assets with a carrying value of $8.0 million resulting in a gain of $6.2 million and a commercial operating property with a carrying value of $29.4 million resulting in a gain of $4.6 million.\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

2014 from $234.6 million in 2013.\nOperating lease income from net lease assets increased to $151.9 million in 2014 from $147.3 million in 2013. The net lease portfolio generated an unleveraged yield of 7.9% for 2014 as compared to 7.2% for 2013 as rental rates for new leases were greater than rental rates for leases that terminated since December 31, 2013. Operating lease income for same store net lease assets, defined as net lease assets we owned on or prior to January 1, 2013 and were in service through December 31, 2014, increased to $148.3 million in 2014 from $146.2 million in 2013 due primarily to an increase in rent per occupied square foot for same store net lease assets, which was $9.86 for 2014 as compared to $9.62 for 2013. The increase in operating lease income was also due to higher occupancy rates for same store net lease assets, which was 95.2% as of December 31, 2014 as compared to 93.0% as of December 31, 2013. We had two net lease assets which were sold to our Net Lease Venture in 2014 that, prior to their sale, contributed an additional $2.0 million of operating lease income in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nOperating lease income from commercial operating properties increased to $87.7 million in 2014 from $86.4 million in 2013 as rental rates for new leases were greater than leases that terminated since December 31, 2013. Operating lease income for same store commercial operating properties, defined as commercial operating properties, excluding hotels, we owned on or prior to January 1, 2013 and were in service through December 31, 2014, decreased to $81.6 million in 2014 from $84.9 million in 2013 due primarily to a decline in rent per occupied square foot for same store commercial operating properties, which was $24.52 for 2014 and $26.06 for 2013. The decline was partially offset by an increase in occupancy rates for same store commercial operating properties, which increased to 65.0% as of December 31, 2014 from 62.8% as of December 31, 2013. In addition, we acquired title to additional commercial operating properties in 2014, which contributed $4.5 million to operating lease income in 2014. Ancillary operating lease income for residential operating properties increased $2.6 million in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nInterest income increased to $122.7 million in 2014 as compared to $108.0 million in 2013 due primarily to increases in the volume and interest rates of performing loans. New investment originations and additional fundings of existing loans raised our average balance of performing loans to $1.27 billion for 2014 from $1.23 billion for 2013. The weighted average yield of our performing loans increased to 9.1%, excluding $6.3 million of income recognized from the acquisition and repayment of a loan, for 2014 from 7.6% for 2013 due primarily to higher interest rates for new loan originations in 2014 and payoffs of loans with lower interest rates.\nOther income increased to $81.0 million in 2014 as compared to $48.2 million in 2013. The increase was due to gains on sales of non-performing loans of $19.1 million as well as $16.5 million of income related to asset related settlements, $3.8 million of ancillary income from properties acquired in 2014 and $2.3 million of prior year tax refunds. The increases were offset in part by a decline of $7.2 million due primarily to the conversion of hotel rooms to residential units to be sold at a property and $4.0 million received for the settlement of a property-related lawsuit in 2013.\nLand development revenue and cost of sales-In 2014, we sold residential lots and units from three of our master planned community properties for proceeds of $15.2 million which had associated cost of sales of $12.8 million.\nCosts and expenses-Interest expense decreased to $224.5 million in 2014 as compared to $266.2 million in 2013 due to a lower average outstanding debt balance and a lower weighted average cost of debt. The average outstanding balance of our debt declined to $4.08 billion for 2014 from $4.46 billion for 2013. Our weighted average effective cost of debt decreased to 5.5% for 2014 from 5.9% for 2013. The decline was primarily a result of the refinancing of higher interest rate senior unsecured notes with lower interest rate senior unsecured notes during 2013.\nReal estate expenses increased to $163.4 million in 2014 as compared to $157.4 million in 2013. Expenses for commercial operating properties increased to $87.9 million in 2014 from $81.1 million in 2013. In 2014, expenses for same store commercial operating properties, excluding hotels, increased to $53.3 million from $51.7 million in 2013 due primarily to higher operating expenses at two properties. We acquired title to additional commercial operating properties in 2014, which contributed $9.2 million to real estate expenses in 2014. Additionally, expenses for hotel properties decreased to $22.7 million in 2014 from $28.5 million in 2013 due primarily to the conversion of hotel rooms to residential units being sold at a hotel property. Costs associated with residential units increased to $25.6 million in 2014 from $19.8 million in 2013 due to sales assessments at one of our residential properties and carrying costs for additional residential units where construction was completed, offset by a reduction of expenses due to the sale of residential units since December 31, 2013. Carry costs and other expenses on our land and development assets decreased to $26.9 million in 2014 as compared to $33.8 million in 2013, primarily related to a decrease in costs incurred on certain land and development assets prior to development.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased to $88.3 million in 2014 as compared to $92.1 million in 2013, primarily due to a reduction in stock-based compensation expense, based on certain previously issued awards becoming fully amortized in 2013.\nThe net recovery of loan losses was $1.7 million in 2014 as compared to a net provision for loan losses of $5.5 million in 2013. Included in the net recovery for 2014 were recoveries of previously recorded loan loss reserves of $10.1 million, provisions for specific reserves of $4.1 million and an increase of $4.3 million in the general reserve due primarily to new investment originations. Included in the net recovery for 2013 were specific reserves of $72.5 million, which were established on non-performing loans, offset by recoveries of previously recorded loan loss reserves of $63.1 million during the year.\nIn 2014, we recorded impairments on real estate assets totaling $34.6 million resulting from changes in business strategies for one residential property and one land and development asset, continued unfavorable local market conditions at two real estate properties and the sale of several net lease assets. In 2013, we recorded $14.4 million of impairments on real estate assets, including $1.8 million recorded in discontinued operations, due primarily to a changes in local market conditions and a change in business strategy for one residential property.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt, net-In 2014 and 2013, we incurred losses on early extinguishment of debt of $25.4 million and $33.2 million, respectively. In 2014, together with cash on hand, net proceeds from the 2014 issuances of our 4.00% senior unsecured notes due November 2017 and our 5.00% senior unsecured notes due July 2019 were used to fully repay and terminate our secured credit facility entered into in February 2013. As a result, in 2014, we expensed $22.8 million relating to accelerated amortization of discount and fees associated with the payoff of that secured credit facility. We also recorded $2.6 million of losses related to the accelerated amortization of discounts and fees in connection with amortization payments that we made on our secured credit facilities.\nIn 2013, we incurred $7.7 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt due to the accelerated amortization of discounts and fees in connection with the refinancing of a secured credit facility. We also recorded $13.2 million of losses related to the accelerated amortization of discounts and fees in connection with amortization payments that we made on our secured credit facilities. We also redeemed our 5.95% senior unsecured notes due October 2013 and 5.70% senior unsecured notes due March 2014 prior to maturity and incurred $12.3 million of losses related to prepayment penalties and the acceleration of amortization of discounts.\nEarnings from equity method investments-Earnings from equity method investments increased to $94.9 million in 2014 as compared to $41.5 million in 2013. In 2014, we recognized $56.8 million of income resulting from asset sales by two of our equity method investees and a legal settlement received by one of the investees. We also recognized $14.7 million of earnings related to sales activity on a land development venture and $9.0 million of income related to carried interest from a previously held strategic investment. The increase was offset by $12.0 million of income primarily related to asset sales by one of our strategic investments in 2013 and the sale of our interest in LNR Property Corp. in April 2013. We had no equity in earnings from LNR during 2014 as compared to 2013 in which we recorded net equity in earnings of $14.5 million.\nLoss on transfer of interest to unconsolidated subsidiary-In 2013, we entered into a venture with a national homebuilder to jointly develop residential lots in the first phase of Spring Mountain Ranch, a 1,400-lot master planned community. We contributed the initial phase of land, which had a carrying value of $24.1 million, to the venture in exchange for a retained interest of $16.7 million, resulting in a $7.4 million loss.\nIncome tax (expense) benefit-Income taxes are primarily generated by assets held in our TRS. Income taxes increased to a net tax expense of $3.9 million in 2014 as compared to a tax benefit of $0.7 million in 2013. The period to period difference was due primarily to taxable income generated by sales of TRS properties.\nDiscontinued operations-In 2014, we adopted ASU 2014-08 (refer to Note 4), which raised the threshold for discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components that are considered strategic shifts in a company's business. There were no disposals that met this threshold during 2014. Income (loss) from discontinued operations in 2013 includes operating results from net lease assets and commercial operating properties held for sale or sold as of December 31, 2013. During 2013, we sold commercial operating properties with a total carrying value of $72.6 million, which resulted in a net gain of $18.6 million and net lease assets with a total carrying value of $18.7 million which resulted in a net gain of $2.2 million.\nIncome from sales of real estate-In 2014 and 2013, we sold residential condominiums that resulted in income of $79.1 million and $82.6 million, respectively. In 2014, we also sold net lease assets with a carrying value of $8.0 million resulting in a gain of $6.2 million and a commercial operating property with a carrying value of $29.4 million resulting in a gain of $4.6 million. In 2013, we sold land for proceeds of $36.7 million that resulted in income of $4.0 million.\nAdjusted Income\nIn addition to net income (loss) prepared in conformity with GAAP, we use adjusted income, a non-GAAP financial measure, to measure our operating performance. Adjusted income represents net income (loss) allocable to common shareholders, prior to the effect of depreciation and amortization, provision for (recovery of) loan losses, impairment of assets, loss on transfer of interest to unconsolidated subsidiary, stock-based compensation expense, and the non-cash portion of gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt (\"Adjusted Income\").\nWe believe Adjusted Income is a useful measure to consider, in addition to net income (loss), as it may help investors evaluate our operating performance prior to certain non-cash items. Adjusted Income should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) as shown in our consolidated statements of operations. Adjusted Income should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is Adjusted Income indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs or available for distribution to shareholders. Rather, Adjusted Income is an additional measure for us to use to analyze how our business is performing.

All non-performing loans are placed on non-accrual status and income is only recognized in certain cases upon actual cash receipt. As of December 31, 2015, we had non-performing loans with an aggregate carrying value of $60.3 million compared to non-performing loans of $65.0 million at December 31, 2014. We expect that our level of non-performing loans will fluctuate from period to period.\nReserve for Loan Losses-The reserve for loan losses was $108.2 million as of December 31, 2015, or 6.6% of total loans, compared to $98.5 million or 7.6% as of December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the provision for loan losses includes specific reserves of $34.1 million and an increase of $2.5 million in the general reserve due primarily to new investment originations. We expect that our level of reserve for loan losses will fluctuate from period to period. Due to the volatility of the commercial real estate market, the process of estimating collateral values and reserves requires the use of significant judgment. We currently believe there are adequate collateral and reserves to support the carrying values of the loans.\nThe reserve for loan losses includes an asset-specific component and a formula-based component. An asset-specific reserve is established for an impaired loan when the estimated fair value of the loan's collateral less costs to sell is lower than the carrying value of the loan. As of December 31, 2015, asset-specific reserves increased to $72.2 million compared to $65.0 million as of December 31, 2014, primarily due to one new non-performing loan.\nThe formula-based general reserve is derived from estimated principal default probabilities and loss severities applied to groups of performing loans based upon risk ratings assigned to loans with similar risk characteristics during our quarterly loan portfolio assessment. During this assessment, we perform a comprehensive analysis of our loan portfolio and assign risk ratings to loans that incorporate management's current judgments about their credit quality based on all known and relevant factors that may affect collectability. We consider, among other things, payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. This methodology results in loans being segmented by risk classification into risk rating categories that are associated with estimated probabilities of default and principal loss. We estimate loss rates based on historical realized losses experienced within our portfolio and take into account current economic conditions affecting the commercial real estate market when establishing appropriate time frames to evaluate loss experience.\nThe general reserve increased to $36.0 million or 2.4% of performing loans as of December 31, 2015, compared to $33.5 million or 2.9% of performing loans as of December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the balance of performing loans, which was driven by new investment originations.\nRisk concentrations-Concentrations of credit risks arise when a number of borrowers or tenants related to our investments are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to us, to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.\nSubstantially all of our real estate as well as assets collateralizing our loans receivable are located in the United States. As of December 31, 2015, the only states with a concentration greater than 10.0% were New York with 19.9% and California with 13.6%. As of that date, we also had approximately 30.3% of the carrying value of our assets related to properties located in the northeastern U.S., 17.7% related to properties located in the western U.S., 15.7% related to properties located in the southeastern U.S., 14.0% related to properties located in the mid-Atlantic U.S. and 10.1% related to properties located in the southwestern region of the U.S. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had $18.6 million of international assets. As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio contains concentrations in the following asset types: land 22.7%, office/industrial 22.5%, mixed use/mixed collateral 15.8% and hotel 10.6%. Additional information regarding property/collateral type and geographical region for each segment is in Item 1 - \"Business.\"\nWe underwrite the credit of prospective borrowers and tenants and often require them to provide some form of credit support such as corporate guarantees, letters of credit and/or cash security deposits. Although our loans and real estate assets are geographically diverse and the borrowers and tenants operate in a variety of industries, to the extent we have a significant concentration of interest or operating lease revenues from any single borrower or tenant, the inability of that borrower or tenant to make its payment could have a material adverse effect on us. As of December 31, 2015, our five largest borrowers or tenants collectively accounted for approximately 21% of our 2015 revenues, of which no single customer accounts for more than 6%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we committed to new investments totaling $756.9 million. We funded a total of $662.5 million associated with new investments, prior financing commitments as well as ongoing development during the year. The fundings included $479.6 million in lending and other investments, $95.3 million to develop our land assets and $87.6 million of capital to reposition or redevelop our operating properties and invest in net lease assets. Also during the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated $1.0 billion of proceeds from loan repayments and asset sales within our portfolio, comprised of $454.8 million from real estate finance, $283.8 million from operating properties, $102.3 million from net lease assets, $98.1 million from land and development assets and $32.2 million from other investments. These amounts are inclusive of fundings and proceeds from both consolidated investments and our pro rata share from equity method investments. As of December 31, 2015, we had unrestricted cash of $711.1 million.\nThe following table outlines our capital expenditures on real estate and land and development assets as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, by segment ($ in thousands):\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Properties\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Lease\n</td> <td>6,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures on real estate assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land and Development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures on land and development assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur primary cash uses over the next 12 months are expected to be funding of investments, repayments of debt, capital expenditures and funding ongoing business operations. We repaid the $105.8 million outstanding balance of our 6.05% senior notes due April 2015 at their maturity. We have other debt maturities of $926.4 million due before December 31, 2016. Over the next 12 months, we currently expect to fund in the range of approximately $225 million to $300 million of capital expenditures within our portfolio. The majority of these amounts relate to our land and development and operating properties business segments and include multifamily and residential development activities which are expected to include approximately $130 million in vertical construction. The amount spent will depend on the pace of our development activities as well as the extent to which we strategically partner with others to complete these projects. As of December 31, 2015, we also had approximately $779 million of maximum unfunded commitments associated with our investments of which we expect to fund the majority of over the next two years, assuming borrowers and tenants meet all milestones and performance hurdles and all other conditions to fundings are met. See \"Unfunded Commitments\" below. Our capital sources to meet cash uses through the next 12 months and beyond will primarily be expected to include cash on hand, income from our portfolio, loan repayments from borrowers, proceeds from asset sales and capital raised through debt and/or equity capital raising transactions.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the specific transactions we will undertake to generate sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations as they come due. We will adjust our plans as appropriate in response to changes in our expectations and changes in market conditions. While economic trends have stabilized, it is not possible for us to predict whether these trends will continue or to quantify the impact of these or other trends on our financial results.\nContractual Obligations-The following table outlines the contractual obligations related to our long-term debt obligations, loan participations payable and operating lease obligations as of December 31, 2015 (see Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data-Note 10\").\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amounts Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 - 10\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 10\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,221,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>926,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,524,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>770,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured credit facilities\n</td> <td>339,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>339,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured term loans\n</td> <td>239,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other debt obligations\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total principal maturities\n</td> <td>4,150,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>935,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,141,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>809,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Payable(1)\n</td> <td>546,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>243,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan Participations Payable(2)\n</td> <td>153,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td>26,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>728\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,876,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,138,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,494,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>938,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Variable-rate debt assumes 1-month LIBOR of 0.42% and 3-month LIBOR of 0.32% that were in effect as of December 31, 2015. \n (2) Refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. \n (3) We also have issued letters of credit totaling $2.2 million in connection with our investments. See \"Unfunded Commitments\" below, for a discussion of certain unfunded commitments related to our lending and net lease businesses. \n2015 Revolving Credit Facility-On March 27, 2015, we entered into our 2015 Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest at a floating rate indexed to one of several base rates plus a margin which adjusts upward or downward based upon our corporate credit rating. An undrawn credit facility commitment fee ranges from 0.375% to 0.50%, based on average utilization each quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the weighted average cost of the credit facility was 3.13%. Commitments under the revolving facility mature in March 2018. At maturity, we may convert outstanding borrowings to a one year term loan which matures in quarterly installments through March 2019.\n2012 Secured Credit Facilities-In March 2012, we entered into an $880.0 million senior secured credit agreement providing for two tranches of term loans: a $410.0 million 2012 A-1 tranche due March 2016, which bore interest at a rate of LIBOR + 4.00% (the \"2012 Tranche A-1 Facility\"), and a $470.0 million 2012 A-2 tranche due March 2017, which bears interest at a rate of LIBOR + 5.75% (the \"2012 Tranche A-2 Facility,\" together the \"2012 Secured Credit Facilities\"). The 2012 A-1 and A-2 tranches were issued at 98.0% of par and 98.5% of par, respectively, and both tranches include a LIBOR floor of 1.25%. Proceeds from the 2012 Secured Credit Facilities, together with cash on hand, were used to repurchase and repay other outstanding debt.\nThe 2012 Secured Credit Facilities are collateralized by a first lien on a fixed pool of assets. Proceeds from principal repayments and sales of collateral are applied to amortize the 2012 Secured Credit Facilities. Proceeds received for interest, rent, lease payments and fee income are retained by us. We may also make optional prepayments, subject to prepayment fees. The 2012 Tranche A-1 Facility was fully repaid in August 2013. Additionally, through December 31, 2015, we made cumulative amortization repayments of $130.3 million on the 2012 Tranche A-2 Facility. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, repayments of the 2012 Tranche A-2 Facility prior to maturity resulted in losses on early extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively, related to the accelerated amortization of discounts and unamortized deferred financing fees on the portion of the facility that was repaid. For the year ended December 31, 2013, repayments of the 2012 Tranche A-1 Facility prior to scheduled amortization dates resulted in losses on early extinguishment of debt of $4.4 million. These amounts are included in \"Loss on early extinguishment of debt, net\" in our consolidated statements of operations.\nUnsecured Notes-In June 2014, we issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured notes due November 2017 and $770.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior unsecured notes due July 2019. Net proceeds from these transactions, together with cash on hand, were used to fully repay and terminate the February 2013 Secured Credit Facility which had an outstanding balance of $1.32 billion.\nEncumbered/Unencumbered Assets-As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the carrying value of our encumbered and unencumbered assets by asset type are as follows ($ in thousands):\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Encumbered Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unencumbered Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Encumbered Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unencumbered Assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>816,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>777,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>602,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,213,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate available and held for sale\n</td> <td>10,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land and development\n</td> <td>17,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>984,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>961,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans receivable and other lending investments, net(1)(2)\n</td> <td>170,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,314,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,364,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments\n</td> <td>22,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>336,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and other assets\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,033,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>768,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,037,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,468,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>695,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,801,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________________________________\n (1) As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the amounts presented exclude general reserves for loan losses of $36.0 million and $33.5 million, respectively. \n (2) As of December 31, 2015, the amount presented excludes loan participations of $153.0 million. \nDebt Covenants\nOur outstanding unsecured debt securities contain corporate level covenants that include a covenant to maintain a ratio of unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness of at least 1.2x and a covenant not to incur additional indebtedness (except for incurrences of permitted debt), if on a pro forma basis, our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, determined in accordance with the indentures governing our debt securities, is 1.5x or lower. If any of our covenants are breached and not cured within applicable cure periods, the breach could result in acceleration of our debt securities unless a waiver or modification is agreed upon with the requisite percentage of the bondholders. While our ability to incur additional indebtedness under the fixed charge coverage ratio is currently limited, we are permitted to incur indebtedness for the purpose of refinancing existing indebtedness and for other permitted purposes under the indentures.\nThe 2012 Secured Credit Facilities and the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility contain certain covenants, including covenants relating to collateral coverage, dividend payments, restrictions on fundamental changes, transactions with affiliates, matters relating to the liens granted to the lenders and the delivery of information to the lenders. In particular, the 2012 Secured Credit Facilities require us to maintain collateral coverage of at least 1.25x outstanding borrowings on the facilities. The 2015 Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a borrowing base of assets and requires us to maintain both collateral coverage of at least 1.5x outstanding borrowings on the facility and a consolidated ratio of cash flow to fixed charges of at least 1.5x. The 2015 Revolving Credit Facility does not require that proceeds from the borrowing base be used to pay down outstanding borrowings provided the collateral coverage remains at least 1.5x outstanding borrowings on the facility. To satisfy this covenant, we have the option to pay down outstanding borrowings or substitute assets in the borrowing base. In addition, for so long as we maintain our qualification as a REIT, the 2012 Secured Credit Facilities and the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility permit us to distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis (prior to deducting certain cumulative NOL carryforwards in the case of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility). We may not pay common dividends if we cease to qualify as a REIT.\nThe 2012 Secured Credit Facilities and the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility contain cross default provisions that would allow the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate our indebtedness to them if we fail to pay amounts due in respect of our other recourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds or if the lenders under such other indebtedness are otherwise permitted to accelerate such indebtedness for any reason. The indentures governing our unsecured public debt securities permit the bondholders to declare an event of default and accelerate our indebtedness to them if our other recourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds is not paid at final maturity or if such indebtedness is accelerated.\nDerivatives-Our use of derivative financial instruments is primarily limited to the utilization of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps or other instruments to manage interest rate risk exposure and foreign exchange contracts to manage our risk to changes in foreign currencies. See Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data-Note 12\" for further details.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements-We are not dependent on the use of any off-balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity. We have made investments in various unconsolidated ventures. See Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data-Note 7\" for further details of our unconsolidated investments. Our maximum exposure to loss from these investments is limited to the carrying value of our investments and any unfunded commitments (see below).\nUnfunded Commitments-We generally fund construction and development loans and build-outs of space in net lease assets over a period of time if and when the borrowers and tenants meet established milestones and other performance criteria. We refer to these arrangements as Performance-Based Commitments. In addition, we sometimes establish a maximum amount of additional funding which we will make available to a borrower or tenant for an expansion or addition to a project if we approve of the expansion or addition in our sole discretion. We refer to these arrangements as Discretionary Fundings. Finally, we have committed to invest capital in several real estate funds and other ventures. These arrangements are referred to as Strategic Investments. As of December 31, 2015, the maximum amounts of the fundings we may make under each category, assuming all performance hurdles and milestones are met under the Performance-Based Commitments, that we approve all Discretionary Fundings and that 100% of our capital committed to Strategic Investments is drawn down, are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Loans and Other Lending Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Real Estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\nInvestments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance-Based Commitments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>689,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>728,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic Investments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discretionary Fundings\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>694,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>778,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock Repurchase Program-In September 2015, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the repurchase limit under our previously approved stock repurchase program to $50.0 million. In December 2015, after having substantially utilized the availability approved in September 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a new $50.0 million repurchase program. The program authorizes the repurchase of common stock from time to time in open market and privately negotiated purchases, including pursuant to one or more trading plans. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 5.7 million shares of our common stock for $70.4 million, at an average cost of $12.25 per share. There were no stock repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $48.7 million of common stock under our stock repurchase program. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we repurchased 5.2 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $52.0 million, at an average cost of $10.10 per share. In February 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new $50.0 million repurchase program.\nHPU Repurchase-In August 2015, we repurchased and retired all of our outstanding 14,888 HPUs, representing 2.8 million common stock equivalents. We repurchased these HPUs at fair value from current and former employees through an arms-length exchange offer. HPU holders could elect to receive $9.30 in cash or 0.7 shares of iStar common stock, or a combination thereof, per common stock equivalent underlying the HPUs. Approximately 37% of the outstanding HPUs were exchanged for $9.8 million in cash and approximately 63% of the outstanding HPUs were exchanged for 1.2 million shares of our common stock with a fair value of $15.2 million, representing the number of shares issued at the closing price of our common stock on August 13, 2015. The transaction value in excess of the HPUs carrying value of $9.8 million was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings (deficit) in our consolidated statements of changes in equity.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported as assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well controlled, reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. We base our estimates on historical corporate and industry experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and, therefore, routinely require adjustment.\nDuring 2015, management reviewed and evaluated these critical accounting estimates and believes they are appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are described in Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data-Note 3.\" The following is a summary of accounting policies that require more significant management estimates and judgments:\nReserve for loan losses-The reserve for loan losses reflects management's estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. If we determine that the collateral fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying value of a collateral-dependent loan, we will record a reserve. The reserve is increased (decreased) through \"Provision for (recovery of) loan losses\" in our consolidated statements of operations and is decreased by charge-offs. During delinquency and the foreclosure process, there are typically numerous points of negotiation with the borrower as we work toward a settlement or other alternative resolution, which can impact the potential for loan repayment or receipt of collateral. Our policy is to charge off a loan when we determine, based on a variety of factors, that all commercially reasonable means of recovering the loan balance have been exhausted. This may occur at different times, including when we receive cash or other assets in a pre-foreclosure sale or take control of the underlying collateral in full satisfaction of the loan upon foreclosure or deed-in-lieu, or when we have otherwise ceased significant\ncollection efforts. We consider circumstances such as the foregoing to be indicators that the final steps in the loan collection process have occurred and that a loan is uncollectible. At this point, a loss is confirmed and the loan and related reserve will be charged off. We have one portfolio segment, represented by commercial real estate lending, whereby we utilize a uniform process for determining our reserves for loan losses. The reserve for loan losses includes a general, formula-based component and an asset-specific component.\nThe general reserve component covers performing loans and reserves for loan losses are recorded when (i) available information as of each balance sheet date indicates that it is probable a loss has occurred in the portfolio and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The formula-based general reserve is derived from estimated principal default probabilities and loss severities applied to groups of loans based upon risk ratings assigned to loans with similar risk characteristics during our quarterly loan portfolio assessment. During this assessment, we perform a comprehensive analysis of our loan portfolio and assign risk ratings to loans that incorporate management's current judgments about their credit quality based on all known and relevant internal and external factors that may affect collectability. We consider, among other things, payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. This methodology results in loans being segmented by risk classification into risk rating categories that are associated with estimated probabilities of default and principal loss. Ratings range from \"1\" to \"5\" with \"1\" representing the lowest risk of loss and \"5\" representing the highest risk of loss. We estimate loss rates based on historical realized losses experienced within our portfolio and take into account current economic conditions affecting the commercial real estate market when establishing appropriate time frames to evaluate loss experience.\nThe asset-specific reserve component relates to reserves for losses on impaired loans. We consider a loan to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, we believe that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. This assessment is made on a loan-by-loan basis each quarter based on such factors as payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. A reserve is established for an impaired loan when the present value of payments expected to be received, observable market prices, or the estimated fair value of the collateral (for loans that are dependent on the collateral for repayment) is lower than the carrying value of that loan.\nSubstantially all of our impaired loans are collateral dependent and impairment is measured using the estimated fair value of collateral, less costs to sell. We generally use the income approach through internally developed valuation models to estimate the fair value of the collateral for such loans. In more limited cases, we obtain external \"as is\" appraisals for loan collateral, generally when third party participations exist. Valuations are performed or obtained at the time a loan is determined to be impaired and designated non-performing, and they are updated if circumstances indicate that a significant change in value has occurred. In limited cases, appraised values may be discounted when real estate markets rapidly deteriorate.\nA loan is also considered impaired if its terms are modified in a troubled debt restructuring (\"TDR\"). A TDR occurs when we grant a concession to a debtor that is experiencing financial difficulties. Impairments on TDR loans are generally measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the original loan.\nThe provision for (recovery of) loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $36.6 million, $(1.7) million and $5.5 million, respectively. The total reserve for loan losses as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, included asset specific reserves of $72.2 million and $65.0 million, respectively, and general reserves of $36.0 million and $33.5 million, respectively.\nAcquisition of real estate-We generally acquire real estate assets or land and development assets through purchases or through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in full or partial satisfaction of non-performing loans. When we acquire assets these properties are classified as \"Real estate, net\" or \"Land and development\" on our consolidated balance sheets. When we intend to hold, operate or develop the property for a period of at least 12 months, assets are classified as \"Real estate, net,\" and when we intend to market these properties for sale in the near term, assets are classified as \"Real estate available and held for sale.\" When we purchase assets the properties are recorded at cost. Foreclosed assets classified as real estate and land and development are initially recorded at their estimated fair value and assets classified as assets held for sale are recorded at their estimated fair value less costs to sell. The excess of the carrying value of the loan over these amounts is charged-off against the reserve for loan losses. In both cases, upon acquisition, tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their estimated fair values.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we received title to properties in satisfaction of mortgage loans with fair values of $13.4 million, $77.9 million and $31.1 million, respectively, for which those properties had served as collateral.\nImpairment or disposal of long-lived assets-Real estate assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell and are included in \"Real estate available and held for sale\" on our consolidated balance sheets. The difference between the estimated fair value less costs to sell and the carrying value will be recorded as an impairment charge. Impairment for real estate assets disposed of or classified as held for sale on or before December 31, 2013 are\nincluded in \"Income (loss) from discontinued operations\" in our consolidated statements of operations. Impairment for real estate assets disposed of or classified as held for sale after December 31, 2013 are included in \"Impairment of assets\" in our consolidated statements of operations. Once the asset is classified as held for sale, depreciation expense is no longer recorded and historical operating results are reclassified to \"Income (loss) from discontinued operations\" in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe periodically review real estate to be held and used and land and development assets for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The asset's value is impaired only if management's estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the asset (taking into account the anticipated holding period of the asset) is less than the carrying value. Such estimate of cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the asset and reflected as an adjustment to the basis of the asset. Impairments of real estate and land and development assets are recorded in \"Impairment of assets\" in our consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded impairments on real estate and land and development assets totaling $10.5 million resulting from a change in business strategy and unfavorable local market conditions for certain assets. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded impairments on real estate and land and development assets totaling $34.6 million and $14.4 million, respectively, resulting from unfavorable local market conditions and changes in business strategy for certain assets. Of these amounts, $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 has been recorded in \"Income (loss) from discontinued operations\" in our consolidated statements of operations due to the assets being disposed of or classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2013.\nIdentified intangible assets and liabilities-We record intangible assets and liabilities acquired at their estimated fair values, and determine whether such intangible assets and liabilities have finite or indefinite lives. As of December 31, 2015, all such acquired intangible assets and liabilities have finite lives. We amortize finite lived intangible assets and liabilities over the period which the assets and liabilities are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired. We review finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If we determine the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable we will record an impairment charge to the extent its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Impairments of intangibles are recorded in \"Impairment of assets\" in our consolidated statements of operations.\nValuation of deferred tax assets-Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. When evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider, among other matters, estimates of expected future taxable income, nature of current and cumulative losses, existing and projected book/tax differences, tax planning strategies available, and the general and industry specific economic outlook. This realizability analysis is inherently subjective, as it requires us to forecast our business and general economic environment in future periods. Changes in estimate of deferred tax asset realizability, if any are included in \"Income tax (expense) benefit\" in the consolidated statements of operations.\nWhile certain entities with NOLs may generate profits in the future, which may allow us to utilize the NOLs, we continue to record a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset due to the history of losses and the uncertainty of the entities' ability to generate such profits. We recorded a full valuation allowance of $53.9 million and $54.3 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nVariable interest entities-We evaluate our investments and other contractual arrangements to determine if our interests constitute variable interests in a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") and if we are the primary beneficiary. There is a significant amount of judgment required to determine if an entity is considered a VIE and if we are the primary beneficiary. We first perform a qualitative analysis, which requires certain subjective decisions regarding our assessment, including, but not limited to, which interests create or absorb variability, the contractual terms, the key decision making powers, impact on the VIE's economic performance and related party relationships. An iterative quantitative analysis is required if our qualitative analysis proves inconclusive as to whether the entity is a VIE or we are the primary beneficiary and consolidation is required.\nFair value of assets and liabilities-The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities\ncould result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement.\nSee Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data-Note 16\" for a complete discussion on how we determine fair value of financial and non-financial assets and financial liabilities and the related measurement techniques and estimates involved.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCertain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.

For purposes of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the terms \"we,\" \"our\" and \"us\" refer to iStar Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.\nThis discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity during the three-year period ended December 31, 2015. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes for the three-year period ended December 31, 2015 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified in the Company's consolidated financial statements and the related notes to conform to the current period presentation.\nIntroduction\niStar Inc., doing business as \"iStar,\" finances, invests in and develops real estate and real estate related projects as part of its fully-integrated investment platform. We have invested more than $35 billion over the past two decades and are structured as a REIT with a diversified portfolio focused on larger assets located in major metropolitan markets. Our primary business segments are real estate finance, net lease, operating properties and land and development.\nOur real estate finance portfolio is comprised of senior and mezzanine real estate loans that may be either fixed-rate or variable-rate and are structured to meet the specific financing needs of borrowers. Our portfolio also includes preferred equity investments and senior and subordinated loans to business entities, particularly entities engaged in real estate or real estate related businesses, and may be either secured or unsecured. Our loan portfolio includes whole loans and loan participations.\nOur net lease portfolio is primarily comprised of properties owned by us and leased to single creditworthy tenants where the properties are subject to long-term leases. Most of the leases provide for expenses at the facilities to be paid by the tenants on a triple net lease basis. The properties in this portfolio are diversified by property type and geographic location. In 2014, the Company partnered with a sovereign wealth fund to form a venture in which the partners plan to contribute equity to acquire and develop net lease assets.\nOur operating properties portfolio is comprised of commercial and residential properties which represent a diverse pool of assets across a broad range of geographies and property types. We generally seek to reposition or redevelop these assets with the objective of maximizing their value through the infusion of capital and/or intensive asset management efforts. The commercial properties within this portfolio include office, retail, hotel and other property types. The residential properties within this portfolio are generally luxury condominium projects located in major U.S. cities where our strategy is to sell individual units through retail distribution channels.\nOur land and development portfolio is primarily comprised of land entitled for master planned communities as well as waterfront and urban infill land parcels located throughout the U.S. Master planned communities represent large-scale residential projects that we will entitle, plan and/or develop and may sell through retail channels to home builders or in bulk. Waterfront parcels are generally entitled for residential projects and urban infill parcels are generally entitled for mixed-use projects. We may develop these properties ourself or sell to or partner with commercial real estate developers.\nExecutive Overview\nWe have continued to originate investments within our core business segments of real estate finance and net lease, which we anticipate should drive future revenue growth. In addition, we have made significant investments within our operating property and land and development portfolios in order to better position assets for sale. Through strategic ventures, we have partnered with other providers of capital within our net lease segment and with developers with residential building expertise within our land and development segment. These partnerships have had a positive impact on our business, particularly in our land and development segment, which experienced an increase in revenue in 2015.\nAccess to the capital markets has allowed us to extend our debt maturity profile, lower our cost of capital and become primarily an unsecured borrower. In 2015, we entered into the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility with a maximum capacity of $250.0 million. In 2014, we fully repaid our largest secured credit facility using proceeds from unsecured notes issuances. This repayment unencumbered $2.0 billion of collateral and provides us with additional liquidity as we now retain 100% of the proceeds from sales and repayments of these previously encumbered assets, rather than directing them to repay the facility. As of December 31, 2015, we had $711.1 million of cash, which we expect to use primarily to fund future investment activities, pay down debt, and for general corporate purposes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, three of our four business segments, including real estate finance, net lease and operating properties, contributed positively to our earnings. We continue to work on repositioning or redeveloping our transitional operating properties and progressing on the entitlement and development of our land and development assets in order to maximize their value. We intend to continue these efforts, with the objective of having these assets contribute positively to earnings in the future. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a net loss allocable to common shareholders of $52.7 million, compared to a net loss of $33.7 million during the prior year. Adjusted income allocable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $84.0 million, compared to $109.4 million during the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $62.8 million less in equity method earnings than we did in the prior year, primarily associated with the sales of certain investments in 2014. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in total gross margin from our land and development portfolio, which improved to $49.5 million in 2015 from $17.3 million in 2014.\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\n\nRevenue-Operating lease income, which primarily includes income from net lease assets and commercial operating properties, decreased to $229.7 million in 2015 from $243.1 million in 2014.\nOperating lease income from net lease assets decreased slightly to $151.5 million in 2015 from $151.9 million in 2014. The net lease portfolio generated an unleveraged yield of 7.8% for 2015 as compared to 7.9% for 2014 as rental rates for new leases were lower than rental rates for leases that terminated since December 31, 2014. The decrease in operating lease income was driven primarily by a decrease related to asset sales offset by an increase in operating lease income from same store net lease assets. Operating lease income for same store net lease assets, defined as net lease assets we owned on or prior to January 1, 2014 and were in service through December 31, 2015, increased to $140.3 million in 2015 from $137.3 million in 2014 due primarily to an increase in rent per occupied square foot, which was $9.84 for 2015 and $9.56 for 2014, and an increase in the occupancy rate, which was 95.7% as of December 31, 2015 and 95.0% as of December 31, 2014.\nOperating lease income from commercial operating properties decreased to $77.0 million in 2015 from $87.7 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of a leasehold interest in an operating property and other asset sales, partially offset by additional income in 2015 for three commercial operating properties acquired in 2014 and an increase in leasing activity at other properties. Operating lease income for same store commercial operating properties, defined as commercial operating properties, excluding hotels, we owned on or prior to January 1, 2014 and were in service through December 31, 2015, increased to $60.7 million in 2015 from $56.8 million in 2014 due primarily to an increase in occupancy rates, which increased to 74.7% as of December 31, 2015 from 68.2% as of December 31, 2014. The increase was partially offset by a decline in rent per occupied square foot for same store commercial operating properties, which was $21.64 for 2015 and $23.01 for 2014. Ancillary operating lease income for residential operating properties and land and development assets decreased to $1.2 million in 2015 from $3.5 million in 2014.\nInterest income increased to $134.7 million in 2015 as compared to $122.7 million in 2014 due primarily to an increase in the size of the loan portfolio, partially offset by $6.3 million of income recognized in 2014 from the acquisition and repayment of a loan. New investment originations and additional fundings on existing loans raised our average balance of performing loans to $1.52 billion for 2015 from $1.27 billion for 2014. The weighted average yield of our performing loans decreased to 8.8% for\n2015 from 9.1% for 2014, excluding $6.3 million of income recognized from the acquisition and repayment of a loan, due primarily to lower interest rates on loan originations in 2015 and payoffs of loans with higher interest rates.\nOther income decreased to $49.9 million in 2015 as compared to $81.0 million in 2014. The decrease in 2015 was due to gains on sales of non-performing loans of $19.1 million, income related to a lease modification fee of $5.3 million and income related to an early termination fee of $3.4 million all recognized in 2014. The decrease was partially offset by a $5.5 million financing commitment termination fee recognized in 2015.\nLand development revenue and cost of sales-In 2015, we sold residential lots, units and parcels for proceeds of $100.2 million which had associated cost of sales of $67.4 million. In 2014, we sold residential lots and units for proceeds of $15.2 million which had associated cost of sales of $12.8 million. The increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the progression of our land and development projects in 2015, including the sale of two land parcels for land development revenue of $62.8 million resulting in a gross margin of $24.2 million.\nCosts and expenses-Interest expense remained constant at $224.6 million in 2015 as compared to $224.5 million in 2014. This was due to a higher average outstanding debt balance offset by a lower weighted average cost of debt. The average outstanding balance of our debt increased to $4.18 billion for 2015 from $4.08 billion for 2014. Our weighted average cost of debt decreased to 5.4% for 2015 from 5.5% for 2014.\nReal estate expenses decreased to $146.8 million in 2015 as compared to $163.4 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily related to expenses associated with residential units, which decreased to $14.2 million in 2015 from $25.6 million in 2014 due to unit sales. The decrease was also related to a decline in expenses for commercial operating properties to $81.7 million in 2015 from $87.9 million in 2014 which was primarily due to the sale of operating properties in 2015 and late 2014. Expenses for same store commercial operating properties, excluding hotels, increased slightly to $39.7 million from $39.2 million in 2015. Expenses for net lease assets decreased to $21.9 million in 2015 from $23.0 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to asset sales during 2014. Expenses for same store net lease assets increased to $20.2 million in 2015 from $19.9 million for 2014. Carry costs and other expenses on our land and development assets increased to $29.0 million in 2015 as compared to $26.9 million in 2014, primarily related to an increase in costs incurred on certain land and development projects and an increase in marketing costs.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased to $65.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 from $73.6 million for the same period in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of a leasehold interest in an operating property and other asset sales in 2015 and accelerated depreciation related to terminated leases during 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased to $81.3 million in 2015 as compared to $88.3 million in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in compensation related costs pertaining to annual performance based bonuses.\nThe net provision for loan losses was $36.6 million in 2015 as compared to a net recovery of loan losses of $1.7 million in 2014. Included in the net provision for 2015 were provisions for specific reserves of $34.1 million due primarily to one new non-performing loan and an increase in the general reserve of $2.5 million due primarily to new investment originations. Included in the net recovery for 2014 were recoveries of previously recorded loan loss reserves of $10.1 million, provisions for specific reserves of $4.1 million and an increase of $4.3 million in the general reserve due primarily to new investment originations.\nIn 2015, we recorded impairments on real estate assets totaling $10.5 million resulting from a change in business strategy on one land and development asset and two commercial operating properties and unfavorable local market conditions for one residential property. In 2014, we recorded impairments on real estate assets totaling $34.6 million resulting from changes in business strategies for one residential property and one land and development asset, continued unfavorable local market conditions at two real estate properties and the sale of net lease assets.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt, net-In 2015 and 2014, we incurred losses on early extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million and $25.4 million, respectively. In 2015, net losses on the early extinguishment of debt related to accelerated amortization of discounts and fees in connection with amortization payments of our 2012 Secured Credit Facilities. In 2014, together with cash on hand, net proceeds from the 2014 issuances of our 4.00% senior unsecured notes due November 2017 and our 5.00% senior unsecured notes due July 2019 were used to fully repay and terminate our secured credit facility entered into in February 2013. As a result, in 2014, we expensed $22.8 million relating to accelerated amortization of discount and fees associated with the payoff of that secured credit facility. We also recorded $2.6 million of losses in 2014 related to the accelerated amortization of discounts and fees in connection with amortization payments that we made on our secured credit facilities.\nEarnings from equity method investments-Earnings from equity method investments decreased to $32.2 million in 2015 as compared to $94.9 million in 2014. In 2015, we recognized $23.6 million related to sales activity on a land development venture, $5.2 million related to leasing operations at our Net Lease Venture and an aggregate $3.4 million in earnings from our remaining\nequity method investments. In 2014, we recognized $56.8 million of income resulting from asset sales by two of our equity method investees and a legal settlement received by one of the investees. We also recognized $14.7 million of earnings related to sales activity on a land and development venture, $9.0 million of income related to carried interest from a previously held strategic investment and an aggregate $14.4 million related to earnings from our remaining equity method investments.\nIncome tax (expense) benefit-Income taxes are primarily generated by assets held in our TRS. Income tax expense increased to $7.6 million in 2015 as compared to $3.9 million in 2014. The increase in current income tax expense relates primarily to taxable income generated by the sales of TRS properties.\nIncome from sales of real estate-Income from sales of real estate increased to $93.8 million in 2015 from $89.9 million in 2014. In 2015, we sold 12 net lease assets resulting in gains of $40.1 million. We also sold a commercial operating property for $68.5 million to a newly formed unconsolidated entity in which we own a 50% equity interest and recognized a gain on sale of $13.6 million, reflecting our share of the interest sold. In 2015 and 2014, we sold residential condominiums that resulted in income of $40.1 million and $79.1 million, respectively. In 2014, we sold net lease assets with a carrying value of $8.0 million resulting in a gain of $6.2 million and a commercial operating property with a carrying value of $29.4 million resulting in a gain of $4.6 million.\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\n\nRevenue-Operating lease income, which primarily includes income from net lease assets and commercial operating properties, increased to $243.1 million in 2014 from $234.6 million in 2013.\nOperating lease income from net lease assets increased to $151.9 million in 2014 from $147.3 million in 2013. The net lease portfolio generated an unleveraged yield of 7.9% for 2014 as compared to 7.2% for 2013 as rental rates for new leases were greater than rental rates for leases that terminated since December 31, 2013. Operating lease income for same store net lease assets, defined as net lease assets we owned on or prior to January 1, 2013 and were in service through December 31, 2014, increased to $148.3 million in 2014 from $146.2 million in 2013 due primarily to an increase in rent per occupied square foot for same store net lease assets, which was $9.86 for 2014 as compared to $9.62 for 2013. The increase in operating lease income was also due to higher occupancy rates for same store net lease assets, which was 95.2% as of December 31, 2014 as compared to 93.0% as of December 31, 2013. We had two net lease assets which were sold to our Net Lease Venture in 2014 that, prior to their sale, contributed an additional $2.0 million of operating lease income in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nOperating lease income from commercial operating properties increased to $87.7 million in 2014 from $86.4 million in 2013 as rental rates for new leases were greater than leases that terminated since December 31, 2013. Operating lease income for same store commercial operating properties, defined as commercial operating properties, excluding hotels, we owned on or prior to January 1, 2013 and were in service through December 31, 2014, decreased to $81.6 million in 2014 from $84.9 million in 2013 due primarily to a decline in rent per occupied square foot for same store commercial operating properties, which was $24.52 for 2014 and $26.06 for 2013. The decline was partially offset by an increase in occupancy rates for same store commercial operating properties, which increased to 65.0% as of December 31, 2014 from 62.8% as of December 31, 2013. In addition, we acquired title to additional commercial operating properties in 2014, which contributed $4.5 million to operating lease income in 2014. Ancillary operating lease income for residential operating properties increased $2.6 million in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nInterest income increased to $122.7 million in 2014 as compared to $108.0 million in 2013 due primarily to increases in the volume and interest rates of performing loans. New investment originations and additional fundings of existing loans raised our average balance of performing loans to $1.27 billion for 2014 from $1.23 billion for 2013. The weighted average yield of our performing loans increased to 9.1%, excluding $6.3 million of income recognized from the acquisition and repayment of a loan, for 2014 from 7.6% for 2013 due primarily to higher interest rates for new loan originations in 2014 and payoffs of loans with lower interest rates.\nOther income increased to $81.0 million in 2014 as compared to $48.2 million in 2013. The increase was due to gains on sales of non-performing loans of $19.1 million as well as $16.5 million of income related to asset related settlements, $3.8 million of ancillary income from properties acquired in 2014 and $2.3 million of prior year tax refunds. The increases were offset in part by a decline of $7.2 million due primarily to the conversion of hotel rooms to residential units to be sold at a property and $4.0 million received for the settlement of a property-related lawsuit in 2013.\nLand development revenue and cost of sales-In 2014, we sold residential lots and units from three of our master planned community properties for proceeds of $15.2 million which had associated cost of sales of $12.8 million.\nCosts and expenses-Interest expense decreased to $224.5 million in 2014 as compared to $266.2 million in 2013 due to a lower average outstanding debt balance and a lower weighted average cost of debt. The average outstanding balance of our debt declined to $4.08 billion for 2014 from $4.46 billion for 2013. Our weighted average effective cost of debt decreased to 5.5% for 2014 from 5.9% for 2013. The decline was primarily a result of the refinancing of higher interest rate senior unsecured notes with lower interest rate senior unsecured notes during 2013.\nReal estate expenses increased to $163.4 million in 2014 as compared to $157.4 million in 2013. Expenses for commercial operating properties increased to $87.9 million in 2014 from $81.1 million in 2013. In 2014, expenses for same store commercial operating properties, excluding hotels, increased to $53.3 million from $51.7 million in 2013 due primarily to higher operating expenses at two properties. We acquired title to additional commercial operating properties in 2014, which contributed $9.2 million to real estate expenses in 2014. Additionally, expenses for hotel properties decreased to $22.7 million in 2014 from $28.5 million in 2013 due primarily to the conversion of hotel rooms to residential units being sold at a hotel property. Costs associated with residential units increased to $25.6 million in 2014 from $19.8 million in 2013 due to sales assessments at one of our residential properties and carrying costs for additional residential units where construction was completed, offset by a reduction of expenses due to the sale of residential units since December 31, 2013. Carry costs and other expenses on our land and development assets decreased to $26.9 million in 2014 as compared to $33.8 million in 2013, primarily related to a decrease in costs incurred on certain land and development assets prior to development.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased to $88.3 million in 2014 as compared to $92.1 million in 2013, primarily due to a reduction in stock-based compensation expense, based on certain previously issued awards becoming fully amortized in 2013.\nThe net recovery of loan losses was $1.7 million in 2014 as compared to a net provision for loan losses of $5.5 million in 2013. Included in the net recovery for 2014 were recoveries of previously recorded loan loss reserves of $10.1 million, provisions for specific reserves of $4.1 million and an increase of $4.3 million in the general reserve due primarily to new investment originations. Included in the net recovery for 2013 were specific reserves of $72.5 million, which were established on non-performing loans, offset by recoveries of previously recorded loan loss reserves of $63.1 million during the year.\nIn 2014, we recorded impairments on real estate assets totaling $34.6 million resulting from changes in business strategies for one residential property and one land and development asset, continued unfavorable local market conditions at two real estate properties and the sale of several net lease assets. In 2013, we recorded $14.4 million of impairments on real estate assets, including $1.8 million recorded in discontinued operations, due primarily to a changes in local market conditions and a change in business strategy for one residential property.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt, net-In 2014 and 2013, we incurred losses on early extinguishment of debt of $25.4 million and $33.2 million, respectively. In 2014, together with cash on hand, net proceeds from the 2014 issuances of our 4.00% senior unsecured notes due November 2017 and our 5.00% senior unsecured notes due July 2019 were used to fully repay and terminate our secured credit facility entered into in February 2013. As a result, in 2014, we expensed $22.8 million relating to accelerated amortization of discount and fees associated with the payoff of that secured credit facility. We also recorded $2.6 million of losses related to the accelerated amortization of discounts and fees in connection with amortization payments that we made on our secured credit facilities.\nIn 2013, we incurred $7.7 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt due to the accelerated amortization of discounts and fees in connection with the refinancing of a secured credit facility. We also recorded $13.2 million of losses related to the accelerated amortization of discounts and fees in connection with amortization payments that we made on our secured credit facilities. We also redeemed our 5.95% senior unsecured notes due October 2013 and 5.70% senior unsecured notes due March 2014 prior to maturity and incurred $12.3 million of losses related to prepayment penalties and the acceleration of amortization of discounts.\nEarnings from equity method investments-Earnings from equity method investments increased to $94.9 million in 2014 as compared to $41.5 million in 2013. In 2014, we recognized $56.8 million of income resulting from asset sales by two of our equity method investees and a legal settlement received by one of the investees. We also recognized $14.7 million of earnings related to sales activity on a land development venture and $9.0 million of income related to carried interest from a previously held strategic investment. The increase was offset by $12.0 million of income primarily related to asset sales by one of our strategic investments in 2013 and the sale of our interest in LNR Property Corp. in April 2013. We had no equity in earnings from LNR during 2014 as compared to 2013 in which we recorded net equity in earnings of $14.5 million.\nLoss on transfer of interest to unconsolidated subsidiary-In 2013, we entered into a venture with a national homebuilder to jointly develop residential lots in the first phase of Spring Mountain Ranch, a 1,400-lot master planned community. We contributed the initial phase of land, which had a carrying value of $24.1 million, to the venture in exchange for a retained interest of $16.7 million, resulting in a $7.4 million loss.\nIncome tax (expense) benefit-Income taxes are primarily generated by assets held in our TRS. Income taxes increased to a net tax expense of $3.9 million in 2014 as compared to a tax benefit of $0.7 million in 2013. The period to period difference was due primarily to taxable income generated by sales of TRS properties.\nDiscontinued operations-In 2014, we adopted ASU 2014-08 (refer to Note 4), which raised the threshold for discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components that are considered strategic shifts in a company's business. There were no disposals that met this threshold during 2014. Income (loss) from discontinued operations in 2013 includes operating results from net lease assets and commercial operating properties held for sale or sold as of December 31, 2013. During 2013, we sold commercial operating properties with a total carrying value of $72.6 million, which resulted in a net gain of $18.6 million and net lease assets with a total carrying value of $18.7 million which resulted in a net gain of $2.2 million.\nIncome from sales of real estate-In 2014 and 2013, we sold residential condominiums that resulted in income of $79.1 million and $82.6 million, respectively. In 2014, we also sold net lease assets with a carrying value of $8.0 million resulting in a gain of $6.2 million and a commercial operating property with a carrying value of $29.4 million resulting in a gain of $4.6 million. In 2013, we sold land for proceeds of $36.7 million that resulted in income of $4.0 million.\nAdjusted Income\nIn addition to net income (loss) prepared in conformity with GAAP, we use adjusted income, a non-GAAP financial measure, to measure our operating performance. Adjusted income represents net income (loss) allocable to common shareholders, prior to the effect of depreciation and amortization, provision for (recovery of) loan losses, impairment of assets, loss on transfer of interest to unconsolidated subsidiary, stock-based compensation expense, and the non-cash portion of gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt (\"Adjusted Income\").\nWe believe Adjusted Income is a useful measure to consider, in addition to net income (loss), as it may help investors evaluate our operating performance prior to certain non-cash items. Adjusted Income should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) as shown in our consolidated statements of operations. Adjusted Income should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is Adjusted Income indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs or available for distribution to shareholders. Rather, Adjusted Income is an additional measure for us to use to analyze how our business is performing. It should be noted that our manner of calculating Adjusted Income may differ from the calculations of similarly-titled measures by other companies.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, depreciation and amortization includes $264, $2,016 and $5,837, respectively, of depreciation and amortization reclassified to discontinued operations. Depreciation and amortization also includes our proportionate share of depreciation and amortization expense for equity method investments and excludes the portion of depreciation and amortization expense allocable to noncontrolling interests. \n (2) For the year ended December 31, 2015, impairment of assets includes impairments on cost and equity method investments recorded in \"Other income\" and \"Earnings from equity method investments\", respectively, in our consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, impairment of assets includes $1,764, $22,576 and $9,147, respectively, of impairment of assets reclassified to discontinued operations. \n (3) For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, loss on early extinguishment of debt excludes the portion of losses paid in cash of $13,535 and $15,411, respectively. \nRisk Management\nLoan Credit Statistics-The table below summarizes our non-performing loans and the reserves for loan losses associated with our loans ($ in thousands):\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, carrying values of non-performing loans are net of asset-specific reserves for loan losses of $72.2 million and $64.2 million, respectively. \nNon-Performing Loans-We designate loans as non-performing at such time as: (1) the loan becomes 90 days delinquent; (2) the loan has a maturity default; or (3) management determines it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. All non-performing loans are placed on non-accrual status and income is only recognized in certain cases upon actual cash receipt. As of December 31, 2015, we had non-performing loans with an aggregate carrying value of $60.3 million compared to non-performing loans of $65.0 million at December 31, 2014. We expect that our level of non-performing loans will fluctuate from period to period.\nReserve for Loan Losses-The reserve for loan losses was $108.2 million as of December 31, 2015, or 6.6% of total loans, compared to $98.5 million or 7.6% as of December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the provision for loan losses includes specific reserves of $34.1 million and an increase of $2.5 million in the general reserve due primarily to new investment originations. We expect that our level of reserve for loan losses will fluctuate from period to period. Due to the volatility of the commercial real estate market, the process of estimating collateral values and reserves requires the use of significant judgment. We currently believe there are adequate collateral and reserves to support the carrying values of the loans.\nThe reserve for loan losses includes an asset-specific component and a formula-based component. An asset-specific reserve is established for an impaired loan when the estimated fair value of the loan's collateral less costs to sell is lower than the carrying value of the loan. As of December 31, 2015, asset-specific reserves increased to $72.2 million compared to $65.0 million as of December 31, 2014, primarily due to one new non-performing loan.\nThe formula-based general reserve is derived from estimated principal default probabilities and loss severities applied to groups of performing loans based upon risk ratings assigned to loans with similar risk characteristics during our quarterly loan portfolio assessment. During this assessment, we perform a comprehensive analysis of our loan portfolio and assign risk ratings to loans that incorporate management's current judgments about their credit quality based on all known and relevant factors that may affect collectability. We consider, among other things, payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. This methodology results in loans being segmented by risk classification into risk rating categories that are associated with estimated probabilities of default and principal loss. We estimate loss rates based on historical realized losses experienced within our portfolio and take into account current economic conditions affecting the commercial real estate market when establishing appropriate time frames to evaluate loss experience.\nThe general reserve increased to $36.0 million or 2.4% of performing loans as of December 31, 2015, compared to $33.5 million or 2.9% of performing loans as of December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the balance of performing loans, which was driven by new investment originations.\nRisk concentrations-Concentrations of credit risks arise when a number of borrowers or tenants related to our investments are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to us, to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.\nSubstantially all of our real estate as well as assets collateralizing our loans receivable are located in the United States. As of December 31, 2015, the only states with a concentration greater than 10.0% were New York with 19.9% and California with 13.6%. As of that date, we also had approximately 30.3% of the carrying value of our assets related to properties located in the northeastern U.S., 17.7% related to properties located in the western U.S., 15.7% related to properties located in the southeastern U.S., 14.0% related to properties located in the mid-Atlantic U.S. and 10.1% related to properties located in the southwestern region of the U.S. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had $18.6 million of international assets. As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio contains concentrations in the following asset types: land 22.7%, office/industrial 22.5%, mixed use/mixed collateral 15.8% and hotel 10.6%. Additional information regarding property/collateral type and geographical region for each segment is in Item 1 - \"Business.\"\nWe underwrite the credit of prospective borrowers and tenants and often require them to provide some form of credit support such as corporate guarantees, letters of credit and/or cash security deposits. Although our loans and real estate assets are geographically diverse and the borrowers and tenants operate in a variety of industries, to the extent we have a significant concentration of interest or operating lease revenues from any single borrower or tenant, the inability of that borrower or tenant to make its payment could have a material adverse effect on us. As of December 31, 2015, our five largest borrowers or tenants collectively accounted for approximately 21% of our 2015 revenues, of which no single customer accounts for more than 6%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we committed to new investments totaling $756.9 million. We funded a total of $662.5 million associated with new investments, prior financing commitments as well as ongoing development during the year. The fundings included $479.6 million in lending and other investments, $95.3 million to develop our land assets and $87.6 million of capital to reposition or redevelop our operating properties and invest in net lease assets. Also during the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated $1.0 billion of proceeds from loan repayments and asset sales within our portfolio, comprised of $454.8 million from real estate finance, $283.8 million from operating properties, $102.3 million from net lease assets, $98.1 million from land and development assets and $32.2 million from other investments. These amounts are inclusive of fundings and proceeds from both consolidated investments and our pro rata share from equity method investments. As of December 31, 2015, we had unrestricted cash of $711.1 million.\nThe following table outlines our capital expenditures on real estate and land and development assets as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, by segment ($ in thousands):\n\nOur primary cash uses over the next 12 months are expected to be funding of investments, repayments of debt, capital expenditures and funding ongoing business operations. We repaid the $105.8 million outstanding balance of our 6.05% senior notes due April 2015 at their maturity. We have other debt maturities of $926.4 million due before December 31, 2016. Over the next 12 months, we currently expect to fund in the range of approximately $225 million to $300 million of capital expenditures within our portfolio. The majority of these amounts relate to our land and development and operating properties business segments and include multifamily and residential development activities which are expected to include approximately $130 million in vertical construction. The amount spent will depend on the pace of our development activities as well as the extent to which we strategically partner with others to complete these projects. As of December 31, 2015, we also had approximately $779 million of maximum unfunded commitments associated with our investments of which we expect to fund the majority of over the next two years, assuming borrowers and tenants meet all milestones and performance hurdles and all other conditions to fundings are met. See \"Unfunded Commitments\" below. Our capital sources to meet cash uses through the next 12 months and beyond will primarily be expected to include cash on hand, income from our portfolio, loan repayments from borrowers, proceeds from asset sales and capital raised through debt and/or equity capital raising transactions.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the specific transactions we will undertake to generate sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations as they come due. We will adjust our plans as appropriate in response to changes in our expectations and changes in market conditions. While economic trends have stabilized, it is not possible for us to predict whether these trends will continue or to quantify the impact of these or other trends on our financial results.\nContractual Obligations-The following table outlines the contractual obligations related to our long-term debt obligations, loan participations payable and operating lease obligations as of December 31, 2015 (see Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data-Note 10\").\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Variable-rate debt assumes 1-month LIBOR of 0.42% and 3-month LIBOR of 0.32% that were in effect as of December 31, 2015. \n (2) Refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. \n (3) We also have issued letters of credit totaling $2.2 million in connection with our investments. See \"Unfunded Commitments\" below, for a discussion of certain unfunded commitments related to our lending and net lease businesses. \n2015 Revolving Credit Facility-On March 27, 2015, we entered into our 2015 Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest at a floating rate indexed to one of several base rates plus a margin which adjusts upward or downward based upon our corporate credit rating. An undrawn credit facility commitment fee ranges from 0.375% to 0.50%, based on average utilization each quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the weighted average cost of the credit facility was 3.13%. Commitments under the revolving facility mature in March 2018. At maturity, we may convert outstanding borrowings to a one year term loan which matures in quarterly installments through March 2019.\n2012 Secured Credit Facilities-In March 2012, we entered into an $880.0 million senior secured credit agreement providing for two tranches of term loans: a $410.0 million 2012 A-1 tranche due March 2016, which bore interest at a rate of LIBOR + 4.00% (the \"2012 Tranche A-1 Facility\"), and a $470.0 million 2012 A-2 tranche due March 2017, which bears interest at a rate of LIBOR + 5.75% (the \"2012 Tranche A-2 Facility,\" together the \"2012 Secured Credit Facilities\"). The 2012 A-1 and A-2 tranches were issued at 98.0% of par and 98.5% of par, respectively, and both tranches include a LIBOR floor of 1.25%. Proceeds from the 2012 Secured Credit Facilities, together with cash on hand, were used to repurchase and repay other outstanding debt.\nThe 2012 Secured Credit Facilities are collateralized by a first lien on a fixed pool of assets. Proceeds from principal repayments and sales of collateral are applied to amortize the 2012 Secured Credit Facilities. Proceeds received for interest, rent, lease payments and fee income are retained by us. We may also make optional prepayments, subject to prepayment fees. The 2012 Tranche A-1 Facility was fully repaid in August 2013. Additionally, through December 31, 2015, we made cumulative amortization repayments of $130.3 million on the 2012 Tranche A-2 Facility. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, repayments of the 2012 Tranche A-2 Facility prior to maturity resulted in losses on early extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively, related to the accelerated amortization of discounts and unamortized deferred financing fees on the portion of the facility that was repaid. For the year ended December 31, 2013, repayments of the 2012 Tranche A-1 Facility prior to scheduled amortization dates resulted in losses on early extinguishment of debt of $4.4 million. These amounts are included in \"Loss on early extinguishment of debt, net\" in our consolidated statements of operations.\nUnsecured Notes-In June 2014, we issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured notes due November 2017 and $770.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior unsecured notes due July 2019. Net proceeds from these transactions, together with cash on hand, were used to fully repay and terminate the February 2013 Secured Credit Facility which had an outstanding balance of $1.32 billion.\nEncumbered/Unencumbered Assets-As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the carrying value of our encumbered and unencumbered assets by asset type are as follows ($ in thousands):\n\n___________________________________________________________\n (1) As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the amounts presented exclude general reserves for loan losses of $36.0 million and $33.5 million, respectively. \n (2) As of December 31, 2015, the amount presented excludes loan participations of $153.0 million. \nDebt Covenants\nOur outstanding unsecured debt securities contain corporate level covenants that include a covenant to maintain a ratio of unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness of at least 1.2x and a covenant not to incur additional indebtedness (except for incurrences of permitted debt), if on a pro forma basis, our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, determined in accordance with the indentures governing our debt securities, is 1.5x or lower. If any of our covenants are breached and not cured within applicable cure periods, the breach could result in acceleration of our debt securities unless a waiver or modification is agreed upon with the requisite percentage of the bondholders. While our ability to incur additional indebtedness under the fixed charge coverage ratio is currently limited, we are permitted to incur indebtedness for the purpose of refinancing existing indebtedness and for other permitted purposes under the indentures.\nThe 2012 Secured Credit Facilities and the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility contain certain covenants, including covenants relating to collateral coverage, dividend payments, restrictions on fundamental changes, transactions with affiliates, matters relating to the liens granted to the lenders and the delivery of information to the lenders. In particular, the 2012 Secured Credit Facilities require us to maintain collateral coverage of at least 1.25x outstanding borrowings on the facilities. The 2015 Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a borrowing base of assets and requires us to maintain both collateral coverage of at least 1.5x outstanding borrowings on the facility and a consolidated ratio of cash flow to fixed charges of at least 1.5x. The 2015 Revolving Credit Facility does not require that proceeds from the borrowing base be used to pay down outstanding borrowings provided the collateral coverage remains at least 1.5x outstanding borrowings on the facility. To satisfy this covenant, we have the option to pay down outstanding borrowings or substitute assets in the borrowing base. In addition, for so long as we maintain our qualification as a REIT, the 2012 Secured Credit Facilities and the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility permit us to distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis (prior to deducting certain cumulative NOL carryforwards in the case of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility). We may not pay common dividends if we cease to qualify as a REIT.\nThe 2012 Secured Credit Facilities and the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility contain cross default provisions that would allow the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate our indebtedness to them if we fail to pay amounts due in respect of our other recourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds or if the lenders under such other indebtedness are otherwise permitted to accelerate such indebtedness for any reason. The indentures governing our unsecured public debt securities permit the bondholders to declare an event of default and accelerate our indebtedness to them if our other recourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds is not paid at final maturity or if such indebtedness is accelerated.\nDerivatives-Our use of derivative financial instruments is primarily limited to the utilization of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps or other instruments to manage interest rate risk exposure and foreign exchange contracts to manage our risk to changes in foreign currencies. See Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data-Note 12\" for further details.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements-We are not dependent on the use of any off-balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity. We have made investments in various unconsolidated ventures. See Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data-Note 7\" for further details of our unconsolidated investments. Our maximum exposure to loss from these investments is limited to the carrying value of our investments and any unfunded commitments (see below).\nUnfunded Commitments-We generally fund construction and development loans and build-outs of space in net lease assets over a period of time if and when the borrowers and tenants meet established milestones and other performance criteria. We refer to these arrangements as Performance-Based Commitments. In addition, we sometimes establish a maximum amount of additional funding which we will make available to a borrower or tenant for an expansion or addition to a project if we approve of the expansion or addition in our sole discretion. We refer to these arrangements as Discretionary Fundings. Finally, we have committed to invest capital in several real estate funds and other ventures. These arrangements are referred to as Strategic Investments. As of December 31, 2015, the maximum amounts of the fundings we may make under each category, assuming all performance hurdles and milestones are met under the Performance-Based Commitments, that we approve all Discretionary Fundings and that 100% of our capital committed to Strategic Investments is drawn down, are as follows (in thousands):\n\nStock Repurchase Program-In September 2015, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the repurchase limit under our previously approved stock repurchase program to $50.0 million. In December 2015, after having substantially utilized the availability approved in September 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a new $50.0 million repurchase program. The program authorizes the repurchase of common stock from time to time in open market and privately negotiated purchases, including pursuant to one or more trading plans. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 5.7 million shares of our common stock for $70.4 million, at an average cost of $12.25 per share. There were no stock repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $48.7 million of common stock under our stock repurchase program. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we repurchased 5.2 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $52.0 million, at an average cost of $10.10 per share. In February 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new $50.0 million repurchase program.\nHPU Repurchase-In August 2015, we repurchased and retired all of our outstanding 14,888 HPUs, representing 2.8 million common stock equivalents. We repurchased these HPUs at fair value from current and former employees through an arms-length exchange offer. HPU holders could elect to receive $9.30 in cash or 0.7 shares of iStar common stock, or a combination thereof, per common stock equivalent underlying the HPUs. Approximately 37% of the outstanding HPUs were exchanged for $9.8 million in cash and approximately 63% of the outstanding HPUs were exchanged for 1.2 million shares of our common stock with a fair value of $15.2 million, representing the number of shares issued at the closing price of our common stock on August 13, 2015. The transaction value in excess of the HPUs carrying value of $9.8 million was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings (deficit) in our consolidated statements of changes in equity.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported as assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well controlled, reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. We base our estimates on historical corporate and industry experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and, therefore, routinely require adjustment.\nDuring 2015, management reviewed and evaluated these critical accounting estimates and believes they are appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are described in Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data-Note 3.\" The following is a summary of accounting policies that require more significant management estimates and judgments:\nReserve for loan losses-The reserve for loan losses reflects management's estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. If we determine that the collateral fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying value of a collateral-dependent loan, we will record a reserve. The reserve is increased (decreased) through \"Provision for (recovery of) loan losses\" in our consolidated statements of operations and is decreased by charge-offs. During delinquency and the foreclosure process, there are typically numerous points of negotiation with the borrower as we work toward a settlement or other alternative resolution, which can impact the potential for loan repayment or receipt of collateral. Our policy is to charge off a loan when we determine, based on a variety of factors, that all commercially reasonable means of recovering the loan balance have been exhausted. This may occur at different times, including when we receive cash or other assets in a pre-foreclosure sale or take control of the underlying collateral in full satisfaction of the loan upon foreclosure or deed-in-lieu, or when we have otherwise ceased significant\ncollection efforts. We consider circumstances such as the foregoing to be indicators that the final steps in the loan collection process have occurred and that a loan is uncollectible. At this point, a loss is confirmed and the loan and related reserve will be charged off. We have one portfolio segment, represented by commercial real estate lending, whereby we utilize a uniform process for determining our reserves for loan losses. The reserve for loan losses includes a general, formula-based component and an asset-specific component.\nThe general reserve component covers performing loans and reserves for loan losses are recorded when (i) available information as of each balance sheet date indicates that it is probable a loss has occurred in the portfolio and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The formula-based general reserve is derived from estimated principal default probabilities and loss severities applied to groups of loans based upon risk ratings assigned to loans with similar risk characteristics during our quarterly loan portfolio assessment. During this assessment, we perform a comprehensive analysis of our loan portfolio and assign risk ratings to loans that incorporate management's current judgments about their credit quality based on all known and relevant internal and external factors that may affect collectability. We consider, among other things, payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. This methodology results in loans being segmented by risk classification into risk rating categories that are associated with estimated probabilities of default and principal loss. Ratings range from \"1\" to \"5\" with \"1\" representing the lowest risk of loss and \"5\" representing the highest risk of loss. We estimate loss rates based on historical realized losses experienced within our portfolio and take into account current economic conditions affecting the commercial real estate market when establishing appropriate time frames to evaluate loss experience.\nThe asset-specific reserve component relates to reserves for losses on impaired loans. We consider a loan to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, we believe that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. This assessment is made on a loan-by-loan basis each quarter based on such factors as payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. A reserve is established for an impaired loan when the present value of payments expected to be received, observable market prices, or the estimated fair value of the collateral (for loans that are dependent on the collateral for repayment) is lower than the carrying value of that loan.\nSubstantially all of our impaired loans are collateral dependent and impairment is measured using the estimated fair value of collateral, less costs to sell. We generally use the income approach through internally developed valuation models to estimate the fair value of the collateral for such loans. In more limited cases, we obtain external \"as is\" appraisals for loan collateral, generally when third party participations exist. Valuations are performed or obtained at the time a loan is determined to be impaired and designated non-performing, and they are updated if circumstances indicate that a significant change in value has occurred. In limited cases, appraised values may be discounted when real estate markets rapidly deteriorate.\nA loan is also considered impaired if its terms are modified in a troubled debt restructuring (\"TDR\"). A TDR occurs when we grant a concession to a debtor that is experiencing financial difficulties. Impairments on TDR loans are generally measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the original loan.\nThe provision for (recovery of) loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $36.6 million, $(1.7) million and $5.5 million, respectively. The total reserve for loan losses as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, included asset specific reserves of $72.2 million and $65.0 million, respectively, and general reserves of $36.0 million and $33.5 million, respectively.\nAcquisition of real estate-We generally acquire real estate assets or land and development assets through purchases or through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in full or partial satisfaction of non-performing loans. When we acquire assets these properties are classified as \"Real estate, net\" or \"Land and development\" on our consolidated balance sheets. When we intend to hold, operate or develop the property for a period of at least 12 months, assets are classified as \"Real estate, net,\" and when we intend to market these properties for sale in the near term, assets are classified as \"Real estate available and held for sale.\" When we purchase assets the properties are recorded at cost. Foreclosed assets classified as real estate and land and development are initially recorded at their estimated fair value and assets classified as assets held for sale are recorded at their estimated fair value less costs to sell. The excess of the carrying value of the loan over these amounts is charged-off against the reserve for loan losses. In both cases, upon acquisition, tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their estimated fair values.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we received title to properties in satisfaction of mortgage loans with fair values of $13.4 million, $77.9 million and $31.1 million, respectively, for which those properties had served as collateral.\nImpairment or disposal of long-lived assets-Real estate assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell and are included in \"Real estate available and held for sale\" on our consolidated balance sheets. The difference between the estimated fair value less costs to sell and the carrying value will be recorded as an impairment charge. Impairment for real estate assets disposed of or classified as held for sale on or before December 31, 2013 are\nincluded in \"Income (loss) from discontinued operations\" in our consolidated statements of operations. Impairment for real estate assets disposed of or classified as held for sale after December 31, 2013 are included in \"Impairment of assets\" in our consolidated statements of operations. Once the asset is classified as held for sale, depreciation expense is no longer recorded and historical operating results are reclassified to \"Income (loss) from discontinued operations\" in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe periodically review real estate to be held and used and land and development assets for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The asset's value is impaired only if management's estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the asset (taking into account the anticipated holding period of the asset) is less than the carrying value. Such estimate of cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the asset and reflected as an adjustment to the basis of the asset. Impairments of real estate and land and development assets are recorded in \"Impairment of assets\" in our consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded impairments on real estate and land and development assets totaling $10.5 million resulting from a change in business strategy and unfavorable local market conditions for certain assets. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded impairments on real estate and land and development assets totaling $34.6 million and $14.4 million, respectively, resulting from unfavorable local market conditions and changes in business strategy for certain assets. Of these amounts, $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 has been recorded in \"Income (loss) from discontinued operations\" in our consolidated statements of operations due to the assets being disposed of or classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2013.\nIdentified intangible assets and liabilities-We record intangible assets and liabilities acquired at their estimated fair values, and determine whether such intangible assets and liabilities have finite or indefinite lives. As of December 31, 2015, all such acquired intangible assets and liabilities have finite lives. We amortize finite lived intangible assets and liabilities over the period which the assets and liabilities are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired. We review finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If we determine the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable we will record an impairment charge to the extent its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Impairments of intangibles are recorded in \"Impairment of assets\" in our consolidated statements of operations.\nValuation of deferred tax assets-Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. When evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider, among other matters, estimates of expected future taxable income, nature of current and cumulative losses, existing and projected book/tax differences, tax planning strategies available, and the general and industry specific economic outlook. This realizability analysis is inherently subjective, as it requires us to forecast our business and general economic environment in future periods. Changes in estimate of deferred tax asset realizability, if any are included in \"Income tax (expense) benefit\" in the consolidated statements of operations.\nWhile certain entities with NOLs may generate profits in the future, which may allow us to utilize the NOLs, we continue to record a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset due to the history of losses and the uncertainty of the entities' ability to generate such profits. We recorded a full valuation allowance of $53.9 million and $54.3 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nVariable interest entities-We evaluate our investments and other contractual arrangements to determine if our interests constitute variable interests in a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") and if we are the primary beneficiary. There is a significant amount of judgment required to determine if an entity is considered a VIE and if we are the primary beneficiary. We first perform a qualitative analysis, which requires certain subjective decisions regarding our assessment, including, but not limited to, which interests create or absorb variability, the contractual terms, the key decision making powers, impact on the VIE's economic performance and related party relationships. An iterative quantitative analysis is required if our qualitative analysis proves inconclusive as to whether the entity is a VIE or we are the primary beneficiary and consolidation is required.\nFair value of assets and liabilities-The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities\ncould result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement.\nSee Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data-Note 16\" for a complete discussion on how we determine fair value of financial and non-financial assets and financial liabilities and the related measurement techniques and estimates involved.", "item_7_tables": "Table 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

in 2014, primarily due to higher land development revenue and interest income.\n\n- Net loss was $6.2 million in 2015 compared to net income of $15.8 million in 2014. The decrease was mainly due to lower earnings from equity method investments. \n\n- As of December 31, 2015, the company had $711.1 million of unrestricted cash that it expects to use primarily to fund future investments, pay down debt, and for general corporate purposes. \n\n- The company has debt maturities of $926.4 million due before December 31, 2016. Over the next 12 months, it expects to fund $225-300 million of capital expenditures on its portfolio. \n\n- The reserve for loan losses was $108.2 million or 6.6% of total loans as of December 31, 2015, compared to $98.5 million or 7.6% as of December 31, 2014.\n\n- Critical accounting estimates outlined include reserve for loan losses, acquisition of real estate, impairment of long-lived assets, and valuation of deferred tax assets.\n\nIn summary, while revenue increased in 2015, higher land development costs and lower earnings from equity method investments led to a net loss for the year. The company has significant debt maturities and capital commitments over the next 12 months, but also has substantial liquidity to manage its obligations. Loan quality is showing signs of stabilization."}
