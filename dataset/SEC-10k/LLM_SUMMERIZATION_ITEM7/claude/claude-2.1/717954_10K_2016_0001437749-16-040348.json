MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBusiness Overview\nUniFirst Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, hereunder referred to as we\u201d, our\u201d, the Company\u201d, or UniFirst\u201d, is one of the largest providers of workplace uniforms and protective work wear clothing in the United States. We design, manufacture, personalize, rent, clean, deliver, and sell a wide range of uniforms and protective clothing, including shirts, pants, jackets, coveralls, lab coats, smocks, aprons and specialized protective wear, such as flame resistant and high visibility garments. We also rent and sell industrial wiping products, floor mats, facility service products and other non-garment items, and provide restroom and cleaning supplies and first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies, to a variety of manufacturers, retailers and service companies.\nWe serve businesses of all sizes in numerous industry categories. Typical customers include automobile service centers and dealers, delivery services, food and general merchandise retailers, food processors and service operations, light manufacturers, maintenance facilities, restaurants, service companies, soft and durable goods wholesalers, transportation companies, and others who require employee clothing for image, identification, protection or utility purposes. We also provide our customers with restroom and cleaning supplies, including air fresheners, paper products and hand soaps.\nAt certain specialized facilities, we also decontaminate and clean work clothes and other items that may have been exposed to radioactive materials and service special cleanroom protective wear and facilities. Typical customers for these specialized services include government agencies, research and development laboratories, high technology companies and utilities operating nuclear reactors.\nWe continue to expand into additional geographic markets through acquisitions and organic growth. We currently service over 300,000 customer locations in the United States, Canada and Europe from over 240 customer service, distribution and manufacturing facilities.\nUS GAAP establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information of those segments to be presented in interim financial reports issued to shareholders. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. Our chief operating decision-maker is our chief executive officer. We have six operating segments based on the information reviewed by our chief executive officer: US Rental and Cleaning, Canadian Rental and Cleaning, Manufacturing ( MFG\u201d), Specialty Garments Rental and Cleaning ( Specialty Garments\u201d), First Aid and Corporate. The US Rental and Cleaning and Canadian Rental and Cleaning operating segments have been combined to form the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. Refer to Note 15, Segment Reporting\u201d, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for our disclosure of segment information.\nThe US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment purchases, rents, cleans, delivers and sells, uniforms and protective clothing and non-garment items in the United States and Canada. The operations of the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment are referred to by us as our \u2018industrial laundry operations' and we refer to the locations related to this reporting segment as our \u2018industrial laundries'.\nThe MFG operating segment designs and manufactures uniforms and non-garment items primarily for the purpose of providing these goods to the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. The amounts reflected as revenues of MFG are primarily generated when goods are shipped from our manufacturing facilities, or subcontract manufacturers, to our other locations. These intercompany revenues are recorded at a transfer price which is typically in excess of the actual manufacturing cost. Products are carried in inventory and subsequently placed in service and amortized at this transfer price. On a consolidated basis, intercompany MFG revenues and MFG income are eliminated and the carrying value of inventories and rental merchandise in service is reduced to the manufacturing cost. Income before income taxes from MFG, net of the intercompany MFG elimination, offsets the merchandise amortization costs incurred by the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment as the merchandise costs of this reporting segment are amortized and recognized based on inventories purchased from MFG at the transfer price which is above our manufacturing cost.\nThe Corporate operating segment consists of costs associated with our distribution center, sales and marketing, information systems, engineering, materials management, manufacturing planning, finance, budgeting, human resources, other general and administrative costs and interest expense. The revenues generated from the Corporate operating segment represent certain direct sales made directly from our distribution center. The products sold by this operating segment are the same products rented and sold by the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. In the segment disclosures in Note 15, Segment Reporting\u201d, of our Consolidated Financial Statements, no assets or capital expenditures are presented for the Corporate operating segment as no assets are allocated to this operating segment in the information reviewed by our chief executive officer. However, depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets are reflected in income from operations and income before income taxes for the Corporate operating segment. The assets that give rise to this depreciation and amortization are included in the total assets of the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment as this is how they are tracked and reviewed by us.\nWe refer to our US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning, MFG, and Corporate segments combined as our Core Laundry Operations\u201d.\nThe Specialty Garments operating segment purchases, rents, cleans, delivers and sells, specialty garments and non-garment items primarily for nuclear and cleanroom applications and provides cleanroom cleaning services at limited customer locations. The First Aid operating segment sells first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies as well as maintains wholesale distribution and pill packaging operations.\nApproximately 91% of our revenues in fiscal 2016 were derived from US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning, and Corporate. A key driver of this business is the number of workers employed by our customers. Our revenues are directly impacted by fluctuations in these employment levels. Revenues from Specialty Garments, which accounted for approximately 6% of our 2016 revenues, increase during outages and refueling by nuclear power plants, as garment usage increases at these times. First Aid represented approximately 3% of our total revenue in fiscal 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with US GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on historical information, current trends, and information available from other sources. The actual results could differ from our estimates.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of our foreign operations is the local country's currency. Transaction gains and losses, including gains and losses on our intercompany transactions, are included in other (income) expense, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during each month of the fiscal year. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRevenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe recognize revenue from rental operations in the period in which the services are provided. Direct sale revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are performed or when the product is shipped. Our judgment and estimates are used in determining the collectability of accounts receivable and evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We consider specific accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and the age of outstanding balances as part of our evaluation. Changes in our estimates are reflected in the period they become known. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Material changes in our estimates may result in significant differences in the amount and timing of bad debt expense recognition for any given period. Our revenues do not include taxes we collect from our customers and remit to governmental authorities.\nInventories and Rental Merchandise in Service\nOur inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value, net of any reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. Judgments and estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to our customers or used in our rental operations. Historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both excess and obsolete inventories. If actual product demand and market conditions are less favorable than the amount we projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required. We use the first-in, first-out ( FIFO\u201d) method to value our inventories, which primarily consist of finished goods.\nRental merchandise in service is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives of the merchandise, which range from 6 to 36 months. In establishing estimated lives for merchandise in service, our management considers historical experience and the intended use of the merchandise. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of operating profit for any period if we make significant changes to our estimates.\nGoodwill, Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIn accordance with US GAAP, we do not amortize goodwill. Instead, current accounting guidance requires that companies test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis. In addition, US GAAP requires that companies test goodwill if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned below its carrying amount. Our evaluation considers changes in the operating environment, competitive information, market trends, operating performance and cash flow modeling.\nWe complete our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and there have been no impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.\nWe cannot predict future economic conditions and their impact on the Company or the future market value of our stock. A decline in our market capitalization and/or deterioration in general economic conditions could negatively and materially impact our assumptions and assessment of the fair value of our business. If general economic conditions or our financial performance deteriorate, we may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge in the future which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nProperty, plant and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on our estimates of the period that the assets will generate economic benefits. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired. There were no material impairments of property, plant and equipment, or definite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.\nInsurance\nWe self-insure for certain obligations related to health, workers' compensation, vehicles and general liability programs. We also purchase stop-loss insurance policies in certain instances to protect ourselves from catastrophic losses. Judgments and estimates are used in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for events that have occurred, but have not been reported. Our estimates consider historical claim experience and other factors. Our liabilities are based on our estimates, and, while we believe that our accruals are adequate, the ultimate liability may be significantly different from the amounts recorded. In certain cases where partial insurance coverage exists, we must estimate the portion of the liability that will be covered by existing insurance policies to arrive at our net expected liability. Receivables for insurance recoveries are recorded as assets, on an undiscounted basis. Changes in our claim experience, our ability to settle claims or other estimates and judgments we use could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any given period.\nEnvironmental and Other Contingencies\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of our business operations, including environmental matters, personal injury, customer contract matters and employment claims. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. We regularly consult with our attorneys and outside consultants, in our consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, before recording a contingent liability. We record accruals for environmental and other contingencies based on enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, our estimates of costs, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, and the input of our attorneys and outside consultants.\nThe estimated liability for environmental contingencies has been discounted as of August 27, 2016 using risk-free interest rates ranging from 1.6% to 2.3% over periods ranging from ten to thirty years. The estimated current costs, net of legal settlements with insurance carriers, have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at 3% per year. Changes in enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, our estimates of costs, risk-free interest rates, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, the input of our attorneys and outside consultants or other factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for our environmental and other contingent liabilities. Refer to Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion and analysis.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nUnder US GAAP, asset retirement obligations generally apply to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or the normal operation of a long-lived asset. Current accounting guidance requires that we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset.\nWe have recognized as a liability the present value of the estimated future costs to decommission our nuclear laundry facilities in accordance with US GAAP. We depreciate, on a straight-line basis, the amount added to property, plant and equipment and recognize accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the various remaining lives which range from approximately one to twenty-eight years.\nOur estimated liability has been based on historical experience in decommissioning nuclear laundry facilities, estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, external vendor estimates as to the cost to decommission these assets in the future, and federal and state regulatory requirements. The estimated current costs have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at 3% per year. The liability has been discounted using credit-adjusted risk-free rates that range from approximately 7.0% to 7.5%. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, estimated dates of decommissioning, changes in decommissioning costs, changes in federal or state regulatory guidance on the decommissioning of such facilities, or other changes in estimates. Changes due to revisions in our estimates will be recognized by adjusting the carrying amount of the liability and the related long-lived asset if the assets are still in service, or charged to expense in the period if the assets are no longer in service.\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan and other Pension Plans\nWe recognize pension expense on an accrual basis over our employees' estimated service periods. Pension expense is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements.\nThe calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires us to use a number of critical assumptions, including the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, the assumed discount rate, the assumed rate of compensation increases and life expectancy of participants. Changes in our assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual expense can differ from these assumptions. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.\nIncome Taxes\nWe compute income tax expense by jurisdiction based on our operations in each jurisdiction. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the amounts recognized for income tax and financial reporting purposes at currently enacted tax rates.\nWe are periodically reviewed by U.S. domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews typically include inquiries regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating our exposure associated with various filing positions, we have recorded estimated reserves. Refer to Note 4, Income Taxes\u201d, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our accounting for income taxes and uncertain tax positions for financial accounting purposes.\nWe have undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries of approximately $124.8 million as of August 27, 2016. We consider these undistributed earnings as indefinitely reinvested and therefore have not provided for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes. In addition, we have accumulated $54.9 million in cash outside the United States that is expected to be invested indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were distributed to the U.S. in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of our international subsidiaries were sold or transferred, we would likely be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, net of the impact of any available foreign tax credits as well as foreign withholding taxes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. taxes on these undistributed earnings.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents certain selected financial data,

We also rent industrial wiping products, floor mats, facility service products, other non-garment items, and provide restroom and cleaning supplies and first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies, to a variety of manufacturers, retailers and service companies. We have five reporting segments, US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning, MFG, Specialty Garments, First Aid and Corporate. We refer to the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning, MFG, and Corporate reporting segments combined as our Core Laundry Operations.\u201d\nCost of revenues include the amortization of rental merchandise in service and merchandise costs related to direct sales as well as labor and other production, service and delivery costs, and distribution costs associated with operating our Core Laundry Operations, Specialty Garments facilities, and First Aid locations. Selling and administrative costs include costs related to our sales and marketing functions as well as general and administrative costs associated with our corporate offices, non-operating environmental sites and operating locations including information systems, engineering, materials management, manufacturing planning, finance, budgeting, and human resources.\nWe have a substantial number of plants and conduct a significant portion of our business in energy producing regions in the U.S and Canada. The dramatic decrease in oil prices beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present has directly affected our customers in the oil industry as they have curtailed their level of operations. In addition, this decline has also had a corresponding effect on our customers in businesses which service or supply the oil industry as well as our customers in unrelated businesses located in areas which had benefited from the economic expansion generated by the robust growth driven by the higher oil prices in prior years. As a result, our organic growth has been impacted by elevated headcount reductions in our wearer base as well as increased lost accounts. We expect the headcount reductions that we continue to experience at a higher than normal rate will also have an impact on our organic growth into fiscal 2017. On the other hand, we have benefited from lower costs of the gasoline used to fuel our vehicles and the natural gas used to operate our plants. While it is difficult to quantify the positive and negative impacts on our future financial results from lower oil prices, the negative impact on our results from the cutbacks by our customers in the oil industry and other affected businesses have and will continue to outweigh the benefits from lower energy costs.\nThe cost of healthcare that we provide to our employees has grown over the last few years at a rate in excess of our revenue growth and as a result, has negatively impacted our operating results. In fiscal 2015, the Affordable Care Act ( ACA\u201d) required us to modify one of the healthcare plans we provided to our employees. Moreover, it is generally expected that healthcare costs in the United States will increase over the coming years at rates in excess of inflation. As a result of these factors, and depending on the effect of the modifications we have made, and may make in the future, to our employee healthcare plans and enrollment levels in those plans, we expect that our future operating results will continue to be further adversely impacted by increasing healthcare costs.\nWe are currently undertaking a company-wide initiative to update our customer relationship management ( CRM\u201d) systems. As of August 27, 2016, we have capitalized $47.9 million related to our CRM project ( Unity 20/20\u201d). Although we did not deploy this system in fiscal 2016, we continued to make investments in IT infrastructure, including headcount, to help support this and other technology initiatives that impacted our results of operations. In addition, our future operating results will be impacted by the eventual depreciation of our Unity 20/20 investment.\nOur business is subject to various state and federal regulations, including employment laws and regulations, minimum wage requirements, overtime requirements, working condition requirements, citizenship requirements, healthcare insurance mandates and other laws and regulations. We expect that our labor costs will rise in fiscal 2017 as a result of increases in state and local minimum wage levels as well as the recent update to the regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act which has expanded the number of employees entitled to overtime pay. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the updated standard on our labor costs but anticipates that our future operating results will be adversely impacted.\nA portion of our sales is derived from international markets, including Canada. Revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar represented approximately 7.9%, 8.4% and 9.8% of total consolidated revenues for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The operating results of our international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars and such results are affected by movements in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, a weaker Canadian dollar increases the costs to our Canadian operations of merchandise and other operational inputs that are sourced from outside Canada, which has the effect of reducing the operating margins of our Canadian business if we are unable to recover these additional costs through price adjustments with our Canadian customers. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted our consolidated revenues by 0.8%, 1.1% and 0.5%, respectively. These impacts were primarily driven by unfavorable fluctuations in the Canadian dollar. Our operating results in future years could be negatively impacted by any further devaluation, as compared to the U.S. dollar, of the Canadian dollar or any of the currencies of the other countries in which we operate.\nFiscal Year Ended August 27, 2016 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended August 29, 2015\nRevenues\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> August 27,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> August 29,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Laundry Operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,329,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,322,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Garments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Aid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total consolidated revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,468,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,456,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn fiscal 2016, our consolidated revenues increased by $11.4 million from the comparable period in 2015, or 0.8%. The increase in our consolidated revenues was primarily driven by the growth in our Core Laundry Operations, with revenues increasing to $1.329 billion in fiscal 2016 from $1.322 billion in fiscal 2015, or 0.5%. Excluding the negative effect of a weaker Canadian dollar of 0.7%, as well as the positive effect of acquisitions of 0.5%, organic growth was 0.7%. Organic growth consists primarily of new sales, price increases, and net changes in the wearer levels at our existing customers, offset by lost accounts. Our organic growth during fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by reductions in wearer levels at our customers that directly or indirectly support oil or other energy production in the United States and Canada.\nSpecialty Garments' revenue increased from $87.5 million in fiscal 2015 to $91.3 million in fiscal 2016, or 4.3%. This increase was primarily the result of strong growth from this segment's cleanroom and European operations. First Aid revenues increased 1.4%, from $46.8 million in fiscal 2015 to $47.4 million in fiscal 2016.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues increased as a percentage of revenues from 60.7%, or $884.7 million, in fiscal 2015 to 61.3% of revenues, or $900.4 million, in fiscal 2016. This increase was driven by higher costs as a percent of revenues in our Core Laundry Operations, including merchandise amortization, payroll and healthcare costs and other production costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower fuel costs associated with our fleet of delivery vehicles and lower natural gas costs used to operate our plants compared to the prior year period. In addition, our Specialty Garments segment partially offset this impact with lower overall costs of revenues as a percent of revenues.\nSelling and administrative expense\nOur selling and administrative expenses decreased to 19.4% of revenues, or $284.8 million in fiscal 2016, from 20.2% of revenues, or $294.4 million in fiscal 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the settlement of environmental litigation which resulted in a $15.9 million gain that was recorded as a reduction to selling and administrative expenses. The comparison of selling and administrative expenses also benefited from lower legal costs. These positive comparisons were offset in part by payroll and other administrative costs which were higher as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization\nOur depreciation and amortization expense was $81.6 million, or 5.6% of revenues, in fiscal 2016 compared to $77.1 million, or 5.3% of revenues, in fiscal 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense increased due to capital expenditure and acquisition activity in earlier periods.\nIncome from operations\nFor the year ended August 27, 2016, the changes in revenues in our Core Laundry Operations, Specialty Garments and First Aid segments, as well as the changes in our costs discussed above, resulted in the following changes in our income from operations:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> August 27,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> August 29,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Laundry Operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>186,074 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>187,586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,512 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Garments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Aid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(561 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-10.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total consolidated income from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>201,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther (income) expense\nOther (income) expense, which includes interest expense, interest income and foreign exchange loss, was income of $2.2 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to income of $0.9 million for fiscal 2015. The increase of $1.3 million was primarily due to foreign currency losses of $0.3 million in fiscal 2016 compared to foreign currency losses of $1.6 million during fiscal 2015.\nProvision for income taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 38.5% for fiscal 2016 compared to 38.2% for fiscal 2015. The increase in our effective tax rate was due to a change in the mix of our jurisdictional earnings.\nFiscal Year Ended August 29, 2015 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended August 30, 2014\nRevenues\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> August 29,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> August 30,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Laundry Operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,322,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,259,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Garments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,971 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-4.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Aid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,928 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total consolidated revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,456,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,394,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn fiscal 2015, our consolidated revenues increased by $61.7 million from the comparable period in 2014, or 4.4%. The increase in our consolidated revenues was primarily driven by the growth in our Core Laundry Operations, with revenues increasing to $1.322 billion in fiscal 2015 from $1.259 billion in fiscal 2014, or 5.0%. Excluding the negative effect of a weaker Canadian dollar of 0.9%, as well as the positive effect of acquisitions of 0.7%, organic growth was 5.2%. Organic growth consists primarily of new sales, price increases, and net changes in the wearer levels at our existing customers, offset by lost accounts. Organic growth in fiscal 2015 benefited from new account sales and annual price adjustments. These benefits were partially offset by decreases in net wearer counts at our existing customers primarily due to reductions at customers that directly or indirectly support oil or other energy production, as well as higher lost accounts compared to a year ago.\nSpecialty Garments' revenue decreased from $91.5 million in fiscal 2014 to $87.5 million in fiscal 2015, or 4.3%. This decrease was the result of reduced power reactor business in North American compared to a year ago as well as the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar and euro. This segment's results are often affected by the timing and length of its customers' power reactor outages as well as its project-based activities. First Aid revenues increased 6.5%, from $43.9 million in fiscal 2014 to $46.8 million in fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily due to solid performance by this segment's wholesale distribution and pill packaging operations.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues decreased as a percentage of revenues from 61.5%, or $858.3 million, in fiscal 2014 to 60.7% of revenues, or $884.7 million, in fiscal 2015. This decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to lower fuel costs associated with our fleet of delivery vehicles, lower natural gas costs and lower payroll related costs in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year. These costs were offset by higher merchandise amortization costs as a percentage of revenues during fiscal 2015 as compared to the prior year.\nSelling and administrative expense\nOur selling and administrative expenses increased to 20.2% of revenues, or $294.4 million in fiscal 2015, from 19.5% of revenues, or $271.6 million in fiscal 2014. This increase was primarily due to higher legal expenses and reserves related to miscellaneous legal matters, as well as higher cost related to IT infrastructure investments. In fiscal 2015, we also recorded an additional $3.0 million in expense related to our environmental contingency reserves compared to the prior year. This increase was due to a number of factors, including additional costs we expect to incur associated with the construction of a planned municipal transit station in the area of our Somerville site as well as the impact of lower interest rates on the discounting of our environmental liabilities in the prior year.\nDepreciation and amortization\nOur depreciation and amortization expense was $77.1 million, or 5.3% of revenues, in fiscal 2015 compared to $71.8 million, or 5.1% of revenues, in fiscal 2014. Depreciation and amortization expense increased due to capital expenditure and acquisition activity in earlier periods.\nIncome from operations\nFor the year ended August 29, 2015, the changes in revenues in our Core Laundry Operations, Specialty Garments and First Aid segments, as well as the changes in our costs discussed above, resulted in the following changes in our income from operations:\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> August 29,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> August 30,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Laundry Operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>187,586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>182,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Garments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Aid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total consolidated income from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>193,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther (income) expense\nOther (income) expense, which includes interest expense, interest income and foreign exchange loss, was income of $0.9 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to income of $2.1 million for fiscal 2014. The decrease of $1.2 million in other income was primarily the result of foreign currency losses of approximately $1.6 million during fiscal 2015 compared to foreign currency losses of approximately $0.3 million during fiscal 2014.\nProvision for income taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 38.2% for fiscal 2015 compared to 38.6% for fiscal 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in state income taxes as well as a change in the mix of jurisdictional earnings in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $363.8 million as of August 27, 2016, an increase of $87.2 million from $276.6 million as of August 29, 2015. Our working capital was $625.0 million as of August 27, 2016 compared to $477.7 million as of August 29, 2015. Subsequent to August 27, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Arrow Uniform for a cash purchase price of approximately $122.0 million. We generated $207.6 million and $226.9 million in cash from operating activities in the fiscal years ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, respectively. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balances, our cash generated from future operations and amounts available under our Credit Agreement (defined below) will be sufficient to meet our current anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nWe have accumulated $54.9 million in cash outside the United States that is expected to be invested indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were distributed to the U.S. in the form of dividends, we would likely be subject to additional U.S. income taxes. However, we do not believe that any resulting taxes payable would have a material impact on our liquidity.\nCash flows provided by operating activities have historically been the primary source of our liquidity. We generally use these cash flows to fund most, if not all, of our operations, capital expenditure and acquisition activities as well as dividends on our common stock. We may also use cash flows provided by operating activities, as well as proceeds from loans payable and long-term debt, to fund growth and acquisition opportunities, as well as other cash requirements.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended August 27, 2016 was $207.6 million, a decrease of $19.3 million from the prior fiscal year when cash provided by operating activities was $226.9 million. This net decrease was partially driven by the timing of income tax payments and the impact of changes in deferred income taxes. In addition, the comparison of cash provided by operating activities was impacted by a settlement related to environmental litigation the Company entered into in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 which resulted in a gain of $15.9 million booked as a reduction of selling and administrative expenses. A significant portion of the funds related to this settlement were received in September 2016 and, therefore, did not translate into operating cash flow during fiscal 2016.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended August 27, 2016 was $114.7 million, a decrease of 9.6 million from the prior fiscal year when cash used in investing activities was $124.3 million. The net decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by a decrease in cash outflows of $5.8 million for the acquisition of businesses as well as a decrease in cash outflow of $2.9 million for capital expenditures.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended August 27, 2016 was $5.6 million compared to cash used in financing activities of $6.3 million for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2015. This change was primarily due to a net decrease of cash outflows of $4.9 million related to proceeds and payments on loans payable and long-term debt in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. This decrease was offset in part by a decrease in proceeds received from the exercise of share based awards.\nLong-term debt and borrowing capacity\nOn April 11, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of banks, which matures on April 11, 2021. The Credit Agreement amended and restated our prior $250.0 million revolving credit agreement, which was scheduled to mature on May 4, 2016. Under the Credit Agreement, we are able to borrow funds at variable interest rates based on, at our election, the Eurodollar rate or a base rate, plus in each case a spread based on our consolidated funded debt ratio. Availability of credit requires compliance with certain financial and other covenants, including a maximum consolidated funded debt ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement. We test our compliance with these financial covenants on a fiscal quarterly basis. As of August 27, 2016, the interest rates applicable to our borrowings under the Credit Agreement would be calculated as LIBOR plus 75 basis points at the time of the respective borrowing. As of August 27, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings and had outstanding letters of credit amounting to $53.0 million, leaving $197.0 million available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement.\nAs of August 27, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nIn January 2015, we entered into sixteen forward contracts to exchange Canadian dollars ( CAD\u201d) for U.S. dollars at fixed exchange rates in order to manage our exposure related to certain forecasted CAD denominated sales of one of our subsidiaries. The hedged transactions are specified as the first amount of CAD denominated revenues invoiced by one of our domestic subsidiaries each fiscal quarter, beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 and continuing through the second fiscal quarter of 2019. In total, we will sell approximately 31.0 million CAD at an average Canadian-dollar exchange rate of 0.7825 over these quarterly periods. We concluded that the forward contracts met the criteria to qualify as a cash flow hedge under US GAAP. Accordingly, we have reflected all changes in the fair value of the forward contracts in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, a component of shareholders' equity. Upon the maturity of each foreign exchange forward contract, the gain or loss on the contract will be recorded as an adjustment to revenues.\nAs of August 27, 2016, we had forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 17.1 million CAD outstanding and recorded the fair value of the contracts of $0.1 million in other long-term assets and $0.1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets with a corresponding gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income of $0.1 million, which was recorded net of tax. During the fiscal year ended August 27, 2016, we reclassified $0.2 million from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to revenue, related to the derivative financial instruments. The gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as of August 27, 2016 is expected to be reclassified to revenues prior to its maturity on February 22, 2019.\nEnvironmental and Legal Contingencies\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other substances. In particular, industrial laundries currently use and must dispose of detergent waste water and other residues, and, in the past, used perchloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents. We are attentive to the environmental concerns surrounding the disposal of these materials and have, through the years, taken measures to avoid their improper disposal. Over the years, we have settled, or contributed to the settlement of, actions or claims brought against us relating to the disposal of hazardous materials and there can be no assurance that we will not have to expend material amounts to remediate the consequences of any such disposal in the future.\nUS GAAP requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. We regularly consult with attorneys and outside consultants in our consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances before recording a contingent liability. Changes in enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, our estimates of costs, risk-free interest rates, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, the input of our attorneys and outside consultants or other factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for our environmental and other contingent liabilities.\nUnder environmental laws, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on, or in, or emanating from such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. There can be no assurances that acquired or leased locations have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon our Company under such laws or expose our Company to third party actions such as tort suits. We continue to address environmental conditions under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise with respect to sites located in or related to Woburn, Massachusetts, Somerville, Massachusetts, Springfield, Massachusetts, Uvalde, Texas, Stockton, California, three sites related to former operations in Williamstown, Vermont, as well as sites located in Goldsboro, North Carolina, Wilmington, North Carolina, Landover, Maryland and Syracuse, New York.\nWe have accrued certain costs related to the sites described above as it has been determined that the costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We have potential exposure related to a parcel of land (the Central Area\u201d) related to the Woburn, Massachusetts site mentioned above. Currently, the consent decree for the Woburn site does not define or require any remediation work in the Central Area. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA\u201d) has provided us and other signatories to the consent decree with comments on the design and implementation of groundwater and soil remedies at the Woburn site and investigation of environmental conditions in the Central Area. We, and other signatories, have implemented and proposed to do additional work at the Woburn site but many of the EPA's comments remain to be resolved. We have accrued costs to perform certain work responsive to EPA's comments. We have implemented mitigation measures and continue to monitor environmental conditions at the Somerville, Massachusetts site. In addition, we have received demands from the local transit authority for reimbursement of certain costs associated with its construction of a new municipal transit station in the area of our Somerville site. This station is part of a planned extension of the transit system. Due to cost projections of the extension which now substantially exceed original estimates, the local transit authority has placed the extension on hold pending its redesign and receipt of related state and federal approvals and funding increases. We have reserved for costs in connection with this matter; however, in light of the uncertainties associated with this matter, these costs and the related reserve may change. We have also received notice that the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection is conducting an audit of our investigation and remediation work with respect to the Somerville site.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company entered into a settlement related to environmental litigation which resulted in a $15.9 million gain that was recorded as a reduction of selling and administrative expenses. This gain consisted of amounts previously received but not recognized into income as well as amounts that the Company received in September 2016.\nWe routinely review and evaluate sites that may require remediation and monitoring and determine our estimated costs based on various estimates and assumptions. These estimates are developed using our internal sources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on:\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Management's judgment and experience in remediating and monitoring our sites;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation and monitoring;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) who may be liable for remediation and monitoring of a specific site; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The typical allocation of costs among PRPs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere is usually a range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with each site. In accordance with US GAAP, our accruals represent the amount within the range that we believe is the best estimate or the low end of a range of estimates if no point within the range is a better estimate. When we believe that both the amount of a particular liability and the timing of the payments are reliably determinable, we adjust the cost in current dollars using a rate of 3% for inflation until the time of expected payment and discount the cost to present value using current risk-free interest rates. As of August 27, 2016, the risk-free interest rates we utilized ranged from 1.6% to 2.3%.\nFor environmental liabilities that have been discounted, we include interest accretion, based on the effective interest method, in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The changes to the amounts of our environmental liabilities for the years ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> August 27,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> August 29,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,846 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs incurred for which reserves have been provided\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,417 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,014 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance proceeds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest accretion\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>603 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in discount rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>224 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revisions in estimates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,527 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ending balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,307 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnticipated payments and insurance proceeds of currently identified environmental remediation liabilities as of August 27, 2016 for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, as measured in current dollars, are reflected below (in thousands).\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> Fiscal year ended August\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estimated costs -

Annual proceeds of approximately $0.3 million are deposited into an escrow account which funds remediation and monitoring costs for three sites related to our former operations in Williamstown, Vermont. Annual proceeds received but not expended in the current year accumulate in this account and may be used in future years for costs related to this site through the year 2027. As of August 27, 2016, the balance in this escrow account, which is held in a trust and is not recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, was approximately $3.4 million. Also included in estimated insurance proceeds are amounts we are entitled to receive pursuant to legal settlements as reimbursements from three insurance companies for estimated costs at the site in Uvalde, Texas.\nOur nuclear garment decontamination facilities are licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC\u201d), or, in certain cases, by the applicable state agency, and are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. We also have nuclear garment decontamination facilities in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. These facilities are licensed and regulated by the respective country's applicable federal agency. There can be no assurance that such regulation will not lead to material disruptions in our garment decontamination business.\nFrom time to time, we are also subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of our business operations, including personal injury claims, customer contract matters, employment claims and environmental matters as described above.\nWhile it is impossible for us to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to contingent liabilities, including lawsuits and environmental contingencies, we believe that the aggregate amount of such liabilities, if any, in excess of amounts covered by insurance have been properly accrued in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. It is possible, however, that the future financial position and/or results of operations for any particular future period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or strategies related to these contingencies or changes out of our control.\nAcquisitions\nAs part of our business, we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other garment service companies. In recent years, we have typically paid for acquisitions with cash and may continue to do so in the future. To pay for an acquisition, we may use cash on hand, cash generated from operations or borrowings under our Credit Agreement, or we may pursue other forms of debt financing. Our ability to secure short-term and long-term debt financing in the future will depend on several factors, including our future profitability, our levels of debt and equity, and the overall credit and equity market environments.\nOn September 19, 2016, we completed an acquisition of Arrow Uniform ( Arrow\u201d) for approximately $122.0 million. The all-cash transaction is structured as an asset acquisition, with UniFirst acquiring substantially all of Arrow's assets and virtually none of its liabilities. Arrow, headquartered in Taylor, Michigan, provides uniform and facility service rental programs as well as direct sale uniform programs to a wide range of large and small customers. Arrow operates from 12 locations with nearly 700 employees in five Midwestern states.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments\nThe following information is presented as of August 27, 2016 (in thousands).\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> Payments Due by Fiscal Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 - 3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3 - 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retirement plan benefit payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,868 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,032 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,592 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,698 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,271 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,074 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have uncertain tax positions that are reserved totaling $3.7 million as of August 27, 2016 that are excluded from the above table as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority.\nWe have accrued $26.7 million in costs related to certain environmental obligations we have to address under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise. Refer to Environmental and Legal Contingencies\u201d, above for additional discussion on our environmental obligations.\nAs discussed above under Long-Term Debt and Borrowing Capacity\u201d, as of August 27, 2016, we had borrowing capacity of $250.0 million under our Credit Agreement, of which approximately $197.0 million was available for borrowing. Also, as of such date, we had no outstanding borrowings and letters of credit outstanding of $53.0 million. All letters of credit expire in less than one year. We expect to replace the Credit Agreement prior to its maturity with a new revolving line of credit on appropriate terms.\nIn January 2015, we entered into sixteen forward contracts to exchange Canadian dollars ( CAD\u201d) for U.S. dollars at fixed exchange rates in order to manage our exposure related to certain forecasted CAD denominated sales of one of our subsidiaries. The hedged transactions are specified as the first amount of CAD denominated revenues invoiced by one of our domestic subsidiaries each fiscal quarter, beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 and continuing through the second fiscal quarter of 2019. In total, we will sell approximately 31.0 million CAD at an average Canadian-dollar exchange rate of 0.7825 over these quarterly periods. We concluded that the forward contracts met the criteria to qualify as a cash flow hedge under US GAAP. Accordingly, we have reflected all changes in the fair value of the forward contracts in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, a component of shareholders' equity. Upon the maturity of each foreign exchange forward contract, the gain or loss on the contract will be recorded as an adjustment to revenues.\nAs of August 27, 2016, we had forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 17.1 million CAD outstanding and recorded the fair value of the contracts of $0.1 million in other long-term assets and $0.1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets with a corresponding gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income of $0.1 million, which was recorded net of tax. During the fiscal year ended August 27, 2016, we reclassified $0.2 million from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to revenue, related to the derivative financial instruments. The gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as of August 27, 2016 is expected to be reclassified to revenues prior to its maturity on February 22, 2019.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, our revenues and operating results have varied from quarter to quarter and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations have been due to a number of factors, including: general economic conditions in our markets; the timing of acquisitions and of commencing start-up operations and related costs; our effectiveness in integrating acquired businesses and start-up operations; the timing of nuclear plant outages; capital expenditures; seasonal rental and purchasing patterns of our customers; and price changes in response to competitive factors. In addition, our operating results historically have been lower during the second and fourth fiscal quarters than during the other quarters of the fiscal year. The operating results for any historical quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for an entire fiscal year or any other interim periods.\nEffects of Inflation\nIn general, we believe that our results of operations are not dependent on moderate changes in the inflation rate. Historically, we have been able to manage the impacts of more significant changes in inflation rates through our customer relationships, customer agreements that generally provide for price increases consistent with the rate of inflation, and continued focus on improvements of operational productivity.\nEnergy Costs\nSignificant increases in energy costs, specifically with respect to natural gas and gasoline, can materially affect our operating costs. During fiscal 2016, our energy costs, which include fuel, natural gas, and electricity, represented approximately 3.8% of our total revenue.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance for revenue recognition, which they have subsequently modified. This modified update provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods, and any interim periods within those annual periods, that begin after December 15, 2017 and will be required to be applied retrospectively, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard will be effective for us on August 26, 2018. We are currently evaluating the adoption method we will apply and the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance on consolidation requirements. This update changes the guidance with respect to the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard became effective for us on August 28, 2016. We expect that adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs. This update changes the guidance with respect to presenting such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard became effective for us on August 28, 2016. We expect that adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016, and is to be applied prospectively, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard will be effective for us on August 27, 2017. We expect that adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that require an entity to recognize adjustments made to provisional amounts that are identified in a business combination be recorded in the period such adjustments are determined, rather than retrospectively adjusting previously reported amounts. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, and is to be applied prospectively, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard became effective for us on August 28, 2016. We expect that adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance on the presentation of deferred income taxes. This update requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 and is to be applied prospectively, and may also be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this standard prospectively on February 27, 2016, and prior periods were not retroactively adjusted.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of certain financial assets and liabilities. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard will be effective for us on August 26, 2018. We expect that adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance that improves transparency and comparability among companies by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and by disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard will be effective for us on September 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance that simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 and, depending on the amendment, must be applied using a prospective transition method, retrospective transition method, modified retrospective transition method, prospectively and/or retroactively, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard will be effective for us on August 27, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBusiness Overview\nUniFirst Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, hereunder referred to as we\u201d, our\u201d, the Company\u201d, or UniFirst\u201d, is one of the largest providers of workplace uniforms and protective work wear clothing in the United States. We design, manufacture, personalize, rent, clean, deliver, and sell a wide range of uniforms and protective clothing, including shirts, pants, jackets, coveralls, lab coats, smocks, aprons and specialized protective wear, such as flame resistant and high visibility garments. We also rent and sell industrial wiping products, floor mats, facility service products and other non-garment items, and provide restroom and cleaning supplies and first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies, to a variety of manufacturers, retailers and service companies.\nWe serve businesses of all sizes in numerous industry categories. Typical customers include automobile service centers and dealers, delivery services, food and general merchandise retailers, food processors and service operations, light manufacturers, maintenance facilities, restaurants, service companies, soft and durable goods wholesalers, transportation companies, and others who require employee clothing for image, identification, protection or utility purposes. We also provide our customers with restroom and cleaning supplies, including air fresheners, paper products and hand soaps.\nAt certain specialized facilities, we also decontaminate and clean work clothes and other items that may have been exposed to radioactive materials and service special cleanroom protective wear and facilities. Typical customers for these specialized services include government agencies, research and development laboratories, high technology companies and utilities operating nuclear reactors.\nWe continue to expand into additional geographic markets through acquisitions and organic growth. We currently service over 300,000 customer locations in the United States, Canada and Europe from over 240 customer service, distribution and manufacturing facilities.\nUS GAAP establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information of those segments to be presented in interim financial reports issued to shareholders. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. Our chief operating decision-maker is our chief executive officer. We have six operating segments based on the information reviewed by our chief executive officer: US Rental and Cleaning, Canadian Rental and Cleaning, Manufacturing ( MFG\u201d), Specialty Garments Rental and Cleaning ( Specialty Garments\u201d), First Aid and Corporate. The US Rental and Cleaning and Canadian Rental and Cleaning operating segments have been combined to form the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. Refer to Note 15, Segment Reporting\u201d, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for our disclosure of segment information.\nThe US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment purchases, rents, cleans, delivers and sells, uniforms and protective clothing and non-garment items in the United States and Canada. The operations of the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment are referred to by us as our \u2018industrial laundry operations' and we refer to the locations related to this reporting segment as our \u2018industrial laundries'.\nThe MFG operating segment designs and manufactures uniforms and non-garment items primarily for the purpose of providing these goods to the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. The amounts reflected as revenues of MFG are primarily generated when goods are shipped from our manufacturing facilities, or subcontract manufacturers, to our other locations. These intercompany revenues are recorded at a transfer price which is typically in excess of the actual manufacturing cost. Products are carried in inventory and subsequently placed in service and amortized at this transfer price. On a consolidated basis, intercompany MFG revenues and MFG income are eliminated and the carrying value of inventories and rental merchandise in service is reduced to the manufacturing cost. Income before income taxes from MFG, net of the intercompany MFG elimination, offsets the merchandise amortization costs incurred by the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment as the merchandise costs of this reporting segment are amortized and recognized based on inventories purchased from MFG at the transfer price which is above our manufacturing cost.\nThe Corporate operating segment consists of costs associated with our distribution center, sales and marketing, information systems, engineering, materials management, manufacturing planning, finance, budgeting, human resources, other general and administrative costs and interest expense. The revenues generated from the Corporate operating segment represent certain direct sales made directly from our distribution center. The products sold by this operating segment are the same products rented and sold by the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. In the segment disclosures in Note 15, Segment Reporting\u201d, of our Consolidated Financial Statements, no assets or capital expenditures are presented for the Corporate operating segment as no assets are allocated to this operating segment in the information reviewed by our chief executive officer. However, depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets are reflected in income from operations and income before income taxes for the Corporate operating segment. The assets that give rise to this depreciation and amortization are included in the total assets of the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment as this is how they are tracked and reviewed by us.\nWe refer to our US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning, MFG, and Corporate segments combined as our Core Laundry Operations\u201d.\nThe Specialty Garments operating segment purchases, rents, cleans, delivers and sells, specialty garments and non-garment items primarily for nuclear and cleanroom applications and provides cleanroom cleaning services at limited customer locations. The First Aid operating segment sells first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies as well as maintains wholesale distribution and pill packaging operations.\nApproximately 91% of our revenues in fiscal 2016 were derived from US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning, and Corporate. A key driver of this business is the number of workers employed by our customers. Our revenues are directly impacted by fluctuations in these employment levels. Revenues from Specialty Garments, which accounted for approximately 6% of our 2016 revenues, increase during outages and refueling by nuclear power plants, as garment usage increases at these times. First Aid represented approximately 3% of our total revenue in fiscal 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with US GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on historical information, current trends, and information available from other sources. The actual results could differ from our estimates.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of our foreign operations is the local country's currency. Transaction gains and losses, including gains and losses on our intercompany transactions, are included in other (income) expense, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during each month of the fiscal year. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRevenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe recognize revenue from rental operations in the period in which the services are provided. Direct sale revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are performed or when the product is shipped. Our judgment and estimates are used in determining the collectability of accounts receivable and evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We consider specific accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and the age of outstanding balances as part of our evaluation. Changes in our estimates are reflected in the period they become known. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Material changes in our estimates may result in significant differences in the amount and timing of bad debt expense recognition for any given period. Our revenues do not include taxes we collect from our customers and remit to governmental authorities.\nInventories and Rental Merchandise in Service\nOur inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value, net of any reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. Judgments and estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to our customers or used in our rental operations. Historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both excess and obsolete inventories. If actual product demand and market conditions are less favorable than the amount we projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required. We use the first-in, first-out ( FIFO\u201d) method to value our inventories, which primarily consist of finished goods.\nRental merchandise in service is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives of the merchandise, which range from 6 to 36 months. In establishing estimated lives for merchandise in service, our management considers historical experience and the intended use of the merchandise. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of operating profit for any period if we make significant changes to our estimates.\nGoodwill, Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIn accordance with US GAAP, we do not amortize goodwill. Instead, current accounting guidance requires that companies test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis. In addition, US GAAP requires that companies test goodwill if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned below its carrying amount. Our evaluation considers changes in the operating environment, competitive information, market trends, operating performance and cash flow modeling.\nWe complete our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and there have been no impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.\nWe cannot predict future economic conditions and their impact on the Company or the future market value of our stock. A decline in our market capitalization and/or deterioration in general economic conditions could negatively and materially impact our assumptions and assessment of the fair value of our business. If general economic conditions or our financial performance deteriorate, we may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge in the future which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nProperty, plant and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on our estimates of the period that the assets will generate economic benefits. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired. There were no material impairments of property, plant and equipment, or definite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.\nInsurance\nWe self-insure for certain obligations related to health, workers' compensation, vehicles and general liability programs. We also purchase stop-loss insurance policies in certain instances to protect ourselves from catastrophic losses. Judgments and estimates are used in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for events that have occurred, but have not been reported. Our estimates consider historical claim experience and other factors. Our liabilities are based on our estimates, and, while we believe that our accruals are adequate, the ultimate liability may be significantly different from the amounts recorded. In certain cases where partial insurance coverage exists, we must estimate the portion of the liability that will be covered by existing insurance policies to arrive at our net expected liability. Receivables for insurance recoveries are recorded as assets, on an undiscounted basis. Changes in our claim experience, our ability to settle claims or other estimates and judgments we use could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any given period.\nEnvironmental and Other Contingencies\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of our business operations, including environmental matters, personal injury, customer contract matters and employment claims. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. We regularly consult with our attorneys and outside consultants, in our consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, before recording a contingent liability. We record accruals for environmental and other contingencies based on enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, our estimates of costs, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, and the input of our attorneys and outside consultants.\nThe estimated liability for environmental contingencies has been discounted as of August 27, 2016 using risk-free interest rates ranging from 1.6% to 2.3% over periods ranging from ten to thirty years. The estimated current costs, net of legal settlements with insurance carriers, have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at 3% per year. Changes in enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, our estimates of costs, risk-free interest rates, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, the input of our attorneys and outside consultants or other factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for our environmental and other contingent liabilities. Refer to Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion and analysis.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nUnder US GAAP, asset retirement obligations generally apply to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or the normal operation of a long-lived asset. Current accounting guidance requires that we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset.\nWe have recognized as a liability the present value of the estimated future costs to decommission our nuclear laundry facilities in accordance with US GAAP. We depreciate, on a straight-line basis, the amount added to property, plant and equipment and recognize accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the various remaining lives which range from approximately one to twenty-eight years.\nOur estimated liability has been based on historical experience in decommissioning nuclear laundry facilities, estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, external vendor estimates as to the cost to decommission these assets in the future, and federal and state regulatory requirements. The estimated current costs have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at 3% per year. The liability has been discounted using credit-adjusted risk-free rates that range from approximately 7.0% to 7.5%. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, estimated dates of decommissioning, changes in decommissioning costs, changes in federal or state regulatory guidance on the decommissioning of such facilities, or other changes in estimates. Changes due to revisions in our estimates will be recognized by adjusting the carrying amount of the liability and the related long-lived asset if the assets are still in service, or charged to expense in the period if the assets are no longer in service.\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan and other Pension Plans\nWe recognize pension expense on an accrual basis over our employees' estimated service periods. Pension expense is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements.\nThe calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires us to use a number of critical assumptions, including the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, the assumed discount rate, the assumed rate of compensation increases and life expectancy of participants. Changes in our assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual expense can differ from these assumptions. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.\nIncome Taxes\nWe compute income tax expense by jurisdiction based on our operations in each jurisdiction. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the amounts recognized for income tax and financial reporting purposes at currently enacted tax rates.\nWe are periodically reviewed by U.S. domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews typically include inquiries regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating our exposure associated with various filing positions, we have recorded estimated reserves. Refer to Note 4, Income Taxes\u201d, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our accounting for income taxes and uncertain tax positions for financial accounting purposes.\nWe have undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries of approximately $124.8 million as of August 27, 2016. We consider these undistributed earnings as indefinitely reinvested and therefore have not provided for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes. In addition, we have accumulated $54.9 million in cash outside the United States that is expected to be invested indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were distributed to the U.S. in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of our international subsidiaries were sold or transferred, we would likely be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, net of the impact of any available foreign tax credits as well as foreign withholding taxes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. taxes on these undistributed earnings.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents certain selected financial data,

We also rent industrial wiping products, floor mats, facility service products, other non-garment items, and provide restroom and cleaning supplies and first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies, to a variety of manufacturers, retailers and service companies. We have five reporting segments, US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning, MFG, Specialty Garments, First Aid and Corporate. We refer to the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning, MFG, and Corporate reporting segments combined as our Core Laundry Operations.\u201d\nCost of revenues include the amortization of rental merchandise in service and merchandise costs related to direct sales as well as labor and other production, service and delivery costs, and distribution costs associated with operating our Core Laundry Operations, Specialty Garments facilities, and First Aid locations. Selling and administrative costs include costs related to our sales and marketing functions as well as general and administrative costs associated with our corporate offices, non-operating environmental sites and operating locations including information systems, engineering, materials management, manufacturing planning, finance, budgeting, and human resources.\nWe have a substantial number of plants and conduct a significant portion of our business in energy producing regions in the U.S and Canada. The dramatic decrease in oil prices beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present has directly affected our customers in the oil industry as they have curtailed their level of operations. In addition, this decline has also had a corresponding effect on our customers in businesses which service or supply the oil industry as well as our customers in unrelated businesses located in areas which had benefited from the economic expansion generated by the robust growth driven by the higher oil prices in prior years. As a result, our organic growth has been impacted by elevated headcount reductions in our wearer base as well as increased lost accounts. We expect the headcount reductions that we continue to experience at a higher than normal rate will also have an impact on our organic growth into fiscal 2017. On the other hand, we have benefited from lower costs of the gasoline used to fuel our vehicles and the natural gas used to operate our plants. While it is difficult to quantify the positive and negative impacts on our future financial results from lower oil prices, the negative impact on our results from the cutbacks by our customers in the oil industry and other affected businesses have and will continue to outweigh the benefits from lower energy costs.\nThe cost of healthcare that we provide to our employees has grown over the last few years at a rate in excess of our revenue growth and as a result, has negatively impacted our operating results. In fiscal 2015, the Affordable Care Act ( ACA\u201d) required us to modify one of the healthcare plans we provided to our employees. Moreover, it is generally expected that healthcare costs in the United States will increase over the coming years at rates in excess of inflation. As a result of these factors, and depending on the effect of the modifications we have made, and may make in the future, to our employee healthcare plans and enrollment levels in those plans, we expect that our future operating results will continue to be further adversely impacted by increasing healthcare costs.\nWe are currently undertaking a company-wide initiative to update our customer relationship management ( CRM\u201d) systems. As of August 27, 2016, we have capitalized $47.9 million related to our CRM project ( Unity 20/20\u201d). Although we did not deploy this system in fiscal 2016, we continued to make investments in IT infrastructure, including headcount, to help support this and other technology initiatives that impacted our results of operations. In addition, our future operating results will be impacted by the eventual depreciation of our Unity 20/20 investment.\nOur business is subject to various state and federal regulations, including employment laws and regulations, minimum wage requirements, overtime requirements, working condition requirements, citizenship requirements, healthcare insurance mandates and other laws and regulations. We expect that our labor costs will rise in fiscal 2017 as a result of increases in state and local minimum wage levels as well as the recent update to the regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act which has expanded the number of employees entitled to overtime pay. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the updated standard on our labor costs but anticipates that our future operating results will be adversely impacted.\nA portion of our sales is derived from international markets, including Canada. Revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar represented approximately 7.9%, 8.4% and 9.8% of total consolidated revenues for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The operating results of our international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars and such results are affected by movements in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, a weaker Canadian dollar increases the costs to our Canadian operations of merchandise and other operational inputs that are sourced from outside Canada, which has the effect of reducing the operating margins of our Canadian business if we are unable to recover these additional costs through price adjustments with our Canadian customers. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted our consolidated revenues by 0.8%, 1.1% and 0.5%, respectively. These impacts were primarily driven by unfavorable fluctuations in the Canadian dollar. Our operating results in future years could be negatively impacted by any further devaluation, as compared to the U.S. dollar, of the Canadian dollar or any of the currencies of the other countries in which we operate.\nFiscal Year Ended August 27, 2016 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended August 29, 2015\nRevenues\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> August 27,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> August 29,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Laundry Operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,329,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,322,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Garments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Aid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total consolidated revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,468,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,456,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn fiscal 2016, our consolidated revenues increased by $11.4 million from the comparable period in 2015, or 0.8%. The increase in our consolidated revenues was primarily driven by the growth in our Core Laundry Operations, with revenues increasing to $1.329 billion in fiscal 2016 from $1.322 billion in fiscal 2015, or 0.5%. Excluding the negative effect of a weaker Canadian dollar of 0.7%, as well as the positive effect of acquisitions of 0.5%, organic growth was 0.7%. Organic growth consists primarily of new sales, price increases, and net changes in the wearer levels at our existing customers, offset by lost accounts. Our organic growth during fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by reductions in wearer levels at our customers that directly or indirectly support oil or other energy production in the United States and Canada.\nSpecialty Garments' revenue increased from $87.5 million in fiscal 2015 to $91.3 million in fiscal 2016, or 4.3%. This increase was primarily the result of strong growth from this segment's cleanroom and European operations. First Aid revenues increased 1.4%, from $46.8 million in fiscal 2015 to $47.4 million in fiscal 2016.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues increased as a percentage of revenues from 60.7%, or $884.7 million, in fiscal 2015 to 61.3% of revenues, or $900.4 million, in fiscal 2016. This increase was driven by higher costs as a percent of revenues in our Core Laundry Operations, including merchandise amortization, payroll and healthcare costs and other production costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower fuel costs associated with our fleet of delivery vehicles and lower natural gas costs used to operate our plants compared to the prior year period. In addition, our Specialty Garments segment partially offset this impact with lower overall costs of revenues as a percent of revenues.\nSelling and administrative expense\nOur selling and administrative expenses decreased to 19.4% of revenues, or $284.8 million in fiscal 2016, from 20.2% of revenues, or $294.4 million in fiscal 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the settlement of environmental litigation which resulted in a $15.9 million gain that was recorded as a reduction to selling and administrative expenses. The comparison of selling and administrative expenses also benefited from lower legal costs. These positive comparisons were offset in part by payroll and other administrative costs which were higher as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization\nOur depreciation and amortization expense was $81.6 million, or 5.6% of revenues, in fiscal 2016 compared to $77.1 million, or 5.3% of revenues, in fiscal 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense increased due to capital expenditure and acquisition activity in earlier periods.\nIncome from operations\nFor the year ended August 27, 2016, the changes in revenues in our Core Laundry Operations, Specialty Garments and First Aid segments, as well as the changes in our costs discussed above, resulted in the following changes in our income from operations:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> August 27,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> August 29,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Laundry Operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>186,074 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>187,586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,512 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Garments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Aid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(561 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-10.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total consolidated income from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>201,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther (income) expense\nOther (income) expense, which includes interest expense, interest income and foreign exchange loss, was income of $2.2 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to income of $0.9 million for fiscal 2015. The increase of $1.3 million was primarily due to foreign currency losses of $0.3 million in fiscal 2016 compared to foreign currency losses of $1.6 million during fiscal 2015.\nProvision for income taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 38.5% for fiscal 2016 compared to 38.2% for fiscal 2015. The increase in our effective tax rate was due to a change in the mix of our jurisdictional earnings.\nFiscal Year Ended August 29, 2015 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended August 30, 2014\nRevenues\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> August 29,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> August 30,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Laundry Operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,322,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,259,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Garments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,971 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-4.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Aid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,928 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total consolidated revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,456,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,394,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn fiscal 2015, our consolidated revenues increased by $61.7 million from the comparable period in 2014, or 4.4%. The increase in our consolidated revenues was primarily driven by the growth in our Core Laundry Operations, with revenues increasing to $1.322 billion in fiscal 2015 from $1.259 billion in fiscal 2014, or 5.0%. Excluding the negative effect of a weaker Canadian dollar of 0.9%, as well as the positive effect of acquisitions of 0.7%, organic growth was 5.2%. Organic growth consists primarily of new sales, price increases, and net changes in the wearer levels at our existing customers, offset by lost accounts. Organic growth in fiscal 2015 benefited from new account sales and annual price adjustments. These benefits were partially offset by decreases in net wearer counts at our existing customers primarily due to reductions at customers that directly or indirectly support oil or other energy production, as well as higher lost accounts compared to a year ago.\nSpecialty Garments' revenue decreased from $91.5 million in fiscal 2014 to $87.5 million in fiscal 2015, or 4.3%. This decrease was the result of reduced power reactor business in North American compared to a year ago as well as the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar and euro. This segment's results are often affected by the timing and length of its customers' power reactor outages as well as its project-based activities. First Aid revenues increased 6.5%, from $43.9 million in fiscal 2014 to $46.8 million in fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily due to solid performance by this segment's wholesale distribution and pill packaging operations.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues decreased as a percentage of revenues from 61.5%, or $858.3 million, in fiscal 2014 to 60.7% of revenues, or $884.7 million, in fiscal 2015. This decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to lower fuel costs associated with our fleet of delivery vehicles, lower natural gas costs and lower payroll related costs in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year. These costs were offset by higher merchandise amortization costs as a percentage of revenues during fiscal 2015 as compared to the prior year.\nSelling and administrative expense\nOur selling and administrative expenses increased to 20.2% of revenues, or $294.4 million in fiscal 2015, from 19.5% of revenues, or $271.6 million in fiscal 2014. This increase was primarily due to higher legal expenses and reserves related to miscellaneous legal matters, as well as higher cost related to IT infrastructure investments. In fiscal 2015, we also recorded an additional $3.0 million in expense related to our environmental contingency reserves compared to the prior year. This increase was due to a number of factors, including additional costs we expect to incur associated with the construction of a planned municipal transit station in the area of our Somerville site as well as the impact of lower interest rates on the discounting of our environmental liabilities in the prior year.\nDepreciation and amortization\nOur depreciation and amortization expense was $77.1 million, or 5.3% of revenues, in fiscal 2015 compared to $71.8 million, or 5.1% of revenues, in fiscal 2014. Depreciation and amortization expense increased due to capital expenditure and acquisition activity in earlier periods.\nIncome from operations\nFor the year ended August 29, 2015, the changes in revenues in our Core Laundry Operations, Specialty Garments and First Aid segments, as well as the changes in our costs discussed above, resulted in the following changes in our income from operations:\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> August 29,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> August 30,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Laundry Operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>187,586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>182,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Garments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Aid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total consolidated income from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>193,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther (income) expense\nOther (income) expense, which includes interest expense, interest income and foreign exchange loss, was income of $0.9 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to income of $2.1 million for fiscal 2014. The decrease of $1.2 million in other income was primarily the result of foreign currency losses of approximately $1.6 million during fiscal 2015 compared to foreign currency losses of approximately $0.3 million during fiscal 2014.\nProvision for income taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 38.2% for fiscal 2015 compared to 38.6% for fiscal 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in state income taxes as well as a change in the mix of jurisdictional earnings in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $363.8 million as of August 27, 2016, an increase of $87.2 million from $276.6 million as of August 29, 2015. Our working capital was $625.0 million as of August 27, 2016 compared to $477.7 million as of August 29, 2015. Subsequent to August 27, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Arrow Uniform for a cash purchase price of approximately $122.0 million. We generated $207.6 million and $226.9 million in cash from operating activities in the fiscal years ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, respectively. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balances, our cash generated from future operations and amounts available under our Credit Agreement (defined below) will be sufficient to meet our current anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nWe have accumulated $54.9 million in cash outside the United States that is expected to be invested indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were distributed to the U.S. in the form of dividends, we would likely be subject to additional U.S. income taxes. However, we do not believe that any resulting taxes payable would have a material impact on our liquidity.\nCash flows provided by operating activities have historically been the primary source of our liquidity. We generally use these cash flows to fund most, if not all, of our operations, capital expenditure and acquisition activities as well as dividends on our common stock. We may also use cash flows provided by operating activities, as well as proceeds from loans payable and long-term debt, to fund growth and acquisition opportunities, as well as other cash requirements.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended August 27, 2016 was $207.6 million, a decrease of $19.3 million from the prior fiscal year when cash provided by operating activities was $226.9 million. This net decrease was partially driven by the timing of income tax payments and the impact of changes in deferred income taxes. In addition, the comparison of cash provided by operating activities was impacted by a settlement related to environmental litigation the Company entered into in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 which resulted in a gain of $15.9 million booked as a reduction of selling and administrative expenses. A significant portion of the funds related to this settlement were received in September 2016 and, therefore, did not translate into operating cash flow during fiscal 2016.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended August 27, 2016 was $114.7 million, a decrease of 9.6 million from the prior fiscal year when cash used in investing activities was $124.3 million. The net decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by a decrease in cash outflows of $5.8 million for the acquisition of businesses as well as a decrease in cash outflow of $2.9 million for capital expenditures.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended August 27, 2016 was $5.6 million compared to cash used in financing activities of $6.3 million for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2015. This change was primarily due to a net decrease of cash outflows of $4.9 million related to proceeds and payments on loans payable and long-term debt in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. This decrease was offset in part by a decrease in proceeds received from the exercise of share based awards.\nLong-term debt and borrowing capacity\nOn April 11, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of banks, which matures on April 11, 2021. The Credit Agreement amended and restated our prior $250.0 million revolving credit agreement, which was scheduled to mature on May 4, 2016. Under the Credit Agreement, we are able to borrow funds at variable interest rates based on, at our election, the Eurodollar rate or a base rate, plus in each case a spread based on our consolidated funded debt ratio. Availability of credit requires compliance with certain financial and other covenants, including a maximum consolidated funded debt ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement. We test our compliance with these financial covenants on a fiscal quarterly basis. As of August 27, 2016, the interest rates applicable to our borrowings under the Credit Agreement would be calculated as LIBOR plus 75 basis points at the time of the respective borrowing. As of August 27, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings and had outstanding letters of credit amounting to $53.0 million, leaving $197.0 million available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement.\nAs of August 27, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nIn January 2015, we entered into sixteen forward contracts to exchange Canadian dollars ( CAD\u201d) for U.S. dollars at fixed exchange rates in order to manage our exposure related to certain forecasted CAD denominated sales of one of our subsidiaries. The hedged transactions are specified as the first amount of CAD denominated revenues invoiced by one of our domestic subsidiaries each fiscal quarter, beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 and continuing through the second fiscal quarter of 2019. In total, we will sell approximately 31.0 million CAD at an average Canadian-dollar exchange rate of 0.7825 over these quarterly periods. We concluded that the forward contracts met the criteria to qualify as a cash flow hedge under US GAAP. Accordingly, we have reflected all changes in the fair value of the forward contracts in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, a component of shareholders' equity. Upon the maturity of each foreign exchange forward contract, the gain or loss on the contract will be recorded as an adjustment to revenues.\nAs of August 27, 2016, we had forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 17.1 million CAD outstanding and recorded the fair value of the contracts of $0.1 million in other long-term assets and $0.1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets with a corresponding gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income of $0.1 million, which was recorded net of tax. During the fiscal year ended August 27, 2016, we reclassified $0.2 million from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to revenue, related to the derivative financial instruments. The gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as of August 27, 2016 is expected to be reclassified to revenues prior to its maturity on February 22, 2019.\nEnvironmental and Legal Contingencies\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other substances. In particular, industrial laundries currently use and must dispose of detergent waste water and other residues, and, in the past, used perchloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents. We are attentive to the environmental concerns surrounding the disposal of these materials and have, through the years, taken measures to avoid their improper disposal. Over the years, we have settled, or contributed to the settlement of, actions or claims brought against us relating to the disposal of hazardous materials and there can be no assurance that we will not have to expend material amounts to remediate the consequences of any such disposal in the future.\nUS GAAP requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. We regularly consult with attorneys and outside consultants in our consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances before recording a contingent liability. Changes in enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, our estimates of costs, risk-free interest rates, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, the input of our attorneys and outside consultants or other factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for our environmental and other contingent liabilities.\nUnder environmental laws, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on, or in, or emanating from such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. There can be no assurances that acquired or leased locations have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon our Company under such laws or expose our Company to third party actions such as tort suits. We continue to address environmental conditions under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise with respect to sites located in or related to Woburn, Massachusetts, Somerville, Massachusetts, Springfield, Massachusetts, Uvalde, Texas, Stockton, California, three sites related to former operations in Williamstown, Vermont, as well as sites located in Goldsboro, North Carolina, Wilmington, North Carolina, Landover, Maryland and Syracuse, New York.\nWe have accrued certain costs related to the sites described above as it has been determined that the costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We have potential exposure related to a parcel of land (the Central Area\u201d) related to the Woburn, Massachusetts site mentioned above. Currently, the consent decree for the Woburn site does not define or require any remediation work in the Central Area. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA\u201d) has provided us and other signatories to the consent decree with comments on the design and implementation of groundwater and soil remedies at the Woburn site and investigation of environmental conditions in the Central Area. We, and other signatories, have implemented and proposed to do additional work at the Woburn site but many of the EPA's comments remain to be resolved. We have accrued costs to perform certain work responsive to EPA's comments. We have implemented mitigation measures and continue to monitor environmental conditions at the Somerville, Massachusetts site. In addition, we have received demands from the local transit authority for reimbursement of certain costs associated with its construction of a new municipal transit station in the area of our Somerville site. This station is part of a planned extension of the transit system. Due to cost projections of the extension which now substantially exceed original estimates, the local transit authority has placed the extension on hold pending its redesign and receipt of related state and federal approvals and funding increases. We have reserved for costs in connection with this matter; however, in light of the uncertainties associated with this matter, these costs and the related reserve may change. We have also received notice that the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection is conducting an audit of our investigation and remediation work with respect to the Somerville site.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company entered into a settlement related to environmental litigation which resulted in a $15.9 million gain that was recorded as a reduction of selling and administrative expenses. This gain consisted of amounts previously received but not recognized into income as well as amounts that the Company received in September 2016.\nWe routinely review and evaluate sites that may require remediation and monitoring and determine our estimated costs based on various estimates and assumptions. These estimates are developed using our internal sources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on:\n \u2022 Management's judgment and experience in remediating and monitoring our sites; \n \u2022 Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation and monitoring; \n \u2022 The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) who may be liable for remediation and monitoring of a specific site; and \n \u2022 The typical allocation of costs among PRPs. \nThere is usually a range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with each site. In accordance with US GAAP, our accruals represent the amount within the range that we believe is the best estimate or the low end of a range of estimates if no point within the range is a better estimate. When we believe that both the amount of a particular liability and the timing of the payments are reliably determinable, we adjust the cost in current dollars using a rate of 3% for inflation until the time of expected payment and discount the cost to present value using current risk-free interest rates. As of August 27, 2016, the risk-free interest rates we utilized ranged from 1.6% to 2.3%.\nFor environmental liabilities that have been discounted, we include interest accretion, based on the effective interest method, in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The changes to the amounts of our environmental liabilities for the years ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> August 27,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> August 29,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,846 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs incurred for which reserves have been provided\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,417 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,014 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance proceeds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest accretion\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>603 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in discount rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>224 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revisions in estimates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,527 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ending balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,307 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnticipated payments and insurance proceeds of currently identified environmental remediation liabilities as of August 27, 2016 for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, as measured in current dollars, are reflected below (in thousands).\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> Fiscal year ended August\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estimated costs -

Annual proceeds of approximately $0.3 million are deposited into an escrow account which funds remediation and monitoring costs for three sites related to our former operations in Williamstown, Vermont. Annual proceeds received but not expended in the current year accumulate in this account and may be used in future years for costs related to this site through the year 2027. As of August 27, 2016, the balance in this escrow account, which is held in a trust and is not recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, was approximately $3.4 million. Also included in estimated insurance proceeds are amounts we are entitled to receive pursuant to legal settlements as reimbursements from three insurance companies for estimated costs at the site in Uvalde, Texas.\nOur nuclear garment decontamination facilities are licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC\u201d), or, in certain cases, by the applicable state agency, and are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. We also have nuclear garment decontamination facilities in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. These facilities are licensed and regulated by the respective country's applicable federal agency. There can be no assurance that such regulation will not lead to material disruptions in our garment decontamination business.\nFrom time to time, we are also subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of our business operations, including personal injury claims, customer contract matters, employment claims and environmental matters as described above.\nWhile it is impossible for us to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to contingent liabilities, including lawsuits and environmental contingencies, we believe that the aggregate amount of such liabilities, if any, in excess of amounts covered by insurance have been properly accrued in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. It is possible, however, that the future financial position and/or results of operations for any particular future period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or strategies related to these contingencies or changes out of our control.\nAcquisitions\nAs part of our business, we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other garment service companies. In recent years, we have typically paid for acquisitions with cash and may continue to do so in the future. To pay for an acquisition, we may use cash on hand, cash generated from operations or borrowings under our Credit Agreement, or we may pursue other forms of debt financing. Our ability to secure short-term and long-term debt financing in the future will depend on several factors, including our future profitability, our levels of debt and equity, and the overall credit and equity market environments.\nOn September 19, 2016, we completed an acquisition of Arrow Uniform ( Arrow\u201d) for approximately $122.0 million. The all-cash transaction is structured as an asset acquisition, with UniFirst acquiring substantially all of Arrow's assets and virtually none of its liabilities. Arrow, headquartered in Taylor, Michigan, provides uniform and facility service rental programs as well as direct sale uniform programs to a wide range of large and small customers. Arrow operates from 12 locations with nearly 700 employees in five Midwestern states.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments\nThe following information is presented as of August 27, 2016 (in thousands).\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> Payments Due by Fiscal Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 - 3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3 - 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retirement plan benefit payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,868 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,032 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,592 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,698 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,271 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,074 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have uncertain tax positions that are reserved totaling $3.7 million as of August 27, 2016 that are excluded from the above table as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority.\nWe have accrued $26.7 million in costs related to certain environmental obligations we have to address under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise. Refer to Environmental and Legal Contingencies\u201d, above for additional discussion on our environmental obligations.\nAs discussed above under Long-Term Debt and Borrowing Capacity\u201d, as of August 27, 2016, we had borrowing capacity of $250.0 million under our Credit Agreement, of which approximately $197.0 million was available for borrowing. Also, as of such date, we had no outstanding borrowings and letters of credit outstanding of $53.0 million. All letters of credit expire in less than one year. We expect to replace the Credit Agreement prior to its maturity with a new revolving line of credit on appropriate terms.\nIn January 2015, we entered into sixteen forward contracts to exchange Canadian dollars ( CAD\u201d) for U.S. dollars at fixed exchange rates in order to manage our exposure related to certain forecasted CAD denominated sales of one of our subsidiaries. The hedged transactions are specified as the first amount of CAD denominated revenues invoiced by one of our domestic subsidiaries each fiscal quarter, beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 and continuing through the second fiscal quarter of 2019. In total, we will sell approximately 31.0 million CAD at an average Canadian-dollar exchange rate of 0.7825 over these quarterly periods. We concluded that the forward contracts met the criteria to qualify as a cash flow hedge under US GAAP. Accordingly, we have reflected all changes in the fair value of the forward contracts in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, a component of shareholders' equity. Upon the maturity of each foreign exchange forward contract, the gain or loss on the contract will be recorded as an adjustment to revenues.\nAs of August 27, 2016, we had forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 17.1 million CAD outstanding and recorded the fair value of the contracts of $0.1 million in other long-term assets and $0.1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets with a corresponding gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income of $0.1 million, which was recorded net of tax. During the fiscal year ended August 27, 2016, we reclassified $0.2 million from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to revenue, related to the derivative financial instruments. The gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as of August 27, 2016 is expected to be reclassified to revenues prior to its maturity on February 22, 2019.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, our revenues and operating results have varied from quarter to quarter and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations have been due to a number of factors, including: general economic conditions in our markets; the timing of acquisitions and of commencing start-up operations and related costs; our effectiveness in integrating acquired businesses and start-up operations; the timing of nuclear plant outages; capital expenditures; seasonal rental and purchasing patterns of our customers; and price changes in response to competitive factors. In addition, our operating results historically have been lower during the second and fourth fiscal quarters than during the other quarters of the fiscal year. The operating results for any historical quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for an entire fiscal year or any other interim periods.\nEffects of Inflation\nIn general, we believe that our results of operations are not dependent on moderate changes in the inflation rate. Historically, we have been able to manage the impacts of more significant changes in inflation rates through our customer relationships, customer agreements that generally provide for price increases consistent with the rate of inflation, and continued focus on improvements of operational productivity.\nEnergy Costs\nSignificant increases in energy costs, specifically with respect to natural gas and gasoline, can materially affect our operating costs. During fiscal 2016, our energy costs, which include fuel, natural gas, and electricity, represented approximately 3.8% of our total revenue.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance for revenue recognition, which they have subsequently modified. This modified update provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods, and any interim periods within those annual periods, that begin after December 15, 2017 and will be required to be applied retrospectively, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard will be effective for us on August 26, 2018. We are currently evaluating the adoption method we will apply and the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance on consolidation requirements. This update changes the guidance with respect to the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard became effective for us on August 28, 2016. We expect that adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs. This update changes the guidance with respect to presenting such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard became effective for us on August 28, 2016. We expect that adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016, and is to be applied prospectively, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard will be effective for us on August 27, 2017. We expect that adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that require an entity to recognize adjustments made to provisional amounts that are identified in a business combination be recorded in the period such adjustments are determined, rather than retrospectively adjusting previously reported amounts. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, and is to be applied prospectively, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard became effective for us on August 28, 2016. We expect that adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance on the presentation of deferred income taxes. This update requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 and is to be applied prospectively, and may also be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this standard prospectively on February 27, 2016, and prior periods were not retroactively adjusted.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of certain financial assets and liabilities. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard will be effective for us on August 26, 2018. We expect that adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance that improves transparency and comparability among companies by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and by disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard will be effective for us on September 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance that simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 and, depending on the amendment, must be applied using a prospective transition method, retrospective transition method, modified retrospective transition method, prospectively and/or retroactively, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard will be effective for us on August 27, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBusiness Overview\nUniFirst Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, hereunder referred to as we\u201d, our\u201d, the Company\u201d, or UniFirst\u201d, is one of the largest providers of workplace uniforms and protective work wear clothing in the United States. We design, manufacture, personalize, rent, clean, deliver, and sell a wide range of uniforms and protective clothing, including shirts, pants, jackets, coveralls, lab coats, smocks, aprons and specialized protective wear, such as flame resistant and high visibility garments. We also rent and sell industrial wiping products, floor mats, facility service products and other non-garment items, and provide restroom and cleaning supplies and first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies, to a variety of manufacturers, retailers and service companies.\nWe serve businesses of all sizes in numerous industry categories. Typical customers include automobile service centers and dealers, delivery services, food and general merchandise retailers, food processors and service operations, light manufacturers, maintenance facilities, restaurants, service companies, soft and durable goods wholesalers, transportation companies, and others who require employee clothing for image, identification, protection or utility purposes. We also provide our customers with restroom and cleaning supplies, including air fresheners, paper products and hand soaps.\nAt certain specialized facilities, we also decontaminate and clean work clothes and other items that may have been exposed to radioactive materials and service special cleanroom protective wear and facilities. Typical customers for these specialized services include government agencies, research and development laboratories, high technology companies and utilities operating nuclear reactors.\nWe continue to expand into additional geographic markets through acquisitions and organic growth. We currently service over 300,000 customer locations in the United States, Canada and Europe from over 240 customer service, distribution and manufacturing facilities.\nUS GAAP establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information of those segments to be presented in interim financial reports issued to shareholders. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. Our chief operating decision-maker is our chief executive officer. We have six operating segments based on the information reviewed by our chief executive officer: US Rental and Cleaning, Canadian Rental and Cleaning, Manufacturing ( MFG\u201d), Specialty Garments Rental and Cleaning ( Specialty Garments\u201d), First Aid and Corporate. The US Rental and Cleaning and Canadian Rental and Cleaning operating segments have been combined to form the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. Refer to Note 15, Segment Reporting\u201d, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for our disclosure of segment information.\nThe US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment purchases, rents, cleans, delivers and sells, uniforms and protective clothing and non-garment items in the United States and Canada. The operations of the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment are referred to by us as our \u2018industrial laundry operations' and we refer to the locations related to this reporting segment as our \u2018industrial laundries'.\nThe MFG operating segment designs and manufactures uniforms and non-garment items primarily for the purpose of providing these goods to the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. The amounts reflected as revenues of MFG are primarily generated when goods are shipped from our manufacturing facilities, or subcontract manufacturers, to our other locations. These intercompany revenues are recorded at a transfer price which is typically in excess of the actual manufacturing cost. Products are carried in inventory and subsequently placed in service and amortized at this transfer price. On a consolidated basis, intercompany MFG revenues and MFG income are eliminated and the carrying value of inventories and rental merchandise in service is reduced to the manufacturing cost. Income before income taxes from MFG, net of the intercompany MFG elimination, offsets the merchandise amortization costs incurred by the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment as the merchandise costs of this reporting segment are amortized and recognized based on inventories purchased from MFG at the transfer price which is above our manufacturing cost.\nThe Corporate operating segment consists of costs associated with our distribution center, sales and marketing, information systems, engineering, materials management, manufacturing planning, finance, budgeting, human resources, other general and administrative costs and interest expense. The revenues generated from the Corporate operating segment represent certain direct sales made directly from our distribution center. The products sold by this operating segment are the same products rented and sold by the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment. In the segment disclosures in Note 15, Segment Reporting\u201d, of our Consolidated Financial Statements, no assets or capital expenditures are presented for the Corporate operating segment as no assets are allocated to this operating segment in the information reviewed by our chief executive officer. However, depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets are reflected in income from operations and income before income taxes for the Corporate operating segment. The assets that give rise to this depreciation and amortization are included in the total assets of the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning reporting segment as this is how they are tracked and reviewed by us.\nWe refer to our US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning, MFG, and Corporate segments combined as our Core Laundry Operations\u201d.\nThe Specialty Garments operating segment purchases, rents, cleans, delivers and sells, specialty garments and non-garment items primarily for nuclear and cleanroom applications and provides cleanroom cleaning services at limited customer locations. The First Aid operating segment sells first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies as well as maintains wholesale distribution and pill packaging operations.\nApproximately 91% of our revenues in fiscal 2016 were derived from US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning, and Corporate. A key driver of this business is the number of workers employed by our customers. Our revenues are directly impacted by fluctuations in these employment levels. Revenues from Specialty Garments, which accounted for approximately 6% of our 2016 revenues, increase during outages and refueling by nuclear power plants, as garment usage increases at these times. First Aid represented approximately 3% of our total revenue in fiscal 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with US GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on historical information, current trends, and information available from other sources. The actual results could differ from our estimates.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of our foreign operations is the local country's currency. Transaction gains and losses, including gains and losses on our intercompany transactions, are included in other (income) expense, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during each month of the fiscal year. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRevenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe recognize revenue from rental operations in the period in which the services are provided. Direct sale revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are performed or when the product is shipped. Our judgment and estimates are used in determining the collectability of accounts receivable and evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We consider specific accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and the age of outstanding balances as part of our evaluation. Changes in our estimates are reflected in the period they become known. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Material changes in our estimates may result in significant differences in the amount and timing of bad debt expense recognition for any given period. Our revenues do not include taxes we collect from our customers and remit to governmental authorities.\nInventories and Rental Merchandise in Service\nOur inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value, net of any reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. Judgments and estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to our customers or used in our rental operations. Historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both excess and obsolete inventories. If actual product demand and market conditions are less favorable than the amount we projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required. We use the first-in, first-out ( FIFO\u201d) method to value our inventories, which primarily consist of finished goods.\nRental merchandise in service is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives of the merchandise, which range from 6 to 36 months. In establishing estimated lives for merchandise in service, our management considers historical experience and the intended use of the merchandise. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of operating profit for any period if we make significant changes to our estimates.\nGoodwill, Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIn accordance with US GAAP, we do not amortize goodwill. Instead, current accounting guidance requires that companies test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis. In addition, US GAAP requires that companies test goodwill if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned below its carrying amount. Our evaluation considers changes in the operating environment, competitive information, market trends, operating performance and cash flow modeling.\nWe complete our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and there have been no impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.\nWe cannot predict future economic conditions and their impact on the Company or the future market value of our stock. A decline in our market capitalization and/or deterioration in general economic conditions could negatively and materially impact our assumptions and assessment of the fair value of our business. If general economic conditions or our financial performance deteriorate, we may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge in the future which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nProperty, plant and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on our estimates of the period that the assets will generate economic benefits. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired. There were no material impairments of property, plant and equipment, or definite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.\nInsurance\nWe self-insure for certain obligations related to health, workers' compensation, vehicles and general liability programs. We also purchase stop-loss insurance policies in certain instances to protect ourselves from catastrophic losses. Judgments and estimates are used in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for events that have occurred, but have not been reported. Our estimates consider historical claim experience and other factors. Our liabilities are based on our estimates, and, while we believe that our accruals are adequate, the ultimate liability may be significantly different from the amounts recorded. In certain cases where partial insurance coverage exists, we must estimate the portion of the liability that will be covered by existing insurance policies to arrive at our net expected liability. Receivables for insurance recoveries are recorded as assets, on an undiscounted basis. Changes in our claim experience, our ability to settle claims or other estimates and judgments we use could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any given period.\nEnvironmental and Other Contingencies\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of our business operations, including environmental matters, personal injury, customer contract matters and employment claims. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. We regularly consult with our attorneys and outside consultants, in our consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, before recording a contingent liability. We record accruals for environmental and other contingencies based on enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, our estimates of costs, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, and the input of our attorneys and outside consultants.\nThe estimated liability for environmental contingencies has been discounted as of August 27, 2016 using risk-free interest rates ranging from 1.6% to 2.3% over periods ranging from ten to thirty years. The estimated current costs, net of legal settlements with insurance carriers, have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at 3% per year. Changes in enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, our estimates of costs, risk-free interest rates, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, the input of our attorneys and outside consultants or other factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for our environmental and other contingent liabilities. Refer to Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion and analysis.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nUnder US GAAP, asset retirement obligations generally apply to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or the normal operation of a long-lived asset. Current accounting guidance requires that we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset.\nWe have recognized as a liability the present value of the estimated future costs to decommission our nuclear laundry facilities in accordance with US GAAP. We depreciate, on a straight-line basis, the amount added to property, plant and equipment and recognize accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the various remaining lives which range from approximately one to twenty-eight years.\nOur estimated liability has been based on historical experience in decommissioning nuclear laundry facilities, estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, external vendor estimates as to the cost to decommission these assets in the future, and federal and state regulatory requirements. The estimated current costs have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at 3% per year. The liability has been discounted using credit-adjusted risk-free rates that range from approximately 7.0% to 7.5%. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets, estimated dates of decommissioning, changes in decommissioning costs, changes in federal or state regulatory guidance on the decommissioning of such facilities, or other changes in estimates. Changes due to revisions in our estimates will be recognized by adjusting the carrying amount of the liability and the related long-lived asset if the assets are still in service, or charged to expense in the period if the assets are no longer in service.\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan and other Pension Plans\nWe recognize pension expense on an accrual basis over our employees' estimated service periods. Pension expense is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements.\nThe calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires us to use a number of critical assumptions, including the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, the assumed discount rate, the assumed rate of compensation increases and life expectancy of participants. Changes in our assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual expense can differ from these assumptions. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.\nIncome Taxes\nWe compute income tax expense by jurisdiction based on our operations in each jurisdiction. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the amounts recognized for income tax and financial reporting purposes at currently enacted tax rates.\nWe are periodically reviewed by U.S. domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews typically include inquiries regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating our exposure associated with various filing positions, we have recorded estimated reserves. Refer to Note 4, Income Taxes\u201d, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our accounting for income taxes and uncertain tax positions for financial accounting purposes.\nWe have undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries of approximately $124.8 million as of August 27, 2016. We consider these undistributed earnings as indefinitely reinvested and therefore have not provided for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes. In addition, we have accumulated $54.9 million in cash outside the United States that is expected to be invested indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were distributed to the U.S. in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of our international subsidiaries were sold or transferred, we would likely be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, net of the impact of any available foreign tax credits as well as foreign withholding taxes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. taxes on these undistributed earnings.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents certain selected financial data, including the percentage of revenues represented by each item, for our three fiscal years ended August 27, 2016, August 29, 2015 and August 30, 2014.\n\n (1) Exclusive of depreciation on our property, plant and equipment and amortization of our intangible assets. \nRevenues and income (loss) from operations by reporting segment for the three fiscal years ended August 27, 2016, August 29, 2015, and August 30, 2014 are presented in the following table. Refer to Note 15, Segment Reporting\u201d, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our reporting segments.\n\nGeneral\nWe derive our revenues through the design, manufacture, personalization, rental, cleaning, delivering, and selling of a wide range of uniforms and protective clothing, including shirts, pants, jackets, coveralls, lab coats, smocks and aprons and specialized protective wear, such as flame resistant and high visibility garments. We also rent industrial wiping products, floor mats, facility service products, other non-garment items, and provide restroom and cleaning supplies and first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies, to a variety of manufacturers, retailers and service companies. We have five reporting segments, US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning, MFG, Specialty Garments, First Aid and Corporate. We refer to the US and Canadian Rental and Cleaning, MFG, and Corporate reporting segments combined as our Core Laundry Operations.\u201d\nCost of revenues include the amortization of rental merchandise in service and merchandise costs related to direct sales as well as labor and other production, service and delivery costs, and distribution costs associated with operating our Core Laundry Operations, Specialty Garments facilities, and First Aid locations. Selling and administrative costs include costs related to our sales and marketing functions as well as general and administrative costs associated with our corporate offices, non-operating environmental sites and operating locations including information systems, engineering, materials management, manufacturing planning, finance, budgeting, and human resources.\nWe have a substantial number of plants and conduct a significant portion of our business in energy producing regions in the U.S and Canada. The dramatic decrease in oil prices beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present has directly affected our customers in the oil industry as they have curtailed their level of operations. In addition, this decline has also had a corresponding effect on our customers in businesses which service or supply the oil industry as well as our customers in unrelated businesses located in areas which had benefited from the economic expansion generated by the robust growth driven by the higher oil prices in prior years. As a result, our organic growth has been impacted by elevated headcount reductions in our wearer base as well as increased lost accounts. We expect the headcount reductions that we continue to experience at a higher than normal rate will also have an impact on our organic growth into fiscal 2017. On the other hand, we have benefited from lower costs of the gasoline used to fuel our vehicles and the natural gas used to operate our plants. While it is difficult to quantify the positive and negative impacts on our future financial results from lower oil prices, the negative impact on our results from the cutbacks by our customers in the oil industry and other affected businesses have and will continue to outweigh the benefits from lower energy costs.\nThe cost of healthcare that we provide to our employees has grown over the last few years at a rate in excess of our revenue growth and as a result, has negatively impacted our operating results. In fiscal 2015, the Affordable Care Act ( ACA\u201d) required us to modify one of the healthcare plans we provided to our employees. Moreover, it is generally expected that healthcare costs in the United States will increase over the coming years at rates in excess of inflation. As a result of these factors, and depending on the effect of the modifications we have made, and may make in the future, to our employee healthcare plans and enrollment levels in those plans, we expect that our future operating results will continue to be further adversely impacted by increasing healthcare costs.\nWe are currently undertaking a company-wide initiative to update our customer relationship management ( CRM\u201d) systems. As of August 27, 2016, we have capitalized $47.9 million related to our CRM project ( Unity 20/20\u201d). Although we did not deploy this system in fiscal 2016, we continued to make investments in IT infrastructure, including headcount, to help support this and other technology initiatives that impacted our results of operations. In addition, our future operating results will be impacted by the eventual depreciation of our Unity 20/20 investment.\nOur business is subject to various state and federal regulations, including employment laws and regulations, minimum wage requirements, overtime requirements, working condition requirements, citizenship requirements, healthcare insurance mandates and other laws and regulations. We expect that our labor costs will rise in fiscal 2017 as a result of increases in state and local minimum wage levels as well as the recent update to the regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act which has expanded the number of employees entitled to overtime pay. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the updated standard on our labor costs but anticipates that our future operating results will be adversely impacted.\nA portion of our sales is derived from international markets, including Canada. Revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar represented approximately 7.9%, 8.4% and 9.8% of total consolidated revenues for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The operating results of our international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars and such results are affected by movements in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, a weaker Canadian dollar increases the costs to our Canadian operations of merchandise and other operational inputs that are sourced from outside Canada, which has the effect of reducing the operating margins of our Canadian business if we are unable to recover these additional costs through price adjustments with our Canadian customers. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted our consolidated revenues by 0.8%, 1.1% and 0.5%, respectively. These impacts were primarily driven by unfavorable fluctuations in the Canadian dollar. Our operating results in future years could be negatively impacted by any further devaluation, as compared to the U.S. dollar, of the Canadian dollar or any of the currencies of the other countries in which we operate.\nFiscal Year Ended August 27, 2016 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended August 29, 2015\nRevenues\n\nIn fiscal 2016, our consolidated revenues increased by $11.4 million from the comparable period in 2015, or 0.8%. The increase in our consolidated revenues was primarily driven by the growth in our Core Laundry Operations, with revenues increasing to $1.329 billion in fiscal 2016 from $1.322 billion in fiscal 2015, or 0.5%. Excluding the negative effect of a weaker Canadian dollar of 0.7%, as well as the positive effect of acquisitions of 0.5%, organic growth was 0.7%. Organic growth consists primarily of new sales, price increases, and net changes in the wearer levels at our existing customers, offset by lost accounts. Our organic growth during fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by reductions in wearer levels at our customers that directly or indirectly support oil or other energy production in the United States and Canada.\nSpecialty Garments' revenue increased from $87.5 million in fiscal 2015 to $91.3 million in fiscal 2016, or 4.3%. This increase was primarily the result of strong growth from this segment's cleanroom and European operations. First Aid revenues increased 1.4%, from $46.8 million in fiscal 2015 to $47.4 million in fiscal 2016.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues increased as a percentage of revenues from 60.7%, or $884.7 million, in fiscal 2015 to 61.3% of revenues, or $900.4 million, in fiscal 2016. This increase was driven by higher costs as a percent of revenues in our Core Laundry Operations, including merchandise amortization, payroll and healthcare costs and other production costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower fuel costs associated with our fleet of delivery vehicles and lower natural gas costs used to operate our plants compared to the prior year period. In addition, our Specialty Garments segment partially offset this impact with lower overall costs of revenues as a percent of revenues.\nSelling and administrative expense\nOur selling and administrative expenses decreased to 19.4% of revenues, or $284.8 million in fiscal 2016, from 20.2% of revenues, or $294.4 million in fiscal 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the settlement of environmental litigation which resulted in a $15.9 million gain that was recorded as a reduction to selling and administrative expenses. The comparison of selling and administrative expenses also benefited from lower legal costs. These positive comparisons were offset in part by payroll and other administrative costs which were higher as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization\nOur depreciation and amortization expense was $81.6 million, or 5.6% of revenues, in fiscal 2016 compared to $77.1 million, or 5.3% of revenues, in fiscal 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense increased due to capital expenditure and acquisition activity in earlier periods.\nIncome from operations\nFor the year ended August 27, 2016, the changes in revenues in our Core Laundry Operations, Specialty Garments and First Aid segments, as well as the changes in our costs discussed above, resulted in the following changes in our income from operations:\n\nOther (income) expense\nOther (income) expense, which includes interest expense, interest income and foreign exchange loss, was income of $2.2 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to income of $0.9 million for fiscal 2015. The increase of $1.3 million was primarily due to foreign currency losses of $0.3 million in fiscal 2016 compared to foreign currency losses of $1.6 million during fiscal 2015.\nProvision for income taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 38.5% for fiscal 2016 compared to 38.2% for fiscal 2015. The increase in our effective tax rate was due to a change in the mix of our jurisdictional earnings.\nFiscal Year Ended August 29, 2015 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended August 30, 2014\nRevenues\n\nIn fiscal 2015, our consolidated revenues increased by $61.7 million from the comparable period in 2014, or 4.4%. The increase in our consolidated revenues was primarily driven by the growth in our Core Laundry Operations, with revenues increasing to $1.322 billion in fiscal 2015 from $1.259 billion in fiscal 2014, or 5.0%. Excluding the negative effect of a weaker Canadian dollar of 0.9%, as well as the positive effect of acquisitions of 0.7%, organic growth was 5.2%. Organic growth consists primarily of new sales, price increases, and net changes in the wearer levels at our existing customers, offset by lost accounts. Organic growth in fiscal 2015 benefited from new account sales and annual price adjustments. These benefits were partially offset by decreases in net wearer counts at our existing customers primarily due to reductions at customers that directly or indirectly support oil or other energy production, as well as higher lost accounts compared to a year ago.\nSpecialty Garments' revenue decreased from $91.5 million in fiscal 2014 to $87.5 million in fiscal 2015, or 4.3%. This decrease was the result of reduced power reactor business in North American compared to a year ago as well as the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar and euro. This segment's results are often affected by the timing and length of its customers' power reactor outages as well as its project-based activities. First Aid revenues increased 6.5%, from $43.9 million in fiscal 2014 to $46.8 million in fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily due to solid performance by this segment's wholesale distribution and pill packaging operations.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues decreased as a percentage of revenues from 61.5%, or $858.3 million, in fiscal 2014 to 60.7% of revenues, or $884.7 million, in fiscal 2015. This decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to lower fuel costs associated with our fleet of delivery vehicles, lower natural gas costs and lower payroll related costs in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year. These costs were offset by higher merchandise amortization costs as a percentage of revenues during fiscal 2015 as compared to the prior year.\nSelling and administrative expense\nOur selling and administrative expenses increased to 20.2% of revenues, or $294.4 million in fiscal 2015, from 19.5% of revenues, or $271.6 million in fiscal 2014. This increase was primarily due to higher legal expenses and reserves related to miscellaneous legal matters, as well as higher cost related to IT infrastructure investments. In fiscal 2015, we also recorded an additional $3.0 million in expense related to our environmental contingency reserves compared to the prior year. This increase was due to a number of factors, including additional costs we expect to incur associated with the construction of a planned municipal transit station in the area of our Somerville site as well as the impact of lower interest rates on the discounting of our environmental liabilities in the prior year.\nDepreciation and amortization\nOur depreciation and amortization expense was $77.1 million, or 5.3% of revenues, in fiscal 2015 compared to $71.8 million, or 5.1% of revenues, in fiscal 2014. Depreciation and amortization expense increased due to capital expenditure and acquisition activity in earlier periods.\nIncome from operations\nFor the year ended August 29, 2015, the changes in revenues in our Core Laundry Operations, Specialty Garments and First Aid segments, as well as the changes in our costs discussed above, resulted in the following changes in our income from operations:\n\nOther (income) expense\nOther (income) expense, which includes interest expense, interest income and foreign exchange loss, was income of $0.9 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to income of $2.1 million for fiscal 2014. The decrease of $1.2 million in other income was primarily the result of foreign currency losses of approximately $1.6 million during fiscal 2015 compared to foreign currency losses of approximately $0.3 million during fiscal 2014.\nProvision for income taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 38.2% for fiscal 2015 compared to 38.6% for fiscal 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in state income taxes as well as a change in the mix of jurisdictional earnings in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $363.8 million as of August 27, 2016, an increase of $87.2 million from $276.6 million as of August 29, 2015. Our working capital was $625.0 million as of August 27, 2016 compared to $477.7 million as of August 29, 2015. Subsequent to August 27, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Arrow Uniform for a cash purchase price of approximately $122.0 million. We generated $207.6 million and $226.9 million in cash from operating activities in the fiscal years ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, respectively. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balances, our cash generated from future operations and amounts available under our Credit Agreement (defined below) will be sufficient to meet our current anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nWe have accumulated $54.9 million in cash outside the United States that is expected to be invested indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were distributed to the U.S. in the form of dividends, we would likely be subject to additional U.S. income taxes. However, we do not believe that any resulting taxes payable would have a material impact on our liquidity.\nCash flows provided by operating activities have historically been the primary source of our liquidity. We generally use these cash flows to fund most, if not all, of our operations, capital expenditure and acquisition activities as well as dividends on our common stock. We may also use cash flows provided by operating activities, as well as proceeds from loans payable and long-term debt, to fund growth and acquisition opportunities, as well as other cash requirements.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended August 27, 2016 was $207.6 million, a decrease of $19.3 million from the prior fiscal year when cash provided by operating activities was $226.9 million. This net decrease was partially driven by the timing of income tax payments and the impact of changes in deferred income taxes. In addition, the comparison of cash provided by operating activities was impacted by a settlement related to environmental litigation the Company entered into in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 which resulted in a gain of $15.9 million booked as a reduction of selling and administrative expenses. A significant portion of the funds related to this settlement were received in September 2016 and, therefore, did not translate into operating cash flow during fiscal 2016.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended August 27, 2016 was $114.7 million, a decrease of 9.6 million from the prior fiscal year when cash used in investing activities was $124.3 million. The net decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by a decrease in cash outflows of $5.8 million for the acquisition of businesses as well as a decrease in cash outflow of $2.9 million for capital expenditures.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended August 27, 2016 was $5.6 million compared to cash used in financing activities of $6.3 million for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2015. This change was primarily due to a net decrease of cash outflows of $4.9 million related to proceeds and payments on loans payable and long-term debt in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. This decrease was offset in part by a decrease in proceeds received from the exercise of share based awards.\nLong-term debt and borrowing capacity\nOn April 11, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of banks, which matures on April 11, 2021. The Credit Agreement amended and restated our prior $250.0 million revolving credit agreement, which was scheduled to mature on May 4, 2016. Under the Credit Agreement, we are able to borrow funds at variable interest rates based on, at our election, the Eurodollar rate or a base rate, plus in each case a spread based on our consolidated funded debt ratio. Availability of credit requires compliance with certain financial and other covenants, including a maximum consolidated funded debt ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement. We test our compliance with these financial covenants on a fiscal quarterly basis. As of August 27, 2016, the interest rates applicable to our borrowings under the Credit Agreement would be calculated as LIBOR plus 75 basis points at the time of the respective borrowing. As of August 27, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings and had outstanding letters of credit amounting to $53.0 million, leaving $197.0 million available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement.\nAs of August 27, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nIn January 2015, we entered into sixteen forward contracts to exchange Canadian dollars ( CAD\u201d) for U.S. dollars at fixed exchange rates in order to manage our exposure related to certain forecasted CAD denominated sales of one of our subsidiaries. The hedged transactions are specified as the first amount of CAD denominated revenues invoiced by one of our domestic subsidiaries each fiscal quarter, beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 and continuing through the second fiscal quarter of 2019. In total, we will sell approximately 31.0 million CAD at an average Canadian-dollar exchange rate of 0.7825 over these quarterly periods. We concluded that the forward contracts met the criteria to qualify as a cash flow hedge under US GAAP. Accordingly, we have reflected all changes in the fair value of the forward contracts in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, a component of shareholders' equity. Upon the maturity of each foreign exchange forward contract, the gain or loss on the contract will be recorded as an adjustment to revenues.\nAs of August 27, 2016, we had forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 17.1 million CAD outstanding and recorded the fair value of the contracts of $0.1 million in other long-term assets and $0.1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets with a corresponding gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income of $0.1 million, which was recorded net of tax. During the fiscal year ended August 27, 2016, we reclassified $0.2 million from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to revenue, related to the derivative financial instruments. The gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as of August 27, 2016 is expected to be reclassified to revenues prior to its maturity on February 22, 2019.\nEnvironmental and Legal Contingencies\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other substances. In particular, industrial laundries currently use and must dispose of detergent waste water and other residues, and, in the past, used perchloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents. We are attentive to the environmental concerns surrounding the disposal of these materials and have, through the years, taken measures to avoid their improper disposal. Over the years, we have settled, or contributed to the settlement of, actions or claims brought against us relating to the disposal of hazardous materials and there can be no assurance that we will not have to expend material amounts to remediate the consequences of any such disposal in the future.\nUS GAAP requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. We regularly consult with attorneys and outside consultants in our consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances before recording a contingent liability. Changes in enacted laws, regulatory orders or decrees, our estimates of costs, risk-free interest rates, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, the timing of payments, the input of our attorneys and outside consultants or other factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for our environmental and other contingent liabilities.\nUnder environmental laws, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on, or in, or emanating from such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. There can be no assurances that acquired or leased locations have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon our Company under such laws or expose our Company to third party actions such as tort suits. We continue to address environmental conditions under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise with respect to sites located in or related to Woburn, Massachusetts, Somerville, Massachusetts, Springfield, Massachusetts, Uvalde, Texas, Stockton, California, three sites related to former operations in Williamstown, Vermont, as well as sites located in Goldsboro, North Carolina, Wilmington, North Carolina, Landover, Maryland and Syracuse, New York.\nWe have accrued certain costs related to the sites described above as it has been determined that the costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We have potential exposure related to a parcel of land (the Central Area\u201d) related to the Woburn, Massachusetts site mentioned above. Currently, the consent decree for the Woburn site does not define or require any remediation work in the Central Area. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA\u201d) has provided us and other signatories to the consent decree with comments on the design and implementation of groundwater and soil remedies at the Woburn site and investigation of environmental conditions in the Central Area. We, and other signatories, have implemented and proposed to do additional work at the Woburn site but many of the EPA's comments remain to be resolved. We have accrued costs to perform certain work responsive to EPA's comments. We have implemented mitigation measures and continue to monitor environmental conditions at the Somerville, Massachusetts site. In addition, we have received demands from the local transit authority for reimbursement of certain costs associated with its construction of a new municipal transit station in the area of our Somerville site. This station is part of a planned extension of the transit system. Due to cost projections of the extension which now substantially exceed original estimates, the local transit authority has placed the extension on hold pending its redesign and receipt of related state and federal approvals and funding increases. We have reserved for costs in connection with this matter; however, in light of the uncertainties associated with this matter, these costs and the related reserve may change. We have also received notice that the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection is conducting an audit of our investigation and remediation work with respect to the Somerville site.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company entered into a settlement related to environmental litigation which resulted in a $15.9 million gain that was recorded as a reduction of selling and administrative expenses. This gain consisted of amounts previously received but not recognized into income as well as amounts that the Company received in September 2016.\nWe routinely review and evaluate sites that may require remediation and monitoring and determine our estimated costs based on various estimates and assumptions. These estimates are developed using our internal sources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on:\n \u2022 Management's judgment and experience in remediating and monitoring our sites; \n \u2022 Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation and monitoring; \n \u2022 The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) who may be liable for remediation and monitoring of a specific site; and \n \u2022 The typical allocation of costs among PRPs. \nThere is usually a range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with each site. In accordance with US GAAP, our accruals represent the amount within the range that we believe is the best estimate or the low end of a range of estimates if no point within the range is a better estimate. When we believe that both the amount of a particular liability and the timing of the payments are reliably determinable, we adjust the cost in current dollars using a rate of 3% for inflation until the time of expected payment and discount the cost to present value using current risk-free interest rates. As of August 27, 2016, the risk-free interest rates we utilized ranged from 1.6% to 2.3%.\nFor environmental liabilities that have been discounted, we include interest accretion, based on the effective interest method, in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The changes to the amounts of our environmental liabilities for the years ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):\n\nAnticipated payments and insurance proceeds of currently identified environmental remediation liabilities as of August 27, 2016 for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, as measured in current dollars, are reflected below (in thousands).\n\nEstimated insurance proceeds are primarily received from an annuity received as part of our legal settlement with an insurance company. Annual proceeds of approximately $0.3 million are deposited into an escrow account which funds remediation and monitoring costs for three sites related to our former operations in Williamstown, Vermont. Annual proceeds received but not expended in the current year accumulate in this account and may be used in future years for costs related to this site through the year 2027. As of August 27, 2016, the balance in this escrow account, which is held in a trust and is not recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, was approximately $3.4 million. Also included in estimated insurance proceeds are amounts we are entitled to receive pursuant to legal settlements as reimbursements from three insurance companies for estimated costs at the site in Uvalde, Texas.\nOur nuclear garment decontamination facilities are licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC\u201d), or, in certain cases, by the applicable state agency, and are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. We also have nuclear garment decontamination facilities in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. These facilities are licensed and regulated by the respective country's applicable federal agency. There can be no assurance that such regulation will not lead to material disruptions in our garment decontamination business.\nFrom time to time, we are also subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of our business operations, including personal injury claims, customer contract matters, employment claims and environmental matters as described above.\nWhile it is impossible for us to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to contingent liabilities, including lawsuits and environmental contingencies, we believe that the aggregate amount of such liabilities, if any, in excess of amounts covered by insurance have been properly accrued in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. It is possible, however, that the future financial position and/or results of operations for any particular future period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or strategies related to these contingencies or changes out of our control.\nAcquisitions\nAs part of our business, we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other garment service companies. In recent years, we have typically paid for acquisitions with cash and may continue to do so in the future. To pay for an acquisition, we may use cash on hand, cash generated from operations or borrowings under our Credit Agreement, or we may pursue other forms of debt financing. Our ability to secure short-term and long-term debt financing in the future will depend on several factors, including our future profitability, our levels of debt and equity, and the overall credit and equity market environments.\nOn September 19, 2016, we completed an acquisition of Arrow Uniform ( Arrow\u201d) for approximately $122.0 million. The all-cash transaction is structured as an asset acquisition, with UniFirst acquiring substantially all of Arrow's assets and virtually none of its liabilities. Arrow, headquartered in Taylor, Michigan, provides uniform and facility service rental programs as well as direct sale uniform programs to a wide range of large and small customers. Arrow operates from 12 locations with nearly 700 employees in five Midwestern states.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments\nThe following information is presented as of August 27, 2016 (in thousands).\n\nWe have uncertain tax positions that are reserved totaling $3.7 million as of August 27, 2016 that are excluded from the above table as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority.\nWe have accrued $26.7 million in costs related to certain environmental obligations we have to address under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise. Refer to Environmental and Legal Contingencies\u201d, above for additional discussion on our environmental obligations.\nAs discussed above under Long-Term Debt and Borrowing Capacity\u201d, as of August 27, 2016, we had borrowing capacity of $250.0 million under our Credit Agreement, of which approximately $197.0 million was available for borrowing. Also, as of such date, we had no outstanding borrowings and letters of credit outstanding of $53.0 million. All letters of credit expire in less than one year. We expect to replace the Credit Agreement prior to its maturity with a new revolving line of credit on appropriate terms.\nIn January 2015, we entered into sixteen forward contracts to exchange Canadian dollars ( CAD\u201d) for U.S. dollars at fixed exchange rates in order to manage our exposure related to certain forecasted CAD denominated sales of one of our subsidiaries. The hedged transactions are specified as the first amount of CAD denominated revenues invoiced by one of our domestic subsidiaries each fiscal quarter, beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 and continuing through the second fiscal quarter of 2019. In total, we will sell approximately 31.0 million CAD at an average Canadian-dollar exchange rate of 0.7825 over these quarterly periods. We concluded that the forward contracts met the criteria to qualify as a cash flow hedge under US GAAP. Accordingly, we have reflected all changes in the fair value of the forward contracts in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, a component of shareholders' equity. Upon the maturity of each foreign exchange forward contract, the gain or loss on the contract will be recorded as an adjustment to revenues.\nAs of August 27, 2016, we had forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 17.1 million CAD outstanding and recorded the fair value of the contracts of $0.1 million in other long-term assets and $0.1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets with a corresponding gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income of $0.1 million, which was recorded net of tax. During the fiscal year ended August 27, 2016, we reclassified $0.2 million from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to revenue, related to the derivative financial instruments. The gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as of August 27, 2016 is expected to be reclassified to revenues prior to its maturity on February 22, 2019.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, our revenues and operating results have varied from quarter to quarter and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations have been due to a number of factors, including: general economic conditions in our markets; the timing of acquisitions and of commencing start-up operations and related costs; our effectiveness in integrating acquired businesses and start-up operations; the timing of nuclear plant outages; capital expenditures; seasonal rental and purchasing patterns of our customers; and price changes in response to competitive factors. In addition, our operating results historically have been lower during the second and fourth fiscal quarters than during the other quarters of the fiscal year. The operating results for any historical quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for an entire fiscal year or any other interim periods.\nEffects of Inflation\nIn general, we believe that our results of operations are not dependent on moderate changes in the inflation rate. Historically, we have been able to manage the impacts of more significant changes in inflation rates through our customer relationships, customer agreements that generally provide for price increases consistent with the rate of inflation, and continued focus on improvements of operational productivity.\nEnergy Costs\nSignificant increases in energy costs, specifically with respect to natural gas and gasoline, can materially affect our operating costs. During fiscal 2016, our energy costs, which include fuel, natural gas, and electricity, represented approximately 3.8% of our total revenue.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance for revenue recognition, which they have subsequently modified. This modified update provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods, and any interim periods within those annual periods, that begin after December 15, 2017 and will be required to be applied retrospectively, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard will be effective for us on August 26, 2018. We are currently evaluating the adoption method we will apply and the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance on consolidation requirements. This update changes the guidance with respect to the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard became effective for us on August 28, 2016. We expect that adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs. This update changes the guidance with respect to presenting such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard became effective for us on August 28, 2016. We expect that adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016, and is to be applied prospectively, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard will be effective for us on August 27, 2017. We expect that adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that require an entity to recognize adjustments made to provisional amounts that are identified in a business combination be recorded in the period such adjustments are determined, rather than retrospectively adjusting previously reported amounts. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, and is to be applied prospectively, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard became effective for us on August 28, 2016. We expect that adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance on the presentation of deferred income taxes. This update requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 and is to be applied prospectively, and may also be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this standard prospectively on February 27, 2016, and prior periods were not retroactively adjusted.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of certain financial assets and liabilities. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard will be effective for us on August 26, 2018. We expect that adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance that improves transparency and comparability among companies by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and by disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard will be effective for us on September 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance that simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 and, depending on the amendment, must be applied using a prospective transition method, retrospective transition method, modified retrospective transition method, prospectively and/or retroactively, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the standard will be effective for us on August 27, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.", "item_7_tables": "Table 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
