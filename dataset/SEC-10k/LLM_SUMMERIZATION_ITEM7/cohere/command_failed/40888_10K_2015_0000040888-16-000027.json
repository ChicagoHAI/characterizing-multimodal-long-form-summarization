Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nUnless otherwise indicated or required by the context, as used in this Form 10-K, the terms we,\u201d our\u201d and us\u201d refer to Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries that are consolidated in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d).\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Report, the risk factors appearing in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report, and the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements appearing at the beginning of Item 1. Business of this Report. Historical results set forth in Item 6.

Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Report should not be taken as indicative of our future operations.\nRestatement\nAs indicated in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K, we corrected errors in our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the Restated Periods primarily related to the following matters: (i) purchase accounting associated with contracts acquired as part of the acquisition of the Rocketdyne Business; (ii) contract accounting related to subsequent modifications to one significant acquired contract; (iii) contract accounting related to the improper recognition of sales associated with incentives; and (iv) other individually immaterial items. A summary of the impact to pretax income (loss) from continuing operations by reporting period is presented below (in millions):\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First nine months of fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase accounting for contracts acquired as part of the acquisition of the Rocketdyne Business (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract accounting related to subsequent modifications to one significant acquired Rocketdyne Business contract (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract accounting related to improper recognition of sales incentives (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other individually immaterial items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________\n(1) Our errors associated with purchase accounting primarily related to the following: (i) fair value assessment of Rocketdyne Business acquired customer contracts at the acquisition date following the close of the transaction. The Company failed to fair value three acquired contracts in purchase accounting; and (ii) the estimates of the Rocketdyne Business contracts' percentage of completion used to recognize net sales should have been based on its estimate of remaining effort on such contracts at the acquisition date instead of the inception date of the contract.\n(2) We did not appropriately account for one significant Rocketdyne Business contract amendment. Instead of being accounted for as a modification, the amendment was accounted for as a new contract.\n(3) We immediately recognized incentives as sales based on the full amount received rather than on the percentage of completion of the related contract.\nThe correction of the matters described above resulted in the following adjustments to the previously issued consolidated financial statements: (i) an increase of $0.3 million, or $0.00 loss per share, to net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2015; (ii) a decrease of $3.0 million, or $0.06 loss per share, to net loss for fiscal 2014; and (iii) a decrease of $5.0 million, or $0.06 diluted income per share, to net income for fiscal 2013.

We also have a real estate segment that includes activities related to the re-zoning, entitlement, sale, and leasing of our excess real estate assets. Our continuing operations are organized into two segments:\nAerospace and Defense - includes the operations of our wholly-owned subsidiary Aerojet Rocketdyne, a leading technology-based designer, developer and manufacturer of aerospace and defense products and systems for the U.S. government, including the DoD, NASA, major aerospace and defense prime contractors as well as portions of the commercial sector. Aerojet Rocketdyne is a world-recognized engineering and manufacturing company that specializes in the development and production of propulsion systems for defense and space applications, armament systems for precision tactical systems and munitions, and is considered a domestic market leader in launch propulsion, in-space propulsion, missile defense propulsion, tactical missile propulsion and hypersonic propulsion systems.\nReal Estate - includes the activities of our wholly-owned subsidiary Easton related to the re-zoning, entitlement, sale, and leasing of our excess real estate assets. We own approximately 11,500 acres of land adjacent to U.S. Highway 50 between Rancho Cordova and Folsom, California east of Sacramento. We are currently in the process of seeking zoning changes and other governmental approvals on a portion of the Sacramento Land to optimize its value. In addition, we are currently in the process of completing certain infrastructure improvements to the Sacramento Land to enhance its value.\nA summary of the significant financial highlights for fiscal 2015 which management uses to evaluate our operating performance and financial condition is presented below.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net sales for fiscal 2015 totaled $1,708.3 million compared to $1,602.2 million for fiscal 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net loss for fiscal 2015 was $(16.2) million, or $(0.27) loss per share, compared to net loss of $(50.0) million, or $(0.86) loss per share, for fiscal 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted EBITDAP (Non-GAAP measure*) for fiscal 2015 was $217.9 million, or 12.8% of net sales, compared to $181.5 million, or 11.3% of net sales, for fiscal 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Segment performance (Non-GAAP measure*) before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefit expense, and unusual items was $200.1 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $152.8 million for fiscal 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 totaled $65.1 million, compared to $150.6 million in fiscal 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Free cash flow (Non-GAAP measure*) in fiscal 2015 totaled $28.3 million, compared to $107.2 million in fiscal 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>As of November 30, 2015, we had $2.4 billion of total funded contract backlog compared to $2.2 billion as of November 30, 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>As of November 30, 2015, we had $4.1 billion of total contract backlog (total funded and unfunded backlog) compared to $3.1 billion as of November 30, 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>As of November 30, 2015, we had $440.9 million in net debt (Non-GAAP measure*) compared to $516.3 million as of November 30, 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> _________\n* We provide Non-GAAP measures as a supplement to financial results based on GAAP. A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is presented later in the Management's Discussion and Analysis under the heading Operating Segment Information\u201d and Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nOur fiscal year ends on November 30 of each year. The fiscal year of our subsidiary, Aerojet Rocketdyne, ends on the last Saturday of November. As a result of the 2013 calendar, Aerojet Rocketdyne had 14 weeks of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 13 weeks of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and 2014. The additional week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 accounted for $27.8 million in additional net sales.\nOn January 20, 2016, our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year-end from November 30 of each year to December 31 of each year.\nIn July 2012, we signed the Original Purchase Agreement with UTC to acquire the Rocketdyne Business from UTC for $550 million. On June 12, 2013, we entered into an Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement with UTC, which amended and restated the Original Purchase Agreement, as amended. On June 14, 2013, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the Rocketdyne Business pursuant to the Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement. The aggregate consideration to UTC was $411 million which represents the initial purchase price of $550 million reduced by $55 million relating to the potential future acquisition of UTC's 50% ownership interest of RD Amross (a joint venture with NPO Energomash of Khimki, Russia which sells RD-180 engines to RD Amross) and the portion of the UTC business that markets and supports the sale of RD-180 engines. The acquisition of UTC's 50% ownership interest of RD Amross and UTC's related business was contingent upon certain conditions including receipt of certain Russian governmental regulatory approvals, which was not obtained. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement, on June 14, 2015, our obligations to consummate the RDA Acquisition expired.\nThe unaudited pro forma information for fiscal 2013 set forth below gives effect to the Acquisition as if it had occurred at the beginning of the year. These amounts have been calculated after applying our accounting policies and adjusting the results of the Rocketdyne Business to reflect depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value\nadjustments to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets had been applied as at the beginning of the year, together with the tax effects, as applicable. The pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that actually would have been achieved had the Acquisition been consummated as of that time or that may result in the future.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions, except per share amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,378.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,757.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic income per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted income per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are operating in an environment that is characterized by both increasing complexity in the global security environment, as well as continuing worldwide economic pressures. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on delivering excellent performance to our customers, driving improvements and efficiencies across our operations, and creating value through the enhancement and expansion of our business.\nWe continuously evaluate a broad range of options that could be implemented to increase operational efficiency across all sites, and improve our overall market competitiveness. Our decisions will be focused on moving us forward to solidify our leadership in the propulsion markets.\nSome of the significant challenges we face are as follows: dependence upon U.S. government programs and contracts, future reductions or changes in U.S. government spending in our markets, implementation of our CIP, environmental matters, capital structure, and underfunded pension plan.\nMajor Customers\nThe principal end user customers of our products and technology are agencies of the U.S. government. Since a majority of our sales are, directly or indirectly, to the U.S. government, funding for the purchase of our products and services generally follows trends in U.S. aerospace and defense spending. However, individual U.S. government agencies, which include the military services, NASA, the Missile Defense Agency, and the prime contractors that serve these agencies, exercise independent purchasing power within budget top-line\u201d limits. Therefore, sales to the U.S. government are not regarded as sales to one customer, but rather each contracting agency is viewed as a separate customer.\nCustomers that represented more than 10% of net sales for the periods presented are as follows: Table 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lockheed Martin\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Raytheon\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ULA\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NASA\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Less than 10%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our sales to each of the major customers listed above involve several product lines and programs.\nSales to the U.S. government and its agencies, including sales to our significant customers discussed above, were as follows (dollars in millions): Table 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Government\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Net\nSales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,529.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>1,478.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2013\n</td> <td>1,305.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Standard Missile program, which is comprised of several contracts and is included in U.S. government sales, represented 14%, 12%, and 22% of net sales for fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. In addition, the THAAD program, which is comprised of several contracts and is included in U.S. government sales, represented 13%, 12%, and 3% of net sales for fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.\nIndustry Update\nOur primary aerospace and defense customers include the DoD and its agencies, NASA, and the prime contractors that supply products to these customers. We are seeing more opportunities for commercial launch and in-space business. In addition, sales to our aerospace and defense customers that provide products to international customers continue to grow. However, we continue to rely on particular levels of U.S. government spending on propulsion systems for defense, space and armament systems, precision tactical weapon systems and munitions applications, and our backlog depends, in large part, on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we are involved. These funding levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but rather follow the cycle of general public policy and political support for this type of funding. Moreover, although our contracts often contemplate that our services will be performed over a period of several years, the U.S. Congress must appropriate funds for a given program and the U.S. President must sign government budget legislation each GFY and may significantly increase, decrease or eliminate, funding for a program. A decrease in DoD and/or NASA expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a material program in which we are or hope to be involved, or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government outlays, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011 established statutory limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, or budgets caps, for both defense and non-defense over the next 10 years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 provided temporary relief to the Budget Control Act of 2011 cap levels in GFY 2014 and 2015 and eased sequestration spending cuts to the DoD and other federal agencies (e.g., NASA) for GFY 2014 and 2015, paving the way for eventual agreements on GFY 2014 and 2015 appropriations for all federal agencies. Similarly, in November 2015, the U.S. President signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, providing another two years of relief to the Budget Control Act cap numbers. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 covers both GFY 2016 and 2017 and allows for increased spending levels for DoD and other U.S. government agencies including NASA. This paved the way for the U.S. Congress to pass and the U.S. President to sign into law a $1.1 trillion Omnibus\u201d appropriations bill for GFY 2016, funding all government agencies. The defense portion of the bill provides $514.1\nbillion in base defense funding and $58.6 billion in overseas contingency operations. The base funding level is $12.8 billion below the GFY 2016 budget request while the overseas contingency operations portion is $7.7 billion above the GFY 2016 budget request. The NASA portion contains a top line of $19.3 billion, a $1.3 billion increase over GFY 2015 level.\nDespite overall U.S. government budget pressures, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from funding in DoD and NASA priority areas. This view reflects the DoD's strategic guidance report released in January 2012, and the 2014 QDR which affirms support for many of our core programs and explicitly states Missile Defense, Space, Nuclear Deterrence, and Precision Strike as key capabilities for the DoD to preserve.\nThe NASA Authorization Act has again identified the SLS program as one of its top priorities in the NASA GFY 2016 budget. The SLS program also has enjoyed wide, bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress. We maintain a strong relationship with NASA and our propulsion systems have been powering NASA launch vehicles and spacecraft since the inception of the U.S. space program. Our booster, upper stage and Orion vehicle propulsion systems are currently baselined on the new SLS vehicle and both upper stage and booster engines are in development for future SLS variants. Due to the retirement of the space shuttle fleet, U.S. astronauts are now dependent on Russian Soyuz flights for access to and from the ISS for the better part of this decade. NASA has been working to re-establish U.S. manned space capability as soon as possible through development of a new space taxi\u201d to ferry astronauts and cargo to the ISS. In 2014, Boeing's CST-100 Starliner capsule, powered by Aerojet Rocketdyne propulsion, was selected by NASA to transport astronauts to and from the ISS. As Boeing's teammate, Aerojet Rocketdyne will be providing the propulsion system for this new vehicle, thereby supplementing its work for NASA on the SLS designed for manned deep space exploration. In both instances, we have significant propulsion content and we look forward to supporting these generational programs for NASA.\nThe competitive dynamics of our multi-faceted marketplace vary by product sector and customer as we experience many of the same influences felt by the broader aerospace and defense industry. The large majority of products we manufacture are highly complex, technically sophisticated and extremely hazardous to build, demanding rigorous manufacturing procedures and highly specialized manufacturing equipment. While historically these factors, coupled with the high cost to establish the infrastructure required to meet these needs, posed substantial barriers to entry, modern design tools and manufacturing techniques (additive manufacturing) available to new entrants with the ability to self-fund start-up as well as development costs has led to increased competition in space related markets. To date, the competition has been limited to a few participants who tend to be narrowly focused on products that are sub-elements of our overall product portfolio. For example, entrepreneurs such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, who have been or are in the process of developing liquid fuel propulsion capabilities are primarily focused on the development of space propulsion systems for heavy lift launch vehicles and are not pursuing or participating in the missile defense or tactical propulsion business segments that make up a substantial portion of our overall business. These new entrepreneurs have signaled their intent to compete primarily on price and are therefore bringing pressure to bear on existing cost paradigms and manufacturing methodologies.\nCompetitive Improvement Program\nIn March 2015, we initiated the CIP comprised of activities and initiatives aimed at reducing costs in order for us to continue to compete successfully. The company-wide initiative is being undertaken after a comprehensive assessment of our product portfolio to underpin Aerojet Rocketdyne's technological and competitive leadership in our markets through continued research and development. The CIP is composed of three major components: (i) facilities optimization and footprint reduction; (ii) product affordability; and (iii) reduced administrative and overhead costs. Under the CIP, we expect an estimated 500 headcount reduction in our total employee population. We currently estimate that we will incur restructuring and related costs over the next four years totaling approximately $110 million. When fully implemented, we anticipate that the CIP will result in annual cost savings of approximately $145 million beginning in fiscal 2019. As a result of this effort, we will be better positioned to deliver our innovative, high quality and reliable products at a lower cost to our customers. The CIP costs will consist primarily of severance and other employee related costs totaling approximately $43 million, operating facility costs totaling approximately $27 million, and $40 million for other costs relating to product re-qualification, knowledge transfer and other CIP implementation costs. A summary of our CIP reserve activity in fiscal 2015 is shown below:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Severance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Retention\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>February 28, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Accrual established\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Payments\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 30, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe costs associated with the CIP will be a component of our U.S. government forward pricing rates, and therefore, will be recovered through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. In addition to the employee-related CIP\nobligations, we incurred non-cash accelerated depreciation expense of $0.8 million in fiscal 2015 associated with changes in the estimated useful life of long-lived assets impacted by the CIP.\nAs part of our ongoing effort to optimize business resources and achieve headcount reduction goals established through the CIP, we offered a Voluntary Reduction in Force (\"VRIF\") in July 2015 to our employees. In connection with the VRIF, we recorded a liability of $2.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, consisting of costs for severance, employee-related benefits and other associated expenses. These costs will be a component of our U.S. government forward pricing rates, and therefore, will be recovered through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government.\nSuccessful implementation of the CIP initiative will directly benefit our ability to win important, new development work thereby advancing our wide range of next generation propulsion solutions including our newest liquid booster engine, the AR1. Here we plan to supplement the benefits from the CIP by continuing to invest in significant company-funded research and development activities toward the successful development of this engine to meet current and future U.S. space launch needs.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur current and former business operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes. Our policy is to conduct our business with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment.

Interest on long-term financing is not a recoverable cost under our U.S. government contracts. As of November 30, 2015, we had $652.0 million of debt principal outstanding. The fair value of the debt outstanding at November 30, 2015 was $751.5 million.\nRetirement Benefits\nWe expect to make cash contributions of approximately $23 million to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan in fiscal 2016. We estimate that approximately 83% of our unfunded pension obligation as of November 30, 2015 is related to Aerojet Rocketdyne which will be recoverable through our U.S. government contracts.\nThe funded status of our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan may be adversely affected by the investment experience of the plan's assets, by any changes in U.S. law and by changes in the statutory interest rates used by tax-qualified pension plans in the U.S. to calculate funding requirements. Accordingly, if the performance of our plan's assets does not meet our assumptions, if there are changes to the IRS regulations or other applicable law or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our future contributions to our underfunded pension plans could be higher than we expect.\nAdditionally, the level of returns on retirement benefit assets, changes in interest rates, changes in legislation, and other factors affect our financial results. The timing of recognition of pension expense or income in our financial statements differs from the timing of the required pension funding under PPA or the amount of funding that can be recorded in our overhead rates\nthrough our U.S. government contracting business. Our earnings are positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our employee retirement benefit plans.\nResults of Operations\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td>

The increase in net sales was primarily due to the following: (i) an increase of $84.3 million in space advanced programs primarily driven by the RS-25 program which is currently engaged in a significant development and integration effort in support of the SLS development program and increased development work on the Orion program partially offset by the successful completion of current J-2X program; (ii) an increase of $80.3 million in missile defense and strategic systems programs primarily driven by the increased deliveries on the THAAD and Standard Missile programs; and (iii) sale of approximately 550 acres of our Sacramento Land for $42.0 million. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $109.7 million in space launch programs primarily associated with the RL10 and RS-68 programs as a result of the timing of deliveries and costs incurred on these multi-year contracts and lower sales related to the Antares AJ-26 program close-out (see discussion below).\n** Primary reason for change. The increase in net sales was primarily due to the net sales from the acquired Rocketdyne Business. The Rocketdyne Business generated sales of $681.9 million in fiscal 2014 compared to $311.8 million in fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2014 and 2013 results include 12 months and 51/2 months, respectively, of the acquired Rocketdyne Business. The increase in net sales also included increased deliveries on the AJ60, THAAD, and Orion programs totaling $71.9 million. The increase in net sales was partially offset by (i) a decrease in the various Standard Missile contracts primarily from the transitioning of the Standard Missile-3 Block IB contract from development activities to low-rate initial production, decreased development activities for the TDACS for the Standard Missile-3 Block IIA contract, and the cessation of deliveries on the\nStandard Missile-1 Regrain contract in fiscal 2014 as a result of contract completion; (ii) an additional week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 resulting in $27.8 million in net sales; (iii) lower sales a result of the completion of the T3 IIA and IIB contracts as the program entered the next development phase; and (iv) decreased deliveries and changes in the estimated measurement of progress toward completion on the Antares program.\nCost of Sales (exclusive of items shown separately below):\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change**\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions, except percentage amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales:\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,459.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,406.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,406.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,234.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales\n</td> <td>85.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales excluding retirement benefit expense and step-up in fair value of inventory\n</td> <td>82.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of cost of sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales excluding retirement benefit expense and step-up in fair value of inventory\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,409.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,377.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,377.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,187.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales associated with the Acquisition step-up in fair value of inventory not allocable to our U.S. government contracts\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retirement benefit expense\n</td> <td>50.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,459.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,406.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,406.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,234.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Primary reason for change. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales excluding retirement benefit expense and the step-up in fair value of inventory is primarily due to (i) land sale of approximately 550 acres of Sacramento Land resulting in gross profit of $30.6 million, 1.8% of net sales, and (ii) the close-out of the Antares AJ-26 program. Aerojet Rocketdyne entered into a Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement (the Agreement\u201d) with Orbital Sciences Corporation ( Orbital\u201d) pursuant to which the parties mutually agreed to a termination for convenience of the contract relating to the provision by Aerojet Rocketdyne of 20 AJ-26 liquid propulsion rocket engines to Orbital for the Antares program (the Contract\u201d). The Agreement also settles all claims the parties may have had against one another arising out of the Contract and the launch failure that occurred on October 28, 2014 of an Antares launch vehicle carrying the Cygnus ORB-3 service and cargo module.

The decrease in other expense, net was primarily due to a decrease of $9.8 million in unusual items charges (see discussion of unusual items below).

The increase in interest expense was partially offset by the 4 1/16% Debentures repurchased during fiscal 2014.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit): Table 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision (benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(198.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the reconciling items between the income tax (benefit) provision using the federal statutory rate and our reported income tax provision (benefit).\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statutory U.S. federal income tax rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State and local income taxes, net of U.S. federal income tax effect\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in state income tax rates\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve adjustments\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Valuation allowance adjustments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(178.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rescindable common stock interest and realized losses (gains)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-deductible convertible subordinated notes interest\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-deductible premiums on repurchase of convertible subordinated notes\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research credits\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retroactive change in federal tax law\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit of manufacturing deductions\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lobbying costs\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision (benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(198.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn fiscal 2015, our effective tax rate was an income tax expense of 1.8% on a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $16.8 million. Our effective tax rate differed from the 35.0% statutory federal income tax rate due largely to state income taxes and certain non-deductible interest expense partially offset by the retroactive reinstatement of the federal R&D credit and the benefit related to manufacturing deductions.\nIn fiscal 2014, our effective tax rate was an income tax expense of 49.4% on a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $33.0 million. Our effective tax rate differed from the 35% statutory federal income tax rate due largely to the non-deductible premiums paid upon the redemption of portions of the convertible debt, state income taxes, impacts from the final research and development credit study, the benefit related to manufacturing deductions, and certain non-deductible interest expense.\nIn fiscal 2013, our effective tax rate was an income tax benefit of 555.7% on a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $35.7 million. Our effective tax rate differed from the 35% statutory federal income tax rate due largely to the release of a significant portion of the valuation allowance previously recorded against deferred tax assets, the impact of state income taxes, and certain non-deductible interest expense. We released $282.4 million of the valuation allowance that existed at the beginning of the year, of which approximately $178.7 million was recorded as an income tax benefit to continuing operations, $1.1 million to discontinued operations, and $102.6 million was recorded in other comprehensive income.\nThe carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. We need $473.6 million in pre-tax income and $409.9 million in other comprehensive income to realize the net deferred tax assets as of November 30, 2015. We project that future taxable income will increase as a result of increased income from continuing operations resulting from improved contract profit margins related to the Rocketdyne acquisition integration and improved margins beginning in fiscal 2015 due to anticipated contributions to our tax qualified defined benefit pension plan, which are recoverable through our U.S. government contracts. These increases in income from continuing operations will be partially offset by book to tax adjustments, primarily related to retirement benefit plan payments, state tax deductions, and our manufacturing deductions.\nThe timing of recording or releasing a valuation allowance requires significant management judgment. The amount of the valuation allowance released by us represents a portion of deferred tax assets that was deemed more-likely-than-not that we will realize the benefits based on the analysis in which the positive evidence outweighed the negative evidence.\nA valuation allowance is required when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized. Establishment and removal of a valuation allowance requires management to consider all positive and negative evidence and make a judgmental decision regarding the amount of valuation allowance required as of a reporting date. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. In the evaluation as of November 30, 2015 and 2014, management has considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to the following:\nPositive evidence\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The three year comprehensive cumulative income position as of November 30, 2015;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our recent history of generating taxable income which has allowed for the utilization of tax credit carryforwards, and the expected taxable income position for the current year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Pension rules that allow us to recover pension funding cash contributions through our U.S. government contracts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continuing positive results of operations from the acquisition of the Rocketdyne Business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Establishment and execution of the Competitive Improvement Program evidencing increasing growth and profitability;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increase in our contract backlog; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Favorable trends with respect to the market value of certain real estate assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Negative evidence\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our exposure to environmental remediation obligations and the related uncertainty as to the ultimate exposure upon settlement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The significance of our defined benefit pension obligation and related impact it could have in future years;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The additional indebtedness incurred in fiscal 2013 related to the acquisition of the Rocketdyne Business that continues to generate interest expense; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Potential three-year cumulative loss position at the end of fiscal 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> During fiscal 2015 and 2014, we continued to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance and have concluded in each quarter, including year end, that the amount of valuation allowance currently recorded was appropriate. We will continue to evaluate the ability to realize our net deferred tax assets to determine if an increase to our valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nThe Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 passed in December 2015, retroactively reinstating the federal R&D credit and \"bonus\" depreciation. As a result, we expect to record an estimated benefit to our income tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 of approximately $2.7 million related to the R&D credit. The impact of the additional tax depreciation will reduce our income taxes payable and long-term deferred tax assets by approximately $3 million.\nRetirement Benefit Plans:\nComponents of retirement benefit expense are: Table 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service cost\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest cost on benefit obligation\n</td> <td>65.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumed return on plan assets\n</td> <td>(88.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(96.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of prior service credits\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of net losses\n</td> <td>80.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in retirement benefit expense in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to higher actuarial losses arising from the November 30, 2014 measurement associated with the updated mortality assumption and a decrease in the discount rate used to determine our retirement benefit plans' obligations at November 30, 2014. The discount rate was 3.96% as of November 30, 2014 compared to 4.54% as of November 30, 2013.\nWe estimate that our non-cash retirement benefit expense will be approximately $67 million in fiscal 2016.\nMarket conditions and interest rates significantly affect the assets and liabilities of our pension plans. Pension accounting permits market gains and losses to be deferred and recognized over a period of years. This smoothing\u201d results in the creation of other accumulated income or losses which will be amortized to retirement benefit expense or benefit in future years. The accounting method we utilize recognizes one-fifth of the unamortized gains and losses associated with the market-related value of pension assets and all other gains and losses, including changes in the discount rate used to calculate benefit costs each year. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return and the actual return on the market-related value of assets which smoothes market related asset values over three years. Although the smoothing period mitigates some volatility in the calculation of annual retirement benefit expense, future expenses are impacted by changes in the market value of pension plan assets and changes in interest rates.\nAdditionally, we sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan and participation in the plan is available to substantially all employees. Our contributions to the 401(k) plan were $24.9 million in fiscal 2015, $24.4 million in fiscal 2014, and $14.7 million in fiscal 2013. The cost is recoverable through our overhead rates on our U.S. government contracts.\nOperating Segment Information:\nWe evaluate our operating segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment performance. Segment performance, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, represents net sales from continuing operations less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for unusual items relating to the segment. Excluded from segment performance are: corporate income and expenses, interest expense, interest income, income taxes, legacy income or expenses, and unusual items not related to the segment. We believe that segment performance provides information useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance. In addition, we provide the Non-GAAP financial measure of our operational performance called segment performance before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefit expense, Rocketdyne purchase accounting adjustments, and unusual items. We believe the exclusion of the items listed above permits an evaluation and a comparison of results for ongoing business operations, and it is on this basis that management internally assesses operational performance.\nAerospace and Defense Segment\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The increase in net sales was primarily due to the following: (i) an increase of $84.3 million in space advanced programs primarily driven by the RS-25 program which is currently engaged in a significant development and integration effort in support of the SLS development program and increased development work on the Orion program partially offset by the successful completion of current J-2X program and (ii) an increase of $80.3 million in missile defense and strategic systems programs primarily driven by the increased deliveries on the THAAD and Standard Missile programs. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $109.7 million in space launch programs primarily associated with the RL10 and RS-68 programs as a result of the timing of deliveries and costs incurred on these multi-year contracts and lower sales related to the Antares AJ-26 program close-out (see discussion below).\nThe increase in the segment margin before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefit plan expense, Rocketdyne purchase accounting adjustments, and unusual items in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the close-out of the Antares AJ-26 program (see discussion of Cost of Sales\u201d above) and costs associated with the AR1 program. During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we began separately reporting the portion of the engine development\nexpenses associated with our newest liquid booster engine, the AR1, which are currently not allocated across all contracts and programs in progress under U.S. governmental contractual arrangements (see additional discussion in Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements).

Fiscal 2014 and 2013 results include 12 months and 51/2 months, respectively, of the acquired Rocketdyne Business.

The increase in net sales was partially offset by (i) a decrease in the various Standard Missile contracts primarily from the transitioning of the Standard Missile-3 Block IB contract from development activities to low-rate initial production, decreased development activities for the TDACS for the Standard Missile-3 Block IIA contract, and the cessation of deliveries on the Standard Missile-1 Regrain contract in fiscal 2014 as a result of contract completion; (ii) an additional week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 resulting in $27.8 million in net sales; (iii) lower sales a result of the completion of the T3 IIA and IIB contracts as the program entered the next development phase; and (iv) decreased deliveries and changes in the estimated measurement of progress toward completion on the Antares program.\nThe decrease in the segment margin before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefit expense, Rocketdyne purchase accounting adjustments, and unusual items in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, was primarily due to $23.6 million, 1.5% of net sales, of cost growth on the Antares AJ-26 program, including the cost to repair or replace engines as necessary in light of the previously reported engine test failures, an associated increase in hardware inspections and corrective actions on remaining engines, costs to repair the damaged test stand, and costs resulting from delayed deliveries.\nA summary of our backlog is as follows:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>November 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 30, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In billions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funded backlog\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unfunded backlog\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contract backlog\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal backlog includes both funded backlog (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated).

During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we finalized the sale of the Hillsborough land for a total purchase price of $57.0 million which was comprised of $46.7 million cash and $10.3 million of promissory notes. The total acreage covered by the Hillsborough land transaction was approximately 700 acres, of which approximately 550 acres was recognized as a sale in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. At the initial closing, the buyer paid $40.0 million cash and executed a $9.0 million promissory note secured by a first lien Deed of Trust on a portion of the sale property which resulted in a gain of $30.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. The $9.0 million promissory note secured by a first lien Deed of Trust is divided into two components: (i) a $3.0 million 7% promissory note payable 7 years after close of escrow, which includes a possible $1.0 million reduction in principal if we are unable to obtain the necessary road and utility approvals, and (ii) a $6.0 million 7% promissory note payable 7 years after close of escrow and only payable after certain environmental clearances associated with \"Area 40\" (discussed below) are obtained by us. The sale also included a $1.3 million non-interest bearing promissory note secured by a first lien Deed of Trust on a portion of the sale property associated with the location of future city roads. In addition, approximately 150 acres of this land, including a 50-acre portion known as Area 40,\u201d was held back from the initial closing. Upon receipt of regulatory approvals, a closing will take place for the sale of the developable portions of such holdback acreage for a purchase price of $6.7 million in cash.\n** Primary reason for change. Net sales and segment performance consist primarily of rental property operations, and were essentially unchanged for the periods presented.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to segment performance (discussed above), we provide the Non-GAAP financial measure of our operational performance called Adjusted EBITDAP. We use this metric to further our understanding of the historical and prospective consolidated core operating performance of our segments, net of expenses resulting from our corporate activities in the ordinary, on-going and customary course of our operations. Further, we believe that to effectively compare the core operating performance metric from period to period on a historical and prospective basis, the metric should exclude items relating to retirement benefits (pension and postretirement benefits), significant non-cash expenses, the impacts of financing decisions on earnings, and items incurred outside the ordinary, on-going and customary course of our operations. Accordingly, we define Adjusted EBITDAP as GAAP loss from continuing operations before income taxes adjusted by interest expense, interest income, depreciation and amortization, retirement benefit expense, and unusual items which we do not believe are reflective of such ordinary, on-going and customary course activities. Adjusted EBITDAP does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net (loss) income, as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(33.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>50.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>65.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retirement benefit expense\n</td> <td>67.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unusual items\n</td> <td>51.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDAP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>217.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDAP as a percentage of net sales\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to segment performance and Adjusted EBITDAP, we provide the Non-GAAP financial measures of free cash flow and net debt.

We devote a significant amount of resources and management attention to environmental matters and actively manage our ongoing processes to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We are involved in the remediation of environmental conditions that resulted from generally accepted manufacturing and disposal practices at certain plants in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, we have been designated a PRP with other companies at third party sites undergoing investigation and remediation.\nEstimating environmental remediation costs is difficult due to the significant uncertainties inherent in these activities, including the extent of remediation required, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, evolving technologies and the long period of time over which most remediation efforts take place. We:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>accrue for costs associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and when our proportionate share of the costs can be reasonably estimated; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>record related estimated recoveries when such recoveries are deemed probable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition to the costs associated with environmental remediation discussed above, we incur expenditures for recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances or pollutants in ongoing operations which totaled $5.5 million in fiscal 2015, $7.1 million in fiscal 2014, and $4.9 million in fiscal 2013.\nA summary of our recoverable amounts, environmental reserves, and range of liability, as of November 30, 2015 is presented below: Table 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Recoverable\nAmount (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Reserve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Range\nof Liability\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerojet Rocketdyne - Sacramento\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$153.0 - $253.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerojet Rocketdyne - BPOU\n</td> <td>108.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140.1 - 183.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Aerojet Rocketdyne sites\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8 - 13.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other sites\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2 - 6.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>234.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>306.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$306.1 - $457.4\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Excludes the receivable from Northrop of $68.7 million as of November 30, 2015 related to environmental costs already paid (and therefore not reserved) by the Company in prior years and reimbursable under the Northrop Agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReserves\nWe review on a quarterly basis estimated future remediation costs and have an established practice of estimating environmental remediation costs over a fifteen year period, except for those environmental remediation costs with a specific contractual term. Environmental liabilities at the BPOU site are currently estimated through the anticipated term of the new Project Agreement. There can be no assurance that the term of a new Project Agreement will not be longer than the term we estimated and, if so, we may be required to make an additional accrual to reflect the longer term. As the period for which estimated environmental remediation costs lengthens, the reliability of such estimates decreases. These estimates consider the investigative work and analysis of engineers, outside environmental consultants, and the advice of legal staff regarding the status and anticipated results of various administrative and legal proceedings. In most cases, only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated. In establishing our reserves, the most probable estimate is used when determinable; otherwise, the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Accordingly, such estimates can change as we periodically evaluate and revise these estimates as new information becomes available. We cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will affect the estimated liability accrued. The timing of payment for estimated future environmental costs is influenced by a number of factors such as the regulatory approval process, and the time required for designing, constructing, and implementing the remedy.\nA summary of our environmental reserve activity is shown below:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Aerojet\nRocketdyne-\nSacramento\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Aerojet\nRocketdyne-\nBPOU\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\nAerojet\nRocketdyne\nSites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nAerojet\nRocketdyne\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nEnvironmental\nReserve\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 30, 2012\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenditures\n</td> <td>(22.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 30, 2013\n</td> <td>128.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions\n</td> <td>24.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenditures\n</td> <td>(21.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 30, 2014\n</td> <td>130.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions\n</td> <td>44.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenditures\n</td> <td>(21.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 30, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>306.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $176.6 million of environmental reserve additions in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the following items: (i) $126.3 million associated with our detailed review estimate related to the BPOU site to reflect the anticipated costs through the term of a new Project Agreement, and the amount reserved is based on the proposal by Aerojet Rocketdyne; (ii) $13.8 million associated with water replacement; (iii) $13.5 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (iv) $5.2 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; and (v) $17.8 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nThe $33.7 million of environmental reserve additions in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the following items: (i) $8.1 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $5.8 million associated with annual detailed review estimate updates; (iii) $4.0 million associated with water replacement; (iv) $3.0 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (v) $1.5 million of costs related to the Camden, Arkansas site; and (vi) $11.3 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nThe $18.8 million of environmental reserve additions in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the following items: (i) $6.6 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $4.4 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (iii) $2.3 million of additional estimated costs related to the former Toledo, Ohio site; (iv) $1.5 million associated with water replacement; and (v) $4.0 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nThe effect of the final resolution of environmental matters and our obligations for environmental remediation and compliance cannot be predicted with complete certainty due to changes in both the amount and timing of future expenditures as well as regulatory or technological changes. We believe, on the basis of presently available information, that the resolution of environmental matters and our obligations for environmental remediation and compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and/or financial condition. We will continue our efforts to mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of claims for recoveries from insurance coverage and other PRPs and continued investigation of new and more cost effective remediation alternatives and associated technologies.\nAs part of the acquisition of the Atlantic Research Corporation ( ARC\u201d) propulsion business in 2003, Aerojet Rocketdyne entered into an agreement with ARC pursuant to which Aerojet Rocketdyne is responsible for up to $20.0 million of costs ( Pre-Close Environmental Costs\u201d) associated with environmental issues that arose prior to Aerojet Rocketdyne's acquisition of the ARC propulsion business. ARC is responsible for any cleanup costs relating to the ARC acquired businesses in excess of $20.0 million. Pursuant to a separate agreement with the U.S. government which was entered into prior to the completion of the ARC acquisition, these costs are recovered through the establishment of prices for Aerojet Rocketdyne's products and services sold to the U.S. government. A summary of the Pre-Close Environmental Costs is shown below (in millions):\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-Close Environmental Costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amount spent through November 30, 2015\n</td> <td>(18.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amount included as a component of reserves for environmental remediation costs in the consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2015\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining Pre-Close Environmental Costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEstimated Recoveries\nOn January 12, 1999, Aerojet Rocketdyne and the U.S. government implemented the Global Settlement resolving certain prior environmental and facility disagreements, with retroactive effect to December 1, 1998. Under the Global Settlement, Aerojet Rocketdyne and the U.S. government resolved disagreements about an appropriate cost-sharing ratio with respect to the cleanup costs of the environmental contamination at the Sacramento and Azusa sites. The Global Settlement cost-sharing ratio does not have a defined term over which costs will be recovered. Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of the EIS business in 2001, Aerojet Rocketdyne entered into the Northrop Agreement whereby Aerojet Rocketdyne is reimbursed by Northrop for a portion of environmental expenditures eligible for recovery under the Global Settlement, subject to an annual and a cumulative limitation.\nMost of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these future costs are allowable to be included in our contracts with the U.S. government and allocable to Northrop until the cumulative expenditure limitation is reached. We currently estimate approximately 24% of our Aerospace and Defense segment environmental costs will not likely be reimbursable and are expensed to the consolidated statements of operations.\nAllowable environmental costs are charged to our contracts as the costs are incurred. Because these costs are recovered through forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet Rocketdyne to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on Aerojet Rocketdyne's sustained business volume under U.S. government contracts and programs.\nPursuant to the Northrop Agreement, environmental expenditures to be reimbursed are subject to annual limitations and the total reimbursements are limited to a ceiling of $189.7 million.

(ii) $10.5 million associated with water replacement; (iii) $10.2 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (iv) $3.9 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; and (v) $13.4 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nFiscal 2015 reimbursements -The $31.2 million of environmental expenditures that were reimbursed related to the following items: (i) $13.8 million for operations and maintenance of treatment facilities; (ii) $6.8 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (iii) $3.4 million associated with water supply replacement; (iv) $2.8 million associated with test sampling and analysis; (v) $1.1 million of costs related to the Camden, Arkansas site; and (vi) $3.3 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nFiscal 2015 other adjustments - The $25.4 million of other adjustments primarily relates to the impact of the Advance Agreement with the U.S. government revising the percent of environmental costs allocable to Northrop and the U.S. government. We currently estimate approximately 24% of our Aerospace and Defense segment environmental costs will not likely be reimbursable and are expensed to the consolidated statements of operations.\nFiscal 2014 Activity\nFiscal 2014 additions - The $21.4 million of additions to the environmental recoverable asset was primarily due to the following items: (i) $5.1 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $3.7 million associated with annual detailed review estimate updates; (iii) $2.5 million associated with water replacement; (iv) $1.9 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (v) $1.5 million of additional estimated costs related to the Camden, Arkansas site; and (vi) $6.7 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nFiscal 2014 reimbursements -The $31.0 million of environmental expenditures that were reimbursed related to the following items: (i) $12.6 million for operations and maintenance of treatment facilities; (ii) $8.1 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (iii) $2.7 million associated with test sampling and analysis; (iv) $1.7 million of additional estimated costs related to the Camden, Arkansas site; (v) $1.3 million associated with water supply replacement; and (vi) $4.6 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nFiscal 2013 Activity\nFiscal 2013 additions - The $8.7 million of additions to the environmental recoverable asset was primarily due to the following items: (i) $3.9 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $2.6 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (iii) $0.9 million associated with water replacement; and (iv) $1.3 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nFiscal 2013 reimbursements - The $30.5 million of environmental expenditures that were reimbursed related to the following items: (i) $11.5 million for operations and maintenance of treatment facilities; (ii) $9.3 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (iii) $2.1 million associated with water supply replacement; (iv) $1.6 million of additional estimated costs related to the Camden, Arkansas site; and (v) $6.0 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nEnvironmental reserves and recoveries impact to the consolidated statements of operations\nThe expenses associated with adjustments to the environmental reserves are recorded as a component of other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

In addition, we generated $69.6 million from working capital (defined as accounts receivables, inventories, other current assets, accounts payable, contract advances, real estate activities, and other current liabilities). The cash generated from working capital was primarily due to an\nincrease of $96.9 million in cash advances on long-term contracts. This amount was partially offset by the cash used for the Rocketdyne Business integration activities. In addition, we paid $4.9 million for income taxes, net in fiscal 2014.\nThe $77.4 million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013 was primarily the result of loss from continuing operations before income taxes adjusted for non-cash items which generated $96.0 million. This amount was partially offset by cash used to fund working capital (excluding the impact of changes in current deferred income taxes) including our real estate activities. The funding of working capital is primarily due to the following (i) a decrease in contract advances due to the timing of customer payments and (ii) an increase in accounts receivables due to timing of sales and billing during the quarter. These factors were partially offset by (i) an increase in accounts payable related to the increase in cost-reimbursable contract sales and timing of payments and (ii) an increase in other current liabilities primarily related to the timing of payments.\nNet Cash Used In Investing Activities\nDuring fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had capital expenditures of $36.8 million, $43.4 million and $63.2 million, respectively. During fiscal 2014 and 2013, capital expenditures total included $11.3 million and $25.4 million, respectively, related to consolidating the Rocketdyne Business facilities. Additionally, during fiscal 2013 the capital expenditures total included $16.4 million related to our ERP implementation.\nDuring fiscal 2014, we received $0.2 million for a purchase price adjustment for the Rocketdyne Business and we generated proceeds of $7.5 million from the sale of non-core technology. During fiscal 2013, we purchased the Rocketdyne Business for $411.2 million (see Note 5 in notes to consolidated financial statements.)\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nDuring fiscal 2015, we had $81.2 million in debt cash payments (see below). During fiscal 2014, we repurchased 3.5 million of our common shares at a cost of $64.5 million. We also issued $189.0 million of debt and had $166.3 million in debt cash payments (see below). In addition, we incurred $4.2 million of debt issuance costs. During fiscal 2013, we issued $460.0 million of debt and had $12.8 million in cash payments of debt. In addition, we incurred $14.9 million of debt issuance costs.\nDebt Activity and Covenants\nOur debt activity during fiscal 2015 was as follows:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>November 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cash\nPayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-cash\nActivity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 30, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7 1/8% Notes\n</td> <td>460.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>460.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4 1/16% Debentures\n</td> <td>133.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delayed draw term loan\n</td> <td>89.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other debt\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Debt and Borrowing Activity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>782.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(81.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(49.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>652.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are subject to certain limitations including the ability to incur additional debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, and make certain restricted payments, including stock repurchases and dividends. The Senior Credit Facility includes events of default usual and customary for facilities of this nature, the occurrence of which could lead to an acceleration of our obligations thereunder. Additionally, the Senior Credit Facility includes certain financial covenants, including that we maintain (i) a maximum total leverage ratio, calculated net of cash up to a maximum of $150.0 million, of 4.50 to 1.00 through the fiscal period ended November 30, 2015, 4.25 to 1.00 through fiscal periods ending November 30, 2017, and 4.00 to 1.00 thereafter; and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.40 to 1.00.\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Covenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Actual Ratios as of\nNovember 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Required Ratios\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest coverage ratio, as defined under the Senior Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.77 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Not less than: 2.40 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leverage ratio, as defined under the Senior Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.21 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Not greater than: 4.50 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe were in compliance with our financial and non-financial covenants as of November 30, 2015.\nOutlook\nShort-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of recurring operating expenses, including but not limited to costs related to our capital and environmental expenditures, company-funded research and development expenditures, debt service requirements, and retirement benefit plans. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and availability under our\nrevolving credit facility will provide sufficient funds to meet our operating plan, which includes our CIP and AR1 engine development costs, for the next twelve months. The operating plan for this period provides for full operation of our businesses, and interest and principal payments on our debt. As of November 30, 2015, we had $155.9 million of available borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. Based on our existing debt agreements, we were in compliance with our financial and non-financial covenants as of November 30, 2015. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the Senior Credit Facility, the Subordinated Credit Facility, the 7 1/8% Notes, and the 4 1/16% Debentures. In addition, our failure to pay principal and interest when due is a default under the Senior Credit Facility, and in certain cases, would cause cross defaults on the Subordinated Credit Facility, 7 1/8% Notes and 4 1/16% Debentures.\nWe are committed to a cash management strategy that maintains liquidity to adequately support the operation of the business, our growth strategy and to withstand unanticipated business volatility. We believe that cash generated from operations, together with our current levels of cash and investments as well as availability under our revolving credit facility, should be sufficient to maintain our ongoing operations, support working capital requirements, fund the CIP, make required cash contributions of approximately $23 million in fiscal 2016 to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, and fund anticipated capital expenditures related to projected business growth. Our cash management strategy includes maintaining the flexibility to pay down debt and/or repurchase shares depending on economic and other conditions. In connection with the implementation of our cash management strategy, our management may seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise if we believe that it is in our best interests. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nPotential future acquisitions depend, in part, on the availability of financial resources at an acceptable cost of capital. We expect to utilize cash on hand and cash generated by operations, as well as cash available under our Senior Credit Facility, which may involve renegotiation of credit limits to finance future acquisitions. Other sources of capital could include the issuance of common and/or preferred stock, and the placement of debt. We periodically evaluate capital markets and may access such markets when circumstances appear favorable. We believe that sufficient capital resources will be available from one or several of these sources to finance future acquisitions. However, no assurances can be made that acceptable financing will be available, or that acceptable acquisition candidates will be identified, or that any such acquisitions will be accretive to earnings.\nAs disclosed in Notes 9(b) and 9(c) of the notes to consolidated financial statements, we have exposure for certain legal and environmental matters. We believe that it is currently not possible to estimate the impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of certain of these matters will have on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nMajor factors that could adversely impact our forecasted operating cash flows and our financial condition are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition, our liquidity and financial condition will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates on the portion of debt that bears interest at variable interest rates.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of debt obligations, operating leases, certain other liabilities, and purchase commitments.

Due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid.\nWe may be required to make significant cash contributions in the future to fund our defined benefit pension plan, a portion of which we may not be able to immediately recover from our U.S. government contracts. In fiscal 2016, we expect to make cash contributions of approximately $23 million to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan.\nWe also issue purchase orders and make other commitments to suppliers for equipment, materials, and supplies in the normal course of business. These purchase commitments are generally for volumes consistent with anticipated requirements to fulfill purchase orders or contracts for product deliveries received, or expected to be received, from customers and would be subject to reimbursement if a cost-plus contract was terminated.\nArrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk\nAs of November 30, 2015, arrangements with off-balance sheet risk consisted of:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$44.1 million in outstanding commercial letters of credit expiring through April 2016, the majority of which may be renewed, primarily to collateralize obligations for environmental remediation and insurance coverage.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$45.5 million in outstanding surety bonds to primarily satisfy indemnification obligations for environmental remediation coverage.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Up to $120.0 million aggregate in guarantees by us of Aerojet Rocketdyne's obligations to U.S. government agencies for environmental remediation activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Guarantees, jointly and severally, by our material domestic subsidiaries of their obligations under our Senior Credit Facility and 7 1/8% Notes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition to the items discussed above, we have and will from time to time enter into certain types of contracts that require us to indemnify parties against potential third-party and other claims. These contracts primarily relate to: (i) divestiture agreements, under which we may provide customary indemnification to purchasers of our businesses or assets including, for\nexample, claims arising from the operation of the businesses prior to disposition, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination existing prior to disposition; (ii) certain real estate leases, under which we may be required to indemnify property owners for claims arising from the use of the applicable premises; and (iii) certain agreements with officers and directors, under which we may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their relationship with us. The terms of such obligations vary. Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated.\nWe provide product warranties in conjunction with certain product sales. The majority of our warranties are one-year standard warranties for parts, workmanship, and compliance with specifications. On occasion, we have made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation. While we have contracts with warranty provisions, there is not a history of any significant warranty claims experience. A reserve for warranty exposure is made on a product by product basis when it is both estimable and probable. These costs are included in the program's estimate at completion and are expensed in accordance with our revenue recognition methodology as allowed under GAAP for that particular contract.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP that offer acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain items affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets, and recognizing revenues.\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments, and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Management discusses those areas that require significant judgment with the audit committee of our board of directors. All of our financial disclosures in our filings with the SEC have been reviewed with the audit committee. Although we believe that the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively and, if significant, disclosed in notes of the consolidated financial statements.\nThe areas most affected by our accounting policies and estimates are revenue recognition, other contract considerations, goodwill, retirement benefit plans, litigation, environmental remediation costs and recoveries, and income taxes. Except for income taxes and litigation matters related to discontinued operations, which are not allocated to our operating segments, these areas affect the financial results of our business segments.\nFor a discussion of all of our accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn our Aerospace and Defense segment, recognition of profit on long-term contracts requires the use of assumptions and estimates related to the contract value or total contract revenue, the total cost at completion and the measurement of progress towards completion. Due to the nature of the programs, developing the estimated total cost at completion requires the use of significant judgment. Estimates are continually evaluated as work progresses and are revised as necessary. Factors that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed include labor productivity, the nature and technical complexity of the work to be performed, availability and cost volatility of materials, subcontractor and vendor performance, warranty costs, volume assumptions, anticipated labor agreements and inflationary trends, schedule and performance delays, availability of funding from the customer, and the recoverability of costs incurred outside the original contract included in any estimates to complete. We review contract performance and cost estimates for some contracts at least monthly and for others at least quarterly and more frequently when circumstances significantly change. When a change in estimate is determined to have an impact on contract profit, we will record a positive or negative adjustment to the statement of operations. Changes in estimates and assumptions related to the status of certain long-term contracts may have a material effect on our operating results. The following table summarizes the impact from changes in estimates and assumptions on the statement of operations on key contracts, representing 83% of our aerospace and defense segment net sales over the last three fiscal years, accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions, except per share amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Favorable effect of the changes in contract estimates on loss from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Favorable effect of the changes in contract estimates on net (loss) income\n</td> <td>24.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Favorable effect of the changes in contract estimates on basic net (loss) income per share\n</td> <td>0.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Favorable effect of the changes in contract estimates on diluted net (loss) income per share\n</td> <td>0.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe fiscal 2015 favorable changes in contract estimates were primarily driven by the following (i) better than expected performance on space launch systems and missile defense programs primarily due to affordability initiatives and lower overhead costs and (ii) unexpected favorable contract performance on close-out activities on the J-2X program. The fiscal 2014 favorable changes in contract estimates were primarily driven by better than expected performance on a space launch system program due to favorable contract negotiations and affordability initiatives partially offset by unanticipated inefficiencies and cost growth on the Antares AJ-26 program. The fiscal 2013 favorable changes in contract estimates was primarily driven by better than expected performance on tactical systems programs due to manufacturing efficiencies and lower overhead costs. The improvements in fiscal 2013 were offset by unexpected cost growth on the Antares AJ-26 program.\nWe consider the nature of the individual underlying contract and the type of products and services provided in determining the proper accounting for a particular contract. Each method is applied consistently to all contracts having similar characteristics, as described below. We typically account for our contracts using the percentage-of-completion method, and progress is measured on a cost-to-cost or units-of-delivery basis. Sales are recognized using various measures of progress depending on the contractual terms and scope of work of the contract. We recognize revenue on a units-of-delivery basis when contracts require unit deliveries on a frequent and routine basis. Sales using this measure of progress are recognized at the contractually agreed upon unit price. Where the scope of work on contracts principally relates to research and/or development efforts, or the contract is predominantly a development effort with few deliverable units, we recognize revenue on a cost-to-cost basis. In this case, sales are recognized as costs are incurred and include estimated earned fees or profits calculated on the basis of the relationship between costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Revenue on service or time and material contracts is recognized when performed. If at any time expected costs exceed the value of the contract, the loss is recognized immediately.\nIf change orders are in dispute or are unapproved in regard to both scope and price they are evaluated as claims. We recognize revenue on claims when recovery of the claim is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Revenue on claims is recognized only to the extent that contract costs related to the claims have been incurred and when it is probable that the claim will result in a bona fide addition to contract value that can be reliably estimated. No profit is recognized on a claim until final settlement occurs.\nCertain government contracts contain cost or performance incentive provisions that provide for increased or decreased fees or profits based upon actual performance against established targets or other criteria. Incentive and award fees, which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer, are considered in estimating profit rates at the time the amounts can be\nreasonably determined and are reasonably assured based on historical experience and anticipated performance. We continually evaluate our performance and incorporate any anticipated changes in penalties and incentives into our revenue and earnings calculations.\nRevenue from real estate asset sales is recognized when a sufficient down-payment has been received, financing has been arranged and title, possession and other attributes of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. The allocation to cost of sales on real estate asset sales is based on a relative fair market value computation of the land sold which includes the basis on our books, capitalized entitlement costs, and an estimate of our continuing financial commitment.\nRevenue that is not derived from long-term development and production contracts, or real estate asset transactions, is recognized when persuasive evidence of a final agreement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price is fixed or determinable and payment from the customer is reasonably assured. Sales are recorded net of provisions for customer pricing allowances.\nOther Contract Considerations\nOur sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products and perform services under contracts with the U.S. government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR and Cost Accounting Standards (\"CAS\"). The FAR and CAS provide guidance on the types of costs that are allowable and allocable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to pension contributions in accordance with the PPA that are in excess of CAS allowable pension costs, charitable contributions, advertising, interest expense, and public relations are unallowable, and therefore not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into agreements with the U.S. government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters.\nWe closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. We review the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. government are reviewed for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the DCAA. Accordingly, we record an allowance on our unbilled receivables for amounts of potential contract overhead costs which may not be successfully negotiated and collected.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired enterprise or assets over the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Tests for impairment of goodwill are performed on an annual basis, or at any other time, if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We evaluated goodwill for impairment as of September 1, 2015 and 2014, and determined that goodwill was not impaired.\nAll of our recorded goodwill resides in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. As of September 1, 2015, we evaluated goodwill using a Step Zero\" analysis and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount. As of September 1, 2014, we performed a Step One\u201d analysis to evaluate goodwill impairment and determined that the fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.\nTo determine the fair value of our Aerospace and Defense reporting unit, we primarily relied upon a discounted cash flow analysis which requires significant assumptions and estimates about future operations, including judgments about expected revenue growth and operating margins, and timing and amounts of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on five-year financial forecasts developed by management. The analysis also involves discounting the future cash flows to a present value using a discount rate that properly accounts for the risk and nature of the reporting unit cash flows and the rates of return debt and equity holders would require to invest their capital in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. In assessing the reasonableness of our estimated fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit, we evaluate the results of the discounted cash flow analysis in light of what investors are paying for similar interests in comparable aerospace and defense companies as of the valuation date. We also ensure that the reporting unit fair value is reasonable given the market value of us as of the valuation date.\nWe evaluate qualitative factors (including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial performance) to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill test. This step is referred to as the Step Zero\" analysis. If it is determined that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will need to proceed to the first step ( Step One\u201d) of the two-step goodwill test. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, relevant events and circumstances as discussed below shall be assessed. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the first and second steps of the impairment test are unnecessary.\nCircumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; loss of key personnel; decline in stock price; and results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded.\nThere can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of its goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions and estimates are incorrect, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods.\nRetirement Benefit Plans\nOur defined benefit pension plan future benefit accrual was discontinued in fiscal 2009. In addition, we provide medical and life insurance benefits ( postretirement benefits\u201d) to certain eligible retired employees, with varied coverage by employee group. Annual charges are made for the cost of the plans, including administrative costs, interest costs on benefit obligations, and net amortization and deferrals, increased or reduced by the return on assets. We also sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan and participation in the plan is available to substantially all employees\nRetirement benefits are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimates. We will recover portions of any required retirement benefits funding through our government contracts. Our pension and medical and life insurance benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts in accordance with GAAP. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expense for the year.\nWe used the following discount rate to determine the benefit obligations for the applicable fiscal year.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pension\nBenefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Medical and\nLife Insurance Benefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>4.26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe used the following assumptions to determine the net periodic benefit expense for the applicable fiscal year.\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Medical and\nLife Insurance Benefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>3.96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.68\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.98\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>8.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Not applicable\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The discount rate represents the current market interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle pension obligations. Based on market conditions, discount rates can experience significant variability. Changes in discount rates can significantly change the liability and, accordingly, the funded status of the pension plan. The assumed discount rate represents the market rate available for investments in high-quality fixed income instruments with maturities matched to the expected benefit payments for pension and medical and life insurance benefit plans.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets represents the rate of earnings expected in the funds invested, and funds to be invested, to provide for anticipated benefit payments to plan participants. We evaluated the plan's historical investment performance, its current and expected asset allocation, and, with input from our external advisors, developed best estimates of future investment performance of the plan's assets. Based on this analysis, we assumed a long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.0% for fiscal 2015. As of November 30, 2015, after evaluating the historical investment performance of plan assets, expected asset allocation, and recent input from our external advisors, we decided to change the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets from 8.0% to 7.0% effective December 1, 2015.\nMarket conditions and interest rates significantly affect assets and liabilities of our pension plans. Pension accounting permits market gains and losses to be deferred and recognized over a period of years. This smoothing\u201d results in the creation of other accumulated income or loss which will be amortized to pension costs in future years. The accounting method we utilize recognizes one-fifth of the unamortized gains and losses in the market-related value of pension assets and all other gains and losses including changes in the discount rate used to calculate benefit costs each year. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return and the actual return on the market-related value of assets which\nsmoothes asset values over three years. Although the smoothing period mitigates some volatility in the calculation of annual pension costs, future pension costs are impacted by changes in the market value of pension plan assets and changes in interest rates.\nIn addition, we maintain medical and life insurance benefits other than pensions that are not funded.\nA one percentage point change in the key assumptions would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligations as of November 30, 2015 and on expense for fiscal 2015:\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefits and\nMedical and Life Insurance Benefits Discount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expected Long-term\nRate of Return\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Assumed Healthcare\nCost Trend Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Periodic\nBenefit Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Projected\nBenefit\nObligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Periodic Pension\nBenefit Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Periodic\nMedical and Life\nInsurance Benefit Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Accumulated\nBenefit\nObligation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase\n</td> <td>(22.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(139.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContingencies and Litigation\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued our estimate of the probable costs and recoveries for resolution of these claims. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions or the effectiveness of strategies related to these proceedings. See Notes 9(b) and 9(c) in notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.\nReserves for Environmental Remediation and Recoverable from the U.S. Government and Other Third Parties for Environmental Remediation Costs\nFor a discussion of our accounting for environmental remediation obligations and costs and related legal matters, see Environmental Matters\u201d above and Notes 9(c) and 9(d) in notes to consolidated financial statements.\nWe accrue for costs associated with the remediation of environmental contamination when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred, and when our costs can be reasonably estimated. Management has a well-established process in place to identify and monitor our environmental exposures. In most cases, only a range of reasonably probable costs can be estimated. In establishing the reserves, the most probable estimated amount is used when determinable, and the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Environmental reserves include the costs of completing remedial investigation and feasibility studies, remedial and corrective actions, regulatory oversight costs, the cost of operation and maintenance of the remedial action plan, and employee compensation costs for employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of time to remediation efforts. Calculation of environmental reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual environmental site and considers factors such as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Such estimates are based on the expected costs of investigation and remediation and the likelihood that other potentially responsible parties will be able to fulfill their commitments at sites where we may be jointly or severally liable.\nAt the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, we record an asset for estimated future recoveries that are estimable and probable. Some of our environmental costs are eligible for future recovery in the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government and under existing third party agreements. We consider the recovery probable based on the Global Settlement Agreement, Northrop Agreement, government contracting regulations, and our long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs.\nIncome Taxes\nWe file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return for the Company and our 100% owned consolidated subsidiaries. The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date of the change.\nThe carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including our past and future performance, the market environment in which we operate, the utilization of tax attributes in the past, the length of carryback and carryforward periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies.\nDespite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged by taxing authorities. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. Our tax reserves reflect the difference between the tax benefit claimed on tax returns and the amount recognized in the financial statements. The accounting standards provide guidance for the recognition and measurement in financial statements for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process, the first step being recognition. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. As the examination process progresses with tax authorities, adjustments to tax reserves may be necessary to reflect taxes payable upon settlement. Tax reserve adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Tax reserve adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I could not understand the provided table.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nUnless otherwise indicated or required by the context, as used in this Form 10-K, the terms we,\u201d our\u201d and us\u201d refer to Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries that are consolidated in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d).\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Report, the risk factors appearing in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report, and the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements appearing at the beginning of Item 1. Business of this Report. Historical results set forth in Item 6. Selected Financial Data and Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Report should not be taken as indicative of our future operations.\nRestatement\nAs indicated in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K, we corrected errors in our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the Restated Periods primarily related to the following matters: (i) purchase accounting associated with contracts acquired as part of the acquisition of the Rocketdyne Business; (ii) contract accounting related to subsequent modifications to one significant acquired contract; (iii) contract accounting related to the improper recognition of sales associated with incentives; and (iv) other individually immaterial items. A summary of the impact to pretax income (loss) from continuing operations by reporting period is presented below (in millions):\n\n___________\n(1) Our errors associated with purchase accounting primarily related to the following: (i) fair value assessment of Rocketdyne Business acquired customer contracts at the acquisition date following the close of the transaction. The Company failed to fair value three acquired contracts in purchase accounting; and (ii) the estimates of the Rocketdyne Business contracts' percentage of completion used to recognize net sales should have been based on its estimate of remaining effort on such contracts at the acquisition date instead of the inception date of the contract.\n(2) We did not appropriately account for one significant Rocketdyne Business contract amendment. Instead of being accounted for as a modification, the amendment was accounted for as a new contract.\n(3) We immediately recognized incentives as sales based on the full amount received rather than on the percentage of completion of the related contract.\nThe correction of the matters described above resulted in the following adjustments to the previously issued consolidated financial statements: (i) an increase of $0.3 million, or $0.00 loss per share, to net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2015; (ii) a decrease of $3.0 million, or $0.06 loss per share, to net loss for fiscal 2014; and (iii) a decrease of $5.0 million, or $0.06 diluted income per share, to net income for fiscal 2013. A summary of the impact to net (loss) income on the consolidated statements of operations by reporting period is presented below (in millions):\n\nOverview\nWe are a manufacturer of aerospace and defense products and systems which develops and manufactures propulsion systems for defense and space applications, and armaments for precision tactical and long-range weapon systems applications. We also have a real estate segment that includes activities related to the re-zoning, entitlement, sale, and leasing of our excess real estate assets. Our continuing operations are organized into two segments:\nAerospace and Defense - includes the operations of our wholly-owned subsidiary Aerojet Rocketdyne, a leading technology-based designer, developer and manufacturer of aerospace and defense products and systems for the U.S. government, including the DoD, NASA, major aerospace and defense prime contractors as well as portions of the commercial sector. Aerojet Rocketdyne is a world-recognized engineering and manufacturing company that specializes in the development and production of propulsion systems for defense and space applications, armament systems for precision tactical systems and munitions, and is considered a domestic market leader in launch propulsion, in-space propulsion, missile defense propulsion, tactical missile propulsion and hypersonic propulsion systems.\nReal Estate - includes the activities of our wholly-owned subsidiary Easton related to the re-zoning, entitlement, sale, and leasing of our excess real estate assets. We own approximately 11,500 acres of land adjacent to U.S. Highway 50 between Rancho Cordova and Folsom, California east of Sacramento. We are currently in the process of seeking zoning changes and other governmental approvals on a portion of the Sacramento Land to optimize its value. In addition, we are currently in the process of completing certain infrastructure improvements to the Sacramento Land to enhance its value.\nA summary of the significant financial highlights for fiscal 2015 which management uses to evaluate our operating performance and financial condition is presented below.\n \u2022 Net sales for fiscal 2015 totaled $1,708.3 million compared to $1,602.2 million for fiscal 2014. \n \u2022 Net loss for fiscal 2015 was $(16.2) million, or $(0.27) loss per share, compared to net loss of $(50.0) million, or $(0.86) loss per share, for fiscal 2014. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDAP (Non-GAAP measure*) for fiscal 2015 was $217.9 million, or 12.8% of net sales, compared to $181.5 million, or 11.3% of net sales, for fiscal 2014. \n \u2022 Segment performance (Non-GAAP measure*) before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefit expense, and unusual items was $200.1 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $152.8 million for fiscal 2014. \n \u2022 Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 totaled $65.1 million, compared to $150.6 million in fiscal 2014. \n \u2022 Free cash flow (Non-GAAP measure*) in fiscal 2015 totaled $28.3 million, compared to $107.2 million in fiscal 2014. \n \u2022 As of November 30, 2015, we had $2.4 billion of total funded contract backlog compared to $2.2 billion as of November 30, 2014. \n \u2022 As of November 30, 2015, we had $4.1 billion of total contract backlog (total funded and unfunded backlog) compared to $3.1 billion as of November 30, 2014. \n \u2022 As of November 30, 2015, we had $440.9 million in net debt (Non-GAAP measure*) compared to $516.3 million as of November 30, 2014.  _________\n* We provide Non-GAAP measures as a supplement to financial results based on GAAP. A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is presented later in the Management's Discussion and Analysis under the heading Operating Segment Information\u201d and Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nOur fiscal year ends on November 30 of each year. The fiscal year of our subsidiary, Aerojet Rocketdyne, ends on the last Saturday of November. As a result of the 2013 calendar, Aerojet Rocketdyne had 14 weeks of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 13 weeks of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and 2014. The additional week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 accounted for $27.8 million in additional net sales.\nOn January 20, 2016, our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year-end from November 30 of each year to December 31 of each year.\nIn July 2012, we signed the Original Purchase Agreement with UTC to acquire the Rocketdyne Business from UTC for $550 million. On June 12, 2013, we entered into an Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement with UTC, which amended and restated the Original Purchase Agreement, as amended. On June 14, 2013, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the Rocketdyne Business pursuant to the Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement. The aggregate consideration to UTC was $411 million which represents the initial purchase price of $550 million reduced by $55 million relating to the potential future acquisition of UTC's 50% ownership interest of RD Amross (a joint venture with NPO Energomash of Khimki, Russia which sells RD-180 engines to RD Amross) and the portion of the UTC business that markets and supports the sale of RD-180 engines. The acquisition of UTC's 50% ownership interest of RD Amross and UTC's related business was contingent upon certain conditions including receipt of certain Russian governmental regulatory approvals, which was not obtained. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement, on June 14, 2015, our obligations to consummate the RDA Acquisition expired.\nThe unaudited pro forma information for fiscal 2013 set forth below gives effect to the Acquisition as if it had occurred at the beginning of the year. These amounts have been calculated after applying our accounting policies and adjusting the results of the Rocketdyne Business to reflect depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value\nadjustments to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets had been applied as at the beginning of the year, together with the tax effects, as applicable. The pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that actually would have been achieved had the Acquisition been consummated as of that time or that may result in the future.\n\nWe are operating in an environment that is characterized by both increasing complexity in the global security environment, as well as continuing worldwide economic pressures. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on delivering excellent performance to our customers, driving improvements and efficiencies across our operations, and creating value through the enhancement and expansion of our business.\nWe continuously evaluate a broad range of options that could be implemented to increase operational efficiency across all sites, and improve our overall market competitiveness. Our decisions will be focused on moving us forward to solidify our leadership in the propulsion markets.\nSome of the significant challenges we face are as follows: dependence upon U.S. government programs and contracts, future reductions or changes in U.S. government spending in our markets, implementation of our CIP, environmental matters, capital structure, and underfunded pension plan.\nMajor Customers\nThe principal end user customers of our products and technology are agencies of the U.S. government. Since a majority of our sales are, directly or indirectly, to the U.S. government, funding for the purchase of our products and services generally follows trends in U.S. aerospace and defense spending. However, individual U.S. government agencies, which include the military services, NASA, the Missile Defense Agency, and the prime contractors that serve these agencies, exercise independent purchasing power within budget top-line\u201d limits. Therefore, sales to the U.S. government are not regarded as sales to one customer, but rather each contracting agency is viewed as a separate customer.\nCustomers that represented more than 10% of net sales for the periods presented are as follows: \n__________\n * Less than 10%.  Our sales to each of the major customers listed above involve several product lines and programs.\nSales to the U.S. government and its agencies, including sales to our significant customers discussed above, were as follows (dollars in millions): \nThe Standard Missile program, which is comprised of several contracts and is included in U.S. government sales, represented 14%, 12%, and 22% of net sales for fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. In addition, the THAAD program, which is comprised of several contracts and is included in U.S. government sales, represented 13%, 12%, and 3% of net sales for fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.\nIndustry Update\nOur primary aerospace and defense customers include the DoD and its agencies, NASA, and the prime contractors that supply products to these customers. We are seeing more opportunities for commercial launch and in-space business. In addition, sales to our aerospace and defense customers that provide products to international customers continue to grow. However, we continue to rely on particular levels of U.S. government spending on propulsion systems for defense, space and armament systems, precision tactical weapon systems and munitions applications, and our backlog depends, in large part, on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we are involved. These funding levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but rather follow the cycle of general public policy and political support for this type of funding. Moreover, although our contracts often contemplate that our services will be performed over a period of several years, the U.S. Congress must appropriate funds for a given program and the U.S. President must sign government budget legislation each GFY and may significantly increase, decrease or eliminate, funding for a program. A decrease in DoD and/or NASA expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a material program in which we are or hope to be involved, or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government outlays, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011 established statutory limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, or budgets caps, for both defense and non-defense over the next 10 years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 provided temporary relief to the Budget Control Act of 2011 cap levels in GFY 2014 and 2015 and eased sequestration spending cuts to the DoD and other federal agencies (e.g., NASA) for GFY 2014 and 2015, paving the way for eventual agreements on GFY 2014 and 2015 appropriations for all federal agencies. Similarly, in November 2015, the U.S. President signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, providing another two years of relief to the Budget Control Act cap numbers. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 covers both GFY 2016 and 2017 and allows for increased spending levels for DoD and other U.S. government agencies including NASA. This paved the way for the U.S. Congress to pass and the U.S. President to sign into law a $1.1 trillion Omnibus\u201d appropriations bill for GFY 2016, funding all government agencies. The defense portion of the bill provides $514.1\nbillion in base defense funding and $58.6 billion in overseas contingency operations. The base funding level is $12.8 billion below the GFY 2016 budget request while the overseas contingency operations portion is $7.7 billion above the GFY 2016 budget request. The NASA portion contains a top line of $19.3 billion, a $1.3 billion increase over GFY 2015 level.\nDespite overall U.S. government budget pressures, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from funding in DoD and NASA priority areas. This view reflects the DoD's strategic guidance report released in January 2012, and the 2014 QDR which affirms support for many of our core programs and explicitly states Missile Defense, Space, Nuclear Deterrence, and Precision Strike as key capabilities for the DoD to preserve.\nThe NASA Authorization Act has again identified the SLS program as one of its top priorities in the NASA GFY 2016 budget. The SLS program also has enjoyed wide, bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress. We maintain a strong relationship with NASA and our propulsion systems have been powering NASA launch vehicles and spacecraft since the inception of the U.S. space program. Our booster, upper stage and Orion vehicle propulsion systems are currently baselined on the new SLS vehicle and both upper stage and booster engines are in development for future SLS variants. Due to the retirement of the space shuttle fleet, U.S. astronauts are now dependent on Russian Soyuz flights for access to and from the ISS for the better part of this decade. NASA has been working to re-establish U.S. manned space capability as soon as possible through development of a new space taxi\u201d to ferry astronauts and cargo to the ISS. In 2014, Boeing's CST-100 Starliner capsule, powered by Aerojet Rocketdyne propulsion, was selected by NASA to transport astronauts to and from the ISS. As Boeing's teammate, Aerojet Rocketdyne will be providing the propulsion system for this new vehicle, thereby supplementing its work for NASA on the SLS designed for manned deep space exploration. In both instances, we have significant propulsion content and we look forward to supporting these generational programs for NASA.\nThe competitive dynamics of our multi-faceted marketplace vary by product sector and customer as we experience many of the same influences felt by the broader aerospace and defense industry. The large majority of products we manufacture are highly complex, technically sophisticated and extremely hazardous to build, demanding rigorous manufacturing procedures and highly specialized manufacturing equipment. While historically these factors, coupled with the high cost to establish the infrastructure required to meet these needs, posed substantial barriers to entry, modern design tools and manufacturing techniques (additive manufacturing) available to new entrants with the ability to self-fund start-up as well as development costs has led to increased competition in space related markets. To date, the competition has been limited to a few participants who tend to be narrowly focused on products that are sub-elements of our overall product portfolio. For example, entrepreneurs such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, who have been or are in the process of developing liquid fuel propulsion capabilities are primarily focused on the development of space propulsion systems for heavy lift launch vehicles and are not pursuing or participating in the missile defense or tactical propulsion business segments that make up a substantial portion of our overall business. These new entrepreneurs have signaled their intent to compete primarily on price and are therefore bringing pressure to bear on existing cost paradigms and manufacturing methodologies.\nCompetitive Improvement Program\nIn March 2015, we initiated the CIP comprised of activities and initiatives aimed at reducing costs in order for us to continue to compete successfully. The company-wide initiative is being undertaken after a comprehensive assessment of our product portfolio to underpin Aerojet Rocketdyne's technological and competitive leadership in our markets through continued research and development. The CIP is composed of three major components: (i) facilities optimization and footprint reduction; (ii) product affordability; and (iii) reduced administrative and overhead costs. Under the CIP, we expect an estimated 500 headcount reduction in our total employee population. We currently estimate that we will incur restructuring and related costs over the next four years totaling approximately $110 million. When fully implemented, we anticipate that the CIP will result in annual cost savings of approximately $145 million beginning in fiscal 2019. As a result of this effort, we will be better positioned to deliver our innovative, high quality and reliable products at a lower cost to our customers. The CIP costs will consist primarily of severance and other employee related costs totaling approximately $43 million, operating facility costs totaling approximately $27 million, and $40 million for other costs relating to product re-qualification, knowledge transfer and other CIP implementation costs. A summary of our CIP reserve activity in fiscal 2015 is shown below:\n\nThe costs associated with the CIP will be a component of our U.S. government forward pricing rates, and therefore, will be recovered through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. In addition to the employee-related CIP\nobligations, we incurred non-cash accelerated depreciation expense of $0.8 million in fiscal 2015 associated with changes in the estimated useful life of long-lived assets impacted by the CIP.\nAs part of our ongoing effort to optimize business resources and achieve headcount reduction goals established through the CIP, we offered a Voluntary Reduction in Force (\"VRIF\") in July 2015 to our employees. In connection with the VRIF, we recorded a liability of $2.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, consisting of costs for severance, employee-related benefits and other associated expenses. These costs will be a component of our U.S. government forward pricing rates, and therefore, will be recovered through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government.\nSuccessful implementation of the CIP initiative will directly benefit our ability to win important, new development work thereby advancing our wide range of next generation propulsion solutions including our newest liquid booster engine, the AR1. Here we plan to supplement the benefits from the CIP by continuing to invest in significant company-funded research and development activities toward the successful development of this engine to meet current and future U.S. space launch needs.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur current and former business operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes. Our policy is to conduct our business with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We continually assess compliance with these regulations and we believe our current operations are materially in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.\nA summary of our recoverable amounts, environmental reserves, and range of liability, as of November 30, 2015 is presented below:\n\n_____\n (1) Excludes the receivable from Northrop of $68.7 million as of November 30, 2015 related to environmental costs already paid (and therefore not reserved) by the Company in prior years and reimbursable under the Northrop Agreement.  Most of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these future costs are allowable to be included in our contracts with the U.S. government and allocable to Northrop until the cumulative expenditure limitation is reached. See Note 9(c) and (d) of the notes to consolidated financial statements and \"Environmental Matters\" below for summary of our environmental reserve activity.\nCapital Structure\nWe have a substantial amount of debt for which we are required to make interest and principal payments. Interest on long-term financing is not a recoverable cost under our U.S. government contracts. As of November 30, 2015, we had $652.0 million of debt principal outstanding. The fair value of the debt outstanding at November 30, 2015 was $751.5 million.\nRetirement Benefits\nWe expect to make cash contributions of approximately $23 million to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan in fiscal 2016. We estimate that approximately 83% of our unfunded pension obligation as of November 30, 2015 is related to Aerojet Rocketdyne which will be recoverable through our U.S. government contracts.\nThe funded status of our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan may be adversely affected by the investment experience of the plan's assets, by any changes in U.S. law and by changes in the statutory interest rates used by tax-qualified pension plans in the U.S. to calculate funding requirements. Accordingly, if the performance of our plan's assets does not meet our assumptions, if there are changes to the IRS regulations or other applicable law or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our future contributions to our underfunded pension plans could be higher than we expect.\nAdditionally, the level of returns on retirement benefit assets, changes in interest rates, changes in legislation, and other factors affect our financial results. The timing of recognition of pension expense or income in our financial statements differs from the timing of the required pension funding under PPA or the amount of funding that can be recorded in our overhead rates\nthrough our U.S. government contracting business. Our earnings are positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our employee retirement benefit plans.\nResults of Operations\n\nNet Sales:\n\n* Primary reason for change. The increase in net sales was primarily due to the following: (i) an increase of $84.3 million in space advanced programs primarily driven by the RS-25 program which is currently engaged in a significant development and integration effort in support of the SLS development program and increased development work on the Orion program partially offset by the successful completion of current J-2X program; (ii) an increase of $80.3 million in missile defense and strategic systems programs primarily driven by the increased deliveries on the THAAD and Standard Missile programs; and (iii) sale of approximately 550 acres of our Sacramento Land for $42.0 million. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $109.7 million in space launch programs primarily associated with the RL10 and RS-68 programs as a result of the timing of deliveries and costs incurred on these multi-year contracts and lower sales related to the Antares AJ-26 program close-out (see discussion below).\n** Primary reason for change. The increase in net sales was primarily due to the net sales from the acquired Rocketdyne Business. The Rocketdyne Business generated sales of $681.9 million in fiscal 2014 compared to $311.8 million in fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2014 and 2013 results include 12 months and 51/2 months, respectively, of the acquired Rocketdyne Business. The increase in net sales also included increased deliveries on the AJ60, THAAD, and Orion programs totaling $71.9 million. The increase in net sales was partially offset by (i) a decrease in the various Standard Missile contracts primarily from the transitioning of the Standard Missile-3 Block IB contract from development activities to low-rate initial production, decreased development activities for the TDACS for the Standard Missile-3 Block IIA contract, and the cessation of deliveries on the\nStandard Missile-1 Regrain contract in fiscal 2014 as a result of contract completion; (ii) an additional week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 resulting in $27.8 million in net sales; (iii) lower sales a result of the completion of the T3 IIA and IIB contracts as the program entered the next development phase; and (iv) decreased deliveries and changes in the estimated measurement of progress toward completion on the Antares program.\nCost of Sales (exclusive of items shown separately below):\n\n* Primary reason for change. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales excluding retirement benefit expense and the step-up in fair value of inventory is primarily due to (i) land sale of approximately 550 acres of Sacramento Land resulting in gross profit of $30.6 million, 1.8% of net sales, and (ii) the close-out of the Antares AJ-26 program. Aerojet Rocketdyne entered into a Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement (the Agreement\u201d) with Orbital Sciences Corporation ( Orbital\u201d) pursuant to which the parties mutually agreed to a termination for convenience of the contract relating to the provision by Aerojet Rocketdyne of 20 AJ-26 liquid propulsion rocket engines to Orbital for the Antares program (the Contract\u201d). The Agreement also settles all claims the parties may have had against one another arising out of the Contract and the launch failure that occurred on October 28, 2014 of an Antares launch vehicle carrying the Cygnus ORB-3 service and cargo module. We incurred a $50.0 million legal settlement charge reported as an unusual item and not included in cost of sales related to the legal settlement. See table below and Note 9(b) of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\n\n** Primary reason for change. The increase in cost of sales excluding retirement benefit expense and step-up in fair value of inventory as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to $23.6 million of cost growth in fiscal 2014 on the Antares AJ-26 program, including the cost to repair or replace engines as necessary in light of the previously reported engine test failures, an associated increase in hardware inspections and corrective actions on remaining engines, costs to repair the damaged test stand, and costs resulting from delayed deliveries.\nAR1 Research and Development (\"R&D\"):\n\n* Primary reason for change. During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we began separately reporting the portion of the engine development expenses associated with our newest liquid booster engine, the AR1, which are currently not allocated across all contracts and programs in progress under U.S. governmental contractual arrangements. See additional discussion in Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d): \n* Primary reason for change. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily driven by: (i) an increase of $6.1 million in non-cash retirement benefit plan expense (see discussion of Retirement Benefit Plans\u201d below) and (ii) an increase of $2.9 million in stock-based compensation primarily as a result of increases in the fair value of the stock appreciation rights.\n** Primary reason for change. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily driven by (i) lower non-cash retirement benefit expense (see discussion of Retirement Benefit Plans\u201d below) and (ii) a decrease of $8.4 million in stock-based compensation primarily as a result of decreases in the fair value of the stock appreciation rights.\nDepreciation and Amortization:\n\n* Primary reason for change. The increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to the non-cash accelerated depreciation expense of $0.8 million in fiscal 2015 associated with changes in the estimated useful life of long-lived assets impacted by the CIP.\n** Primary reason for change. The increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to (i) an increase in depreciation expense related to the Rocketdyne Business since the acquisition; (ii) an increase of $7.0 million of amortization of intangible assets associated with the Rocketdyne Business which is not allocable to our U.S. government contracts; and (iii) an increase of $3.1 million of depreciation expense associated with the ERP system which was placed into service in June 2013.\nOther Expense, net:\n\n* Primary reason for change. The decrease in other expense, net was primarily due to a decrease of $9.8 million in unusual items charges (see discussion of unusual items below). The decrease in unusual items was partially offset by an increase of $6.5 million in environmental remediation expense primarily associated with higher reserve requirements at the BPOU site offset by the Advance Agreement with the U.S. government entered into in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 (see discussion of Environmental Matters\u201d below).\n** Primary reason for change. The increase in other expense, net was primarily due to (i) an increase of $37.2 million in unusual item charges (see discussion of unusual items below); (ii) an increase of $2.8 million in losses on the disposal of long-lived assets; and (iii) an increase of $2.4 million in environmental remediation expenses (see discussion of Environmental Matters\u201d below).\nTotal unusual items expense, a component of other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations, was as follows:\n\nFiscal 2015 Activity:\nWe recorded an expense of $50.0 million associated with a legal settlement. See Note 9(b) of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nWe retired $76.0 million principal amount of our delayed draw term loan resulting in $1.9 million of losses associated with the write-off of deferred financing fees.\nFiscal 2014 Activity:\nA summary of the loss on the 4 1/16% Debentures repurchased during fiscal 2014 is as follows (in millions):\n\nWe recorded a charge of $0.2 million related to an amendment to the Senior Credit Facility.\nWe recorded $0.9 million for realized losses and interest associated with the failure to register with the SEC the issuance of certain of our common shares under the defined contribution 401(k) employee benefit plan.\nFiscal 2013 Activity:\nWe recorded a charge of $0.5 million related to a legal settlement.\nWe recorded ($1.0) million in gains net of interest associated with the failure to register with the SEC the issuance of certain of our common shares under the defined contribution 401(k) employee benefit plan.\nWe incurred expenses of $20.0 million, including internal labor costs of $1.4 million, related to the Rocketdyne Business acquisition.\nA summary of our losses on the 4 1/16% Debentures repurchased during fiscal 2013 is as follows (in millions):\n\nInterest Income:\n\n* Primary reason for change. Interest income was essentially unchanged for the periods presented.\nInterest Expense:\n\n* Primary reason for change. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the $49.0 million of 4 1/16% Debentures that were converted to 5.5 million shares of our common stock in fiscal 2015 (including the associated deferred financing costs).\n** Primary reason for change. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to (i) two additional months in fiscal 2014 of interest expense associated with the issuance of the 7 1/8% Notes and (ii) the issuance of $89.0 million under the subordinated delayed draw term loan facility in fiscal 2014. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by the 4 1/16% Debentures repurchased during fiscal 2014.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit): \nThe following table shows the reconciling items between the income tax (benefit) provision using the federal statutory rate and our reported income tax provision (benefit).\n\nIn fiscal 2015, our effective tax rate was an income tax expense of 1.8% on a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $16.8 million. Our effective tax rate differed from the 35.0% statutory federal income tax rate due largely to state income taxes and certain non-deductible interest expense partially offset by the retroactive reinstatement of the federal R&D credit and the benefit related to manufacturing deductions.\nIn fiscal 2014, our effective tax rate was an income tax expense of 49.4% on a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $33.0 million. Our effective tax rate differed from the 35% statutory federal income tax rate due largely to the non-deductible premiums paid upon the redemption of portions of the convertible debt, state income taxes, impacts from the final research and development credit study, the benefit related to manufacturing deductions, and certain non-deductible interest expense.\nIn fiscal 2013, our effective tax rate was an income tax benefit of 555.7% on a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $35.7 million. Our effective tax rate differed from the 35% statutory federal income tax rate due largely to the release of a significant portion of the valuation allowance previously recorded against deferred tax assets, the impact of state income taxes, and certain non-deductible interest expense. We released $282.4 million of the valuation allowance that existed at the beginning of the year, of which approximately $178.7 million was recorded as an income tax benefit to continuing operations, $1.1 million to discontinued operations, and $102.6 million was recorded in other comprehensive income.\nThe carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. We need $473.6 million in pre-tax income and $409.9 million in other comprehensive income to realize the net deferred tax assets as of November 30, 2015. We project that future taxable income will increase as a result of increased income from continuing operations resulting from improved contract profit margins related to the Rocketdyne acquisition integration and improved margins beginning in fiscal 2015 due to anticipated contributions to our tax qualified defined benefit pension plan, which are recoverable through our U.S. government contracts. These increases in income from continuing operations will be partially offset by book to tax adjustments, primarily related to retirement benefit plan payments, state tax deductions, and our manufacturing deductions.\nThe timing of recording or releasing a valuation allowance requires significant management judgment. The amount of the valuation allowance released by us represents a portion of deferred tax assets that was deemed more-likely-than-not that we will realize the benefits based on the analysis in which the positive evidence outweighed the negative evidence.\nA valuation allowance is required when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized. Establishment and removal of a valuation allowance requires management to consider all positive and negative evidence and make a judgmental decision regarding the amount of valuation allowance required as of a reporting date. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. In the evaluation as of November 30, 2015 and 2014, management has considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to the following:\nPositive evidence\n \u2022 The three year comprehensive cumulative income position as of November 30, 2015; \n \u2022 Our recent history of generating taxable income which has allowed for the utilization of tax credit carryforwards, and the expected taxable income position for the current year; \n \u2022 Pension rules that allow us to recover pension funding cash contributions through our U.S. government contracts; \n \u2022 Continuing positive results of operations from the acquisition of the Rocketdyne Business; \n \u2022 Establishment and execution of the Competitive Improvement Program evidencing increasing growth and profitability; \n \u2022 Increase in our contract backlog; and \n \u2022 Favorable trends with respect to the market value of certain real estate assets.  Negative evidence\n \u2022 Our exposure to environmental remediation obligations and the related uncertainty as to the ultimate exposure upon settlement; \n \u2022 The significance of our defined benefit pension obligation and related impact it could have in future years; \n \u2022 The additional indebtedness incurred in fiscal 2013 related to the acquisition of the Rocketdyne Business that continues to generate interest expense; and \n \u2022 Potential three-year cumulative loss position at the end of fiscal 2016.  During fiscal 2015 and 2014, we continued to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance and have concluded in each quarter, including year end, that the amount of valuation allowance currently recorded was appropriate. We will continue to evaluate the ability to realize our net deferred tax assets to determine if an increase to our valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nThe Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 passed in December 2015, retroactively reinstating the federal R&D credit and \"bonus\" depreciation. As a result, we expect to record an estimated benefit to our income tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 of approximately $2.7 million related to the R&D credit. The impact of the additional tax depreciation will reduce our income taxes payable and long-term deferred tax assets by approximately $3 million.\nRetirement Benefit Plans:\nComponents of retirement benefit expense are: \nThe increase in retirement benefit expense in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to higher actuarial losses arising from the November 30, 2014 measurement associated with the updated mortality assumption and a decrease in the discount rate used to determine our retirement benefit plans' obligations at November 30, 2014. The discount rate was 3.96% as of November 30, 2014 compared to 4.54% as of November 30, 2013.\nWe estimate that our non-cash retirement benefit expense will be approximately $67 million in fiscal 2016.\nMarket conditions and interest rates significantly affect the assets and liabilities of our pension plans. Pension accounting permits market gains and losses to be deferred and recognized over a period of years. This smoothing\u201d results in the creation of other accumulated income or losses which will be amortized to retirement benefit expense or benefit in future years. The accounting method we utilize recognizes one-fifth of the unamortized gains and losses associated with the market-related value of pension assets and all other gains and losses, including changes in the discount rate used to calculate benefit costs each year. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return and the actual return on the market-related value of assets which smoothes market related asset values over three years. Although the smoothing period mitigates some volatility in the calculation of annual retirement benefit expense, future expenses are impacted by changes in the market value of pension plan assets and changes in interest rates.\nAdditionally, we sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan and participation in the plan is available to substantially all employees. Our contributions to the 401(k) plan were $24.9 million in fiscal 2015, $24.4 million in fiscal 2014, and $14.7 million in fiscal 2013. The cost is recoverable through our overhead rates on our U.S. government contracts.\nOperating Segment Information:\nWe evaluate our operating segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment performance. Segment performance, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, represents net sales from continuing operations less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for unusual items relating to the segment. Excluded from segment performance are: corporate income and expenses, interest expense, interest income, income taxes, legacy income or expenses, and unusual items not related to the segment. We believe that segment performance provides information useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance. In addition, we provide the Non-GAAP financial measure of our operational performance called segment performance before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefit expense, Rocketdyne purchase accounting adjustments, and unusual items. We believe the exclusion of the items listed above permits an evaluation and a comparison of results for ongoing business operations, and it is on this basis that management internally assesses operational performance.\nAerospace and Defense Segment\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nUnless otherwise indicated or required by the context, as used in this Form 10-K, the terms we,\u201d our\u201d and us\u201d refer to Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries that are consolidated in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d).\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in Item 8.

A summary of the impact to pretax income (loss) from continuing operations by reporting period is presented below (in millions):\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First nine months of fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase accounting for contracts acquired as part of the acquisition of the Rocketdyne Business (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract accounting related to subsequent modifications to one significant acquired Rocketdyne Business contract (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract accounting related to improper recognition of sales incentives (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other individually immaterial items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________\n(1) Our errors associated with purchase accounting primarily related to the following: (i) fair value assessment of Rocketdyne Business acquired customer contracts at the acquisition date following the close of the transaction. The Company failed to fair value three acquired contracts in purchase accounting; and (ii) the estimates of the Rocketdyne Business contracts' percentage of completion used to recognize net sales should have been based on its estimate of remaining effort on such contracts at the acquisition date instead of the inception date of the contract.\n(2) We did not appropriately account for one significant Rocketdyne Business contract amendment. Instead of being accounted for as a modification, the amendment was accounted for as a new contract.\n(3) We immediately recognized incentives as sales based on the full amount received rather than on the percentage of completion of the related contract.\nThe correction of the matters described above resulted in the following adjustments to the previously issued consolidated financial statements: (i) an increase of $0.3 million, or $0.00 loss per share, to net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2015; (ii) a decrease of $3.0 million, or $0.06 loss per share, to net loss for fiscal 2014; and (iii) a decrease of $5.0 million, or $0.06 diluted income per share, to net income for fiscal 2013.

We also have a real estate segment that includes activities related to the re-zoning, entitlement, sale, and leasing of our excess real estate assets. Our continuing operations are organized into two segments:\nAerospace and Defense - includes the operations of our wholly-owned subsidiary Aerojet Rocketdyne, a leading technology-based designer, developer and manufacturer of aerospace and defense products and systems for the U.S. government, including the DoD, NASA, major aerospace and defense prime contractors as well as portions of the commercial sector. Aerojet Rocketdyne is a world-recognized engineering and manufacturing company that specializes in the development and production of propulsion systems for defense and space applications, armament systems for precision tactical systems and munitions, and is considered a domestic market leader in launch propulsion, in-space propulsion, missile defense propulsion, tactical missile propulsion and hypersonic propulsion systems.\nReal Estate - includes the activities of our wholly-owned subsidiary Easton related to the re-zoning, entitlement, sale, and leasing of our excess real estate assets. We own approximately 11,500 acres of land adjacent to U.S. Highway 50 between Rancho Cordova and Folsom, California east of Sacramento. We are currently in the process of seeking zoning changes and other governmental approvals on a portion of the Sacramento Land to optimize its value. In addition, we are currently in the process of completing certain infrastructure improvements to the Sacramento Land to enhance its value.\nA summary of the significant financial highlights for fiscal 2015 which management uses to evaluate our operating performance and financial condition is presented below.\n \u2022 Net sales for fiscal 2015 totaled $1,708.3 million compared to $1,602.2 million for fiscal 2014. \n \u2022 Net loss for fiscal 2015 was $(16.2) million, or $(0.27) loss per share, compared to net loss of $(50.0) million, or $(0.86) loss per share, for fiscal 2014. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDAP (Non-GAAP measure*) for fiscal 2015 was $217.9 million, or 12.8% of net sales, compared to $181.5 million, or 11.3% of net sales, for fiscal 2014. \n \u2022 Segment performance (Non-GAAP measure*) before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefit expense, and unusual items was $200.1 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $152.8 million for fiscal 2014. \n \u2022 Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 totaled $65.1 million, compared to $150.6 million in fiscal 2014. \n \u2022 Free cash flow (Non-GAAP measure*) in fiscal 2015 totaled $28.3 million, compared to $107.2 million in fiscal 2014. \n \u2022 As of November 30, 2015, we had $2.4 billion of total funded contract backlog compared to $2.2 billion as of November 30, 2014. \n \u2022 As of November 30, 2015, we had $4.1 billion of total contract backlog (total funded and unfunded backlog) compared to $3.1 billion as of November 30, 2014. \n \u2022 As of November 30, 2015, we had $440.9 million in net debt (Non-GAAP measure*) compared to $516.3 million as of November 30, 2014.  _________\n* We provide Non-GAAP measures as a supplement to financial results based on GAAP. A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is presented later in the Management's Discussion and Analysis under the heading Operating Segment Information\u201d and Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nOur fiscal year ends on November 30 of each year. The fiscal year of our subsidiary, Aerojet Rocketdyne, ends on the last Saturday of November. As a result of the 2013 calendar, Aerojet Rocketdyne had 14 weeks of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 13 weeks of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and 2014. The additional week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 accounted for $27.8 million in additional net sales.\nOn January 20, 2016, our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year-end from November 30 of each year to December 31 of each year.\nIn July 2012, we signed the Original Purchase Agreement with UTC to acquire the Rocketdyne Business from UTC for $550 million. On June 12, 2013, we entered into an Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement with UTC, which amended and restated the Original Purchase Agreement, as amended. On June 14, 2013, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the Rocketdyne Business pursuant to the Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement. The aggregate consideration to UTC was $411 million which represents the initial purchase price of $550 million reduced by $55 million relating to the potential future acquisition of UTC's 50% ownership interest of RD Amross (a joint venture with NPO Energomash of Khimki, Russia which sells RD-180 engines to RD Amross) and the portion of the UTC business that markets and supports the sale of RD-180 engines. The acquisition of UTC's 50% ownership interest of RD Amross and UTC's related business was contingent upon certain conditions including receipt of certain Russian governmental regulatory approvals, which was not obtained. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement, on June 14, 2015, our obligations to consummate the RDA Acquisition expired.\nThe unaudited pro forma information for fiscal 2013 set forth below gives effect to the Acquisition as if it had occurred at the beginning of the year. These amounts have been calculated after applying our accounting policies and adjusting the results of the Rocketdyne Business to reflect depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value\nadjustments to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets had been applied as at the beginning of the year, together with the tax effects, as applicable. The pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that actually would have been achieved had the Acquisition been consummated as of that time or that may result in the future.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions, except per share amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,378.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,757.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic income per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted income per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are operating in an environment that is characterized by both increasing complexity in the global security environment, as well as continuing worldwide economic pressures. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on delivering excellent performance to our customers, driving improvements and efficiencies across our operations, and creating value through the enhancement and expansion of our business.\nWe continuously evaluate a broad range of options that could be implemented to increase operational efficiency across all sites, and improve our overall market competitiveness. Our decisions will be focused on moving us forward to solidify our leadership in the propulsion markets.\nSome of the significant challenges we face are as follows: dependence upon U.S. government programs and contracts, future reductions or changes in U.S. government spending in our markets, implementation of our CIP, environmental matters, capital structure, and underfunded pension plan.\nMajor Customers\nThe principal end user customers of our products and technology are agencies of the U.S. government. Since a majority of our sales are, directly or indirectly, to the U.S. government, funding for the purchase of our products and services generally follows trends in U.S. aerospace and defense spending. However, individual U.S. government agencies, which include the military services, NASA, the Missile Defense Agency, and the prime contractors that serve these agencies, exercise independent purchasing power within budget top-line\u201d limits. Therefore, sales to the U.S. government are not regarded as sales to one customer, but rather each contracting agency is viewed as a separate customer.\nCustomers that represented more than 10% of net sales for the periods presented are as follows: Table 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lockheed Martin\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Raytheon\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ULA\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NASA\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\n * Less than 10%.  Our sales to each of the major customers listed above involve several product lines and programs.\nSales to the U.S. government and its agencies, including sales to our significant customers discussed above, were as follows (dollars in millions): Table 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Government\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Net\nSales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,529.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>1,478.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2013\n</td> <td>1,305.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Standard Missile program, which is comprised of several contracts and is included in U.S. government sales, represented 14%, 12%, and 22% of net sales for fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. In addition, the THAAD program, which is comprised of several contracts and is included in U.S. government sales, represented 13%, 12%, and 3% of net sales for fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.\nIndustry Update\nOur primary aerospace and defense customers include the DoD and its agencies, NASA, and the prime contractors that supply products to these customers. We are seeing more opportunities for commercial launch and in-space business. In addition, sales to our aerospace and defense customers that provide products to international customers continue to grow. However, we continue to rely on particular levels of U.S. government spending on propulsion systems for defense, space and armament systems, precision tactical weapon systems and munitions applications, and our backlog depends, in large part, on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we are involved. These funding levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but rather follow the cycle of general public policy and political support for this type of funding. Moreover, although our contracts often contemplate that our services will be performed over a period of several years, the U.S. Congress must appropriate funds for a given program and the U.S. President must sign government budget legislation each GFY and may significantly increase, decrease or eliminate, funding for a program. A decrease in DoD and/or NASA expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a material program in which we are or hope to be involved, or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government outlays, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011 established statutory limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, or budgets caps, for both defense and non-defense over the next 10 years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 provided temporary relief to the Budget Control Act of 2011 cap levels in GFY 2014 and 2015 and eased sequestration spending cuts to the DoD and other federal agencies (e.g., NASA) for GFY 2014 and 2015, paving the way for eventual agreements on GFY 2014 and 2015 appropriations for all federal agencies. Similarly, in November 2015, the U.S. President signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, providing another two years of relief to the Budget Control Act cap numbers. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 covers both GFY 2016 and 2017 and allows for increased spending levels for DoD and other U.S. government agencies including NASA. This paved the way for the U.S. Congress to pass and the U.S. President to sign into law a $1.1 trillion Omnibus\u201d appropriations bill for GFY 2016, funding all government agencies. The defense portion of the bill provides $514.1\nbillion in base defense funding and $58.6 billion in overseas contingency operations. The base funding level is $12.8 billion below the GFY 2016 budget request while the overseas contingency operations portion is $7.7 billion above the GFY 2016 budget request. The NASA portion contains a top line of $19.3 billion, a $1.3 billion increase over GFY 2015 level.\nDespite overall U.S. government budget pressures, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from funding in DoD and NASA priority areas. This view reflects the DoD's strategic guidance report released in January 2012, and the 2014 QDR which affirms support for many of our core programs and explicitly states Missile Defense, Space, Nuclear Deterrence, and Precision Strike as key capabilities for the DoD to preserve.\nThe NASA Authorization Act has again identified the SLS program as one of its top priorities in the NASA GFY 2016 budget. The SLS program also has enjoyed wide, bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress. We maintain a strong relationship with NASA and our propulsion systems have been powering NASA launch vehicles and spacecraft since the inception of the U.S. space program. Our booster, upper stage and Orion vehicle propulsion systems are currently baselined on the new SLS vehicle and both upper stage and booster engines are in development for future SLS variants. Due to the retirement of the space shuttle fleet, U.S. astronauts are now dependent on Russian Soyuz flights for access to and from the ISS for the better part of this decade. NASA has been working to re-establish U.S. manned space capability as soon as possible through development of a new space taxi\u201d to ferry astronauts and cargo to the ISS. In 2014, Boeing's CST-100 Starliner capsule, powered by Aerojet Rocketdyne propulsion, was selected by NASA to transport astronauts to and from the ISS. As Boeing's teammate, Aerojet Rocketdyne will be providing the propulsion system for this new vehicle, thereby supplementing its work for NASA on the SLS designed for manned deep space exploration. In both instances, we have significant propulsion content and we look forward to supporting these generational programs for NASA.\nThe competitive dynamics of our multi-faceted marketplace vary by product sector and customer as we experience many of the same influences felt by the broader aerospace and defense industry. The large majority of products we manufacture are highly complex, technically sophisticated and extremely hazardous to build, demanding rigorous manufacturing procedures and highly specialized manufacturing equipment. While historically these factors, coupled with the high cost to establish the infrastructure required to meet these needs, posed substantial barriers to entry, modern design tools and manufacturing techniques (additive manufacturing) available to new entrants with the ability to self-fund start-up as well as development costs has led to increased competition in space related markets. To date, the competition has been limited to a few participants who tend to be narrowly focused on products that are sub-elements of our overall product portfolio. For example, entrepreneurs such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, who have been or are in the process of developing liquid fuel propulsion capabilities are primarily focused on the development of space propulsion systems for heavy lift launch vehicles and are not pursuing or participating in the missile defense or tactical propulsion business segments that make up a substantial portion of our overall business. These new entrepreneurs have signaled their intent to compete primarily on price and are therefore bringing pressure to bear on existing cost paradigms and manufacturing methodologies.\nCompetitive Improvement Program\nIn March 2015, we initiated the CIP comprised of activities and initiatives aimed at reducing costs in order for us to continue to compete successfully. The company-wide initiative is being undertaken after a comprehensive assessment of our product portfolio to underpin Aerojet Rocketdyne's technological and competitive leadership in our markets through continued research and development. The CIP is composed of three major components: (i) facilities optimization and footprint reduction; (ii) product affordability; and (iii) reduced administrative and overhead costs. Under the CIP, we expect an estimated 500 headcount reduction in our total employee population. We currently estimate that we will incur restructuring and related costs over the next four years totaling approximately $110 million. When fully implemented, we anticipate that the CIP will result in annual cost savings of approximately $145 million beginning in fiscal 2019. As a result of this effort, we will be better positioned to deliver our innovative, high quality and reliable products at a lower cost to our customers. The CIP costs will consist primarily of severance and other employee related costs totaling approximately $43 million, operating facility costs totaling approximately $27 million, and $40 million for other costs relating to product re-qualification, knowledge transfer and other CIP implementation costs. A summary of our CIP reserve activity in fiscal 2015 is shown below:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Severance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Retention\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>February 28, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Accrual established\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Payments\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 30, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe costs associated with the CIP will be a component of our U.S. government forward pricing rates, and therefore, will be recovered through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. In addition to the employee-related CIP\nobligations, we incurred non-cash accelerated depreciation expense of $0.8 million in fiscal 2015 associated with changes in the estimated useful life of long-lived assets impacted by the CIP.\nAs part of our ongoing effort to optimize business resources and achieve headcount reduction goals established through the CIP, we offered a Voluntary Reduction in Force (\"VRIF\") in July 2015 to our employees. In connection with the VRIF, we recorded a liability of $2.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, consisting of costs for severance, employee-related benefits and other associated expenses. These costs will be a component of our U.S. government forward pricing rates, and therefore, will be recovered through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government.\nSuccessful implementation of the CIP initiative will directly benefit our ability to win important, new development work thereby advancing our wide range of next generation propulsion solutions including our newest liquid booster engine, the AR1. Here we plan to supplement the benefits from the CIP by continuing to invest in significant company-funded research and development activities toward the successful development of this engine to meet current and future U.S. space launch needs.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur current and former business operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes. Our policy is to conduct our business with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We continually assess compliance with these regulations and we believe our current operations are materially in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.\nA summary of our recoverable amounts, environmental reserves, and range of liability, as of November 30, 2015 is presented below:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Recoverable\nAmount (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Reserve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Range\nof Liability\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerojet Rocketdyne - Sacramento\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$153.0 - $253.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerojet Rocketdyne - BPOU\n</td> <td>108.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140.1 - 183.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Aerojet Rocketdyne sites\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8 - 13.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other sites\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2 - 6.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>234.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>306.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$306.1 - $457.4\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____\n (1) Excludes the receivable from Northrop of $68.7 million as of November 30, 2015 related to environmental costs already paid (and therefore not reserved) by the Company in prior years and reimbursable under the Northrop Agreement.  Most of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these future costs are allowable to be included in our contracts with the U.S. government and allocable to Northrop until the cumulative expenditure limitation is reached. See Note 9(c) and (d) of the notes to consolidated financial statements and \"Environmental Matters\" below for summary of our environmental reserve activity.\nCapital Structure\nWe have a substantial amount of debt for which we are required to make interest and principal payments. Interest on long-term financing is not a recoverable cost under our U.S. government contracts. As of November 30, 2015, we had $652.0 million of debt principal outstanding. The fair value of the debt outstanding at November 30, 2015 was $751.5 million.\nRetirement Benefits\nWe expect to make cash contributions of approximately $23 million to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan in fiscal 2016. We estimate that approximately 83% of our unfunded pension obligation as of November 30, 2015 is related to Aerojet Rocketdyne which will be recoverable through our U.S. government contracts.\nThe funded status of our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan may be adversely affected by the investment experience of the plan's assets, by any changes in U.S. law and by changes in the statutory interest rates used by tax-qualified pension plans in the U.S. to calculate funding requirements. Accordingly, if the performance of our plan's assets does not meet our assumptions, if there are changes to the IRS regulations or other applicable law or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our future contributions to our underfunded pension plans could be higher than we expect.\nAdditionally, the level of returns on retirement benefit assets, changes in interest rates, changes in legislation, and other factors affect our financial results. The timing of recognition of pension expense or income in our financial statements differs from the timing of the required pension funding under PPA or the amount of funding that can be recorded in our overhead rates\nthrough our U.S. government contracting business. Our earnings are positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our employee retirement benefit plans.\nResults of Operations\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td>

The increase in net sales was primarily due to the following: (i) an increase of $84.3 million in space advanced programs primarily driven by the RS-25 program which is currently engaged in a significant development and integration effort in support of the SLS development program and increased development work on the Orion program partially offset by the successful completion of current J-2X program; (ii) an increase of $80.3 million in missile defense and strategic systems programs primarily driven by the increased deliveries on the THAAD and Standard Missile programs; and (iii) sale of approximately 550 acres of our Sacramento Land for $42.0 million. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $109.7 million in space launch programs primarily associated with the RL10 and RS-68 programs as a result of the timing of deliveries and costs incurred on these multi-year contracts and lower sales related to the Antares AJ-26 program close-out (see discussion below).\n** Primary reason for change. The increase in net sales was primarily due to the net sales from the acquired Rocketdyne Business. The Rocketdyne Business generated sales of $681.9 million in fiscal 2014 compared to $311.8 million in fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2014 and 2013 results include 12 months and 51/2 months, respectively, of the acquired Rocketdyne Business. The increase in net sales also included increased deliveries on the AJ60, THAAD, and Orion programs totaling $71.9 million. The increase in net sales was partially offset by (i) a decrease in the various Standard Missile contracts primarily from the transitioning of the Standard Missile-3 Block IB contract from development activities to low-rate initial production, decreased development activities for the TDACS for the Standard Missile-3 Block IIA contract, and the cessation of deliveries on the\nStandard Missile-1 Regrain contract in fiscal 2014 as a result of contract completion; (ii) an additional week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 resulting in $27.8 million in net sales; (iii) lower sales a result of the completion of the T3 IIA and IIB contracts as the program entered the next development phase; and (iv) decreased deliveries and changes in the estimated measurement of progress toward completion on the Antares program.\nCost of Sales (exclusive of items shown separately below):\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change**\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions, except percentage amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales:\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,459.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,406.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,406.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,234.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales\n</td> <td>85.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales excluding retirement benefit expense and step-up in fair value of inventory\n</td> <td>82.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of cost of sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales excluding retirement benefit expense and step-up in fair value of inventory\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,409.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,377.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,377.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,187.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales associated with the Acquisition step-up in fair value of inventory not allocable to our U.S. government contracts\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retirement benefit expense\n</td> <td>50.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,459.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,406.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,406.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,234.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Primary reason for change. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales excluding retirement benefit expense and the step-up in fair value of inventory is primarily due to (i) land sale of approximately 550 acres of Sacramento Land resulting in gross profit of $30.6 million, 1.8% of net sales, and (ii) the close-out of the Antares AJ-26 program. Aerojet Rocketdyne entered into a Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement (the Agreement\u201d) with Orbital Sciences Corporation ( Orbital\u201d) pursuant to which the parties mutually agreed to a termination for convenience of the contract relating to the provision by Aerojet Rocketdyne of 20 AJ-26 liquid propulsion rocket engines to Orbital for the Antares program (the Contract\u201d). The Agreement also settles all claims the parties may have had against one another arising out of the Contract and the launch failure that occurred on October 28, 2014 of an Antares launch vehicle carrying the Cygnus ORB-3 service and cargo module.

The increase in interest expense was partially offset by the 4 1/16% Debentures repurchased during fiscal 2014.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit): Table 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision (benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(198.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the reconciling items between the income tax (benefit) provision using the federal statutory rate and our reported income tax provision (benefit).\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statutory U.S. federal income tax rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State and local income taxes, net of U.S. federal income tax effect\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in state income tax rates\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve adjustments\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Valuation allowance adjustments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(178.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rescindable common stock interest and realized losses (gains)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-deductible convertible subordinated notes interest\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-deductible premiums on repurchase of convertible subordinated notes\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research credits\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retroactive change in federal tax law\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit of manufacturing deductions\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lobbying costs\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision (benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(198.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn fiscal 2015, our effective tax rate was an income tax expense of 1.8% on a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $16.8 million. Our effective tax rate differed from the 35.0% statutory federal income tax rate due largely to state income taxes and certain non-deductible interest expense partially offset by the retroactive reinstatement of the federal R&D credit and the benefit related to manufacturing deductions.\nIn fiscal 2014, our effective tax rate was an income tax expense of 49.4% on a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $33.0 million. Our effective tax rate differed from the 35% statutory federal income tax rate due largely to the non-deductible premiums paid upon the redemption of portions of the convertible debt, state income taxes, impacts from the final research and development credit study, the benefit related to manufacturing deductions, and certain non-deductible interest expense.\nIn fiscal 2013, our effective tax rate was an income tax benefit of 555.7% on a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $35.7 million. Our effective tax rate differed from the 35% statutory federal income tax rate due largely to the release of a significant portion of the valuation allowance previously recorded against deferred tax assets, the impact of state income taxes, and certain non-deductible interest expense. We released $282.4 million of the valuation allowance that existed at the beginning of the year, of which approximately $178.7 million was recorded as an income tax benefit to continuing operations, $1.1 million to discontinued operations, and $102.6 million was recorded in other comprehensive income.\nThe carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. We need $473.6 million in pre-tax income and $409.9 million in other comprehensive income to realize the net deferred tax assets as of November 30, 2015. We project that future taxable income will increase as a result of increased income from continuing operations resulting from improved contract profit margins related to the Rocketdyne acquisition integration and improved margins beginning in fiscal 2015 due to anticipated contributions to our tax qualified defined benefit pension plan, which are recoverable through our U.S. government contracts. These increases in income from continuing operations will be partially offset by book to tax adjustments, primarily related to retirement benefit plan payments, state tax deductions, and our manufacturing deductions.\nThe timing of recording or releasing a valuation allowance requires significant management judgment. The amount of the valuation allowance released by us represents a portion of deferred tax assets that was deemed more-likely-than-not that we will realize the benefits based on the analysis in which the positive evidence outweighed the negative evidence.\nA valuation allowance is required when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized. Establishment and removal of a valuation allowance requires management to consider all positive and negative evidence and make a judgmental decision regarding the amount of valuation allowance required as of a reporting date. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. In the evaluation as of November 30, 2015 and 2014, management has considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to the following:\nPositive evidence\n \u2022 The three year comprehensive cumulative income position as of November 30, 2015; \n \u2022 Our recent history of generating taxable income which has allowed for the utilization of tax credit carryforwards, and the expected taxable income position for the current year; \n \u2022 Pension rules that allow us to recover pension funding cash contributions through our U.S. government contracts; \n \u2022 Continuing positive results of operations from the acquisition of the Rocketdyne Business; \n \u2022 Establishment and execution of the Competitive Improvement Program evidencing increasing growth and profitability; \n \u2022 Increase in our contract backlog; and \n \u2022 Favorable trends with respect to the market value of certain real estate assets.  Negative evidence\n \u2022 Our exposure to environmental remediation obligations and the related uncertainty as to the ultimate exposure upon settlement; \n \u2022 The significance of our defined benefit pension obligation and related impact it could have in future years; \n \u2022 The additional indebtedness incurred in fiscal 2013 related to the acquisition of the Rocketdyne Business that continues to generate interest expense; and \n \u2022 Potential three-year cumulative loss position at the end of fiscal 2016.  During fiscal 2015 and 2014, we continued to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance and have concluded in each quarter, including year end, that the amount of valuation allowance currently recorded was appropriate. We will continue to evaluate the ability to realize our net deferred tax assets to determine if an increase to our valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nThe Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 passed in December 2015, retroactively reinstating the federal R&D credit and \"bonus\" depreciation. As a result, we expect to record an estimated benefit to our income tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 of approximately $2.7 million related to the R&D credit. The impact of the additional tax depreciation will reduce our income taxes payable and long-term deferred tax assets by approximately $3 million.\nRetirement Benefit Plans:\nComponents of retirement benefit expense are: Table 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service cost\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest cost on benefit obligation\n</td> <td>65.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumed return on plan assets\n</td> <td>(88.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(96.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of prior service credits\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of net losses\n</td> <td>80.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in retirement benefit expense in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to higher actuarial losses arising from the November 30, 2014 measurement associated with the updated mortality assumption and a decrease in the discount rate used to determine our retirement benefit plans' obligations at November 30, 2014. The discount rate was 3.96% as of November 30, 2014 compared to 4.54% as of November 30, 2013.\nWe estimate that our non-cash retirement benefit expense will be approximately $67 million in fiscal 2016.\nMarket conditions and interest rates significantly affect the assets and liabilities of our pension plans. Pension accounting permits market gains and losses to be deferred and recognized over a period of years. This smoothing\u201d results in the creation of other accumulated income or losses which will be amortized to retirement benefit expense or benefit in future years. The accounting method we utilize recognizes one-fifth of the unamortized gains and losses associated with the market-related value of pension assets and all other gains and losses, including changes in the discount rate used to calculate benefit costs each year. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return and the actual return on the market-related value of assets which smoothes market related asset values over three years. Although the smoothing period mitigates some volatility in the calculation of annual retirement benefit expense, future expenses are impacted by changes in the market value of pension plan assets and changes in interest rates.\nAdditionally, we sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan and participation in the plan is available to substantially all employees. Our contributions to the 401(k) plan were $24.9 million in fiscal 2015, $24.4 million in fiscal 2014, and $14.7 million in fiscal 2013. The cost is recoverable through our overhead rates on our U.S. government contracts.\nOperating Segment Information:\nWe evaluate our operating segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment performance. Segment performance, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, represents net sales from continuing operations less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for unusual items relating to the segment. Excluded from segment performance are: corporate income and expenses, interest expense, interest income, income taxes, legacy income or expenses, and unusual items not related to the segment. We believe that segment performance provides information useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance. In addition, we provide the Non-GAAP financial measure of our operational performance called segment performance before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefit expense, Rocketdyne purchase accounting adjustments, and unusual items. We believe the exclusion of the items listed above permits an evaluation and a comparison of results for ongoing business operations, and it is on this basis that management internally assesses operational performance.\nAerospace and Defense Segment\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change**\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Restated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions, except percentage amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,660.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,596.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,596.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,372.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>223.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment performance (Non-GAAP measure)\n</td> <td>48.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment margin (Non-GAAP measure)\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment margin before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefit expense, Rocketdyne purchase accounting adjustments, and unusual items (Non-GAAP measure)\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of segment performance:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerospace and Defense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.7\n</td>"}
