MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nLions Gate Entertainment Corp. (the Company,\u201d Lionsgate,\u201d \"Lions Gate,\" we,\u201d us\u201d or our\u201d) is a vertically integrated next generation global content leader with a diversified presence in motion picture production and distribution, television programming and syndication, premium pay television networks, home entertainment, global distribution and sales, interactive ventures and games and location-based entertainment. We classify our operations through three reporting segments: Motion Pictures, Television Production, and Media Networks (see further discussion below).\nStarz Merger\nOn December 8, 2016, upon shareholder approval, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 30, 2016 (\"Merger Agreement\"), Lionsgate and Starz consummated a merger, under which Lionsgate acquired Starz for a combination of cash and common stock (the \"Starz Merger\"). See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further details of the Starz Merger.\nFollowing the Starz Merger, beginning in the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the Company reorganized its segment structure and now manages and reports its operating results through three reportable business segments: Motion Pictures, Television Production and Media Networks (Media Networks was not a reportable segment prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2016). As a result of the Starz Merger, beginning December 8, 2016, the Motion Pictures segment includes Starz's third-party distribution business. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for our segment information disclosure.\nRevenues\nOur revenues are derived from the Motion Pictures, Television Production and Media Networks segments, as described below. Our revenues are derived from the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and other foreign countries. None of the non-U.S. countries individually comprised greater than 10% of total revenues for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nMotion Pictures\nOur Motion Pictures segment includes revenues derived from the following:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Theatrical. Theatrical revenues are derived from the domestic theatrical release of motion pictures licensed to theatrical exhibitors on a picture-by-picture basis (distributed by us directly in the U.S. and through a sub-distributor in Canada). The revenues from Canada are reported net of distribution fees and release expenses of the Canadian sub-distributor. The financial terms that we negotiate with our theatrical exhibitors in the U.S. generally provide that we receive a percentage of the box office results and are negotiated on a picture-by-picture basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Home Entertainment. Home entertainment revenues are derived from the sale or rental of our film productions and acquired or licensed films and certain television programs (including theatrical and direct-to-video releases) on packaged media and through digital media platforms. In addition, we have revenue sharing arrangements with certain digital media platforms which generally provide that, in exchange for a nominal or no upfront sales price, we share in the rental or sales revenues generated by the platform on a title-by-title basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Television. Television revenues are primarily derived from the licensing of our theatrical productions and acquired films to the linear pay, basic cable and free television markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>International. International revenues are derived from the licensing from our international subsidiaries of our productions, acquired films, our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles to international distributors, on a territory-by-territory basis. International revenues also include revenues from the direct distribution of our productions, acquired films, and our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles in the United Kingdom.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Other. Other revenues are derived from, among others, our interactive ventures and games division, our global franchise management and strategic partnerships division (which includes location-based entertainment), the sales and licensing of music from the theatrical exhibition of our films and the television broadcast of our productions, and from the licensing of our film and television content to ancillary markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTelevision Production\nOur Television Production segment includes revenues derived from the following:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Domestic Television. Domestic television revenues are derived from the licensing and syndication to domestic markets of scripted and unscripted series, television movies, mini-series and non-fiction programming.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>International. International revenues are derived from the licensing and syndication to international markets of scripted and unscripted series, television movies, mini-series and non-fiction programming.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Home Entertainment.

Other revenues are derived from, among others, product integration in our television episodes and programs, the sales and licensing of music from the television broadcasts of our productions, and from the licensing of our television programs to ancillary markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Media Networks\nOur Media Networks segment includes revenues derived from the following:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Starz Networks. Starz Networks' revenues are derived from the distribution of our STARZ branded premium subscription video services pursuant to affiliation agreements with U.S. multichannel video programming distributors ( MVPDs\u201d), including cable operators, satellite television providers and telecommunications companies, and over-the-top (\"OTT\") providers (collectively, Distributors\u201d), and on a direct-to-consumer basis. Starz Networks' revenue is recognized in the period during which programming is provided, either: (i) based solely on the total number of subscribers who receive our services multiplied by rates specified in the affiliation agreements; (ii) based on amounts or rates specified in the affiliation agreements which are not tied solely to the total number of subscribers who receive our services, or (iii) the total number of subscribers who receive our direct-to-consumer service multiplied by the applicable retail rate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Content and Other. Original content revenues are derived from the licensing of Starz original programming to digital media platforms, international television networks, through packaged media and other ancillary markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Streaming Services. Streaming services revenues are derived from the Lionsgate legacy start-up direct to consumer streaming services on subscription video-on-demand (\"SVOD\") platforms.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Expenses\nOur primary operating expenses include direct operating expenses, distribution and marketing expenses and general and administration expenses.\nDirect operating expenses include amortization of film and television production or acquisition costs, amortization of programming production or acquisition costs and programming related salaries, participation and residual expenses, provision for doubtful accounts, and foreign exchange gains and losses.\nParticipation costs represent contingent consideration payable based on the performance of the film or television program to parties associated with the film or television program, including producers, writers, directors or actors. Residuals represent amounts payable to various unions or guilds\u201d such as the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, Directors Guild of America, and Writers Guild of America, based on the performance of the film or television program in certain ancillary markets or based on the individual's (i.e., actor, director, writer) salary level in the television market.\nDistribution and marketing expenses primarily include the costs of theatrical prints and advertising ( P&A\u201d) and of DVD/Blu-ray duplication and marketing. Theatrical P&A includes the costs of the theatrical prints delivered to theatrical exhibitors and the advertising and marketing cost associated with the theatrical release of the picture. DVD/Blu-ray duplication represents the cost of the DVD/Blu-ray product and the manufacturing costs associated with creating the physical products. DVD/Blu-ray marketing costs represent the cost of advertising the product at or near the time of its release or special promotional advertising. Marketing costs for Media Networks includes advertising, consumer marketing, distributor marketing support and other marketing costs. In addition, distribution and marketing costs includes our Media Networks segment operating costs for the direct-to-consumer service, transponder expenses and maintenance and repairs.\nGeneral and administration expenses include salaries and other overhead.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. As described more fully below, these estimates bear the risk of change due to the inherent uncertainty of the estimate. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. For a summary of all of our accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting for Films and Television Programs and Program Rights. We capitalize costs of production and acquisition, including financing costs and production overhead, to investment in films and television programs. These costs for an individual film or television program are amortized and participation and residual costs are accrued to direct operating expenses in the proportion that current year's revenues bear to management's estimates of the ultimate revenue at the beginning of the current year expected to be recognized from the exploitation, exhibition or sale of such film or television program. Ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed ten years following the date of initial release of the motion picture. For an episodic television series, the period over which ultimate revenues are estimated cannot exceed ten years following the date of delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production, five years from the date of delivery of the most recent episode, if later. For previously released film or television programs acquired as part of a library, ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed twenty years from the date of acquisition.\nDue to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates of ultimate revenues and expenses, these estimates have differed in the past from actual results and are likely to differ to some extent in the future from actual results. In addition, in the normal course of our business, some films and titles are more successful or less successful than anticipated. Management regularly reviews and revises when necessary its ultimate revenue and cost estimates, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization of film costs and participations and residuals and/or write-down of all or a portion of the unamortized costs of the film or television program to its estimated fair value. Management estimates the ultimate revenue based on experience with similar titles or title genre, the general public appeal of the cast, actual performance (when available) at the box office or in markets currently being exploited, and other factors such as the quality and acceptance of motion pictures or programs that our competitors release into the marketplace at or near the same time, critical reviews, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, many of which we do not control and which may change.\nAn increase in the estimate of ultimate revenue will generally result in a lower amortization rate and, therefore, less film and television program amortization expense, while a decrease in the estimate of ultimate revenue will generally result in a higher amortization rate and, therefore, higher film and television program amortization expense, and also periodically results in an impairment requiring a write-down of the film cost to the title's fair value. These write-downs are included in amortization expense within direct operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Investment in films and television programs is stated at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value. The valuation of investment in films and television programs is reviewed on a title-by-title basis, when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a film or television program is less than its unamortized cost. In determining the fair value of our films and television programs, we employ a discounted cash flows (\"DCF\") methodology with assumptions for cash flows. Key inputs employed in the DCF methodology include estimates of a film's ultimate revenue and costs as well as a discount rate. The discount rate utilized in the DCF analysis is based on our weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium representing the risk associated with producing a particular film or television program. The fair value of any film costs associated with a film or television program that we plan to abandon is zero. As the primary determination of fair value is determined using a DCF model, the resulting fair value is considered a Level 3 measurement (as defined in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements). Additional amortization is recorded in the amount by which the unamortized costs exceed the estimated fair value of the film or television program. Estimates of future revenue involve measurement uncertainty and it is therefore possible that reductions in the carrying value of investment in films and television programs may be required as a consequence of changes in our future revenue estimates.\nProgram rights for films and television programs (including original series) exhibited by the Media Networks segment are generally amortized on a title-by-title or episode-by-episode basis over the anticipated number of exhibitions or license period. We estimate the number of exhibitions based on the number of exhibitions allowed in the agreement and the expected usage of the content. Certain other program rights are amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the respective lives of the\nagreements. Programming rights may include rights to more than one exploitation windows under its output and library agreements. For films with multiple windows, the license fee is allocated between the windows based upon the proportionate estimated fair value of each window which generally results in the majority of the cost allocated to the first window on newer releases. Programming costs vary due to the number of airings and cost of our original series, the number of films licensed and the cost per film paid under our output and library programming agreements.\nThe cost of the Media Networks' segment original content is allocated between the pay television market and the ancillary revenue markets (e.g., home video, digital platforms, international television, etc.) based on the estimated relative fair values of these markets. The amount associated with the pay television market is reclassified to program rights when the program is aired and the portion attributable to the ancillary markets remains in investment in films and television programs. Costs allocated to the pay television market are amortized to expense over the anticipated number of exhibitions for each original series while costs associated with the ancillary revenue markets are amortized to expense based on the proportion that current revenue from the original series bears to its ultimate revenue. Estimates of fair value for the pay television and ancillary markets involve uncertainty as well as estimates of ultimate revenue. All the costs of programming produced by the Media Networks segment and included in investment in films and television programs and program rights, net are classified as long term. Amounts included in program rights, other than internally produced programming, that are expected to be amortized within a year from the balance sheet date are classified as short-term.\nChanges in management's estimate of the anticipated exhibitions of films and original series on our networks could result in the earlier recognition of our programming costs than anticipated. Conversely, scheduled exhibitions may not capture the appropriate usage of the program rights in current periods which would lead to the write-off of additional program rights in future periods and may have a significant impact on our future results of operations and our financial position.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue from the theatrical release of feature films is recognized at the time of exhibition based on our participation in box office receipts. Revenue from the sale of DVDs and Blu-ray discs in the retail market, net of an allowance for estimated returns and other allowances, is recognized on the later of receipt by the customer or street date\u201d (when it is available for sale by the customer). Under revenue sharing arrangements, including digital and EST arrangements, such as download-to-own, download-to-rent, video-on-demand, and subscription video-on-demand, revenue is recognized when we are entitled to receipts and such receipts are determinable. Revenues from television or digital licensing for fixed fees are recognized when the feature film or television program is available to the licensee for telecast. For television licenses that include separate availability windows\u201d during the license period, revenue is allocated to the windows\u201d of availability in the arrangement. Revenue from sales to international territories are recognized when access to the feature film or television program has been granted or delivery has occurred, as required under the contract, and the right to exploit the feature film or television program has commenced. For multiple media rights contracts with a fee for a single film or television program where the contract provides for media holdbacks (defined as contractual media release restrictions), the fee is allocated to the various media based on our assessment of the relative fair value of the rights to exploit each media and is recognized as each holdback is released. For multiple-title contracts with a fee, the fee is allocated on a title-by-title basis, based on our assessment of the relative fair value of each title.\nProgramming revenue is recognized in the period during which programming is provided, pursuant to affiliation agreements. If an affiliation agreement has expired and our programming is continuing to be aired by the Distributor, revenue is recognized based on the terms of the expired agreement or the actual payment from the distributor, whichever is less. Payments to distributors for marketing support costs for which Starz does not receive a direct benefit are recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nSales Returns Allowance. Revenues are recorded net of estimated returns and other allowances. We estimate reserves for DVD/Blu-ray returns based on previous returns experience, point-of-sale data available from certain retailers, current economic trends, and projected future sales of the title to the consumer based on the actual performance of similar titles on a title-by-title basis in each of the DVD/Blu-ray businesses. Factors affecting actual returns include, among other factors, limited retail shelf space at various times of the year, success of advertising or other sales promotions, and the near term release of competing titles. We believe that our estimates have been materially accurate in the past; however, due to the judgment involved in establishing reserves, we may have adjustments to our historical estimates in the future. Our estimate of future returns affects reported revenue and operating income. If we underestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amounts. If we overestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record additional revenue in later periods when returns are less than estimated. An incremental change of 1% in our estimated sales returns rate (i.e., provisions for returns divided by gross sales of related product) for home entertainment products would have had an impact of approximately $6.0 million, $7.1 million and $5.4 million on our total revenue in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nProvisions for Accounts Receivable. We estimate provisions for accounts receivable based on historical experience and relevant facts and information regarding the collectability of the accounts receivable. In performing this evaluation, significant judgments and estimates are involved, including an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for our larger customers and an analysis of the length of time receivables have been past due. The financial condition of a given customer and its ability to pay may change over time or could be better or worse than anticipated and could result in an increase or decrease to our allowance for doubtful accounts, which is recorded in direct operating expenses.\nIncome Taxes. We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the U.S., and in several foreign jurisdictions. We record deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences, net of applicable reserves in these jurisdictions. We recognize a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis; otherwise a valuation allowance is applied. In order to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets, we will need to generate sufficient taxable income in the future in each of the jurisdictions which have these deferred tax assets. However, the assessment as to whether there will be sufficient taxable income in a jurisdiction to realize our net deferred tax assets in that jurisdiction is an estimate which could change in the future depending primarily upon the actual performance of our Company. We will be required to continually evaluate the more likely than not assessment that our net deferred tax assets will be realized, and if operating results deteriorate in a particular jurisdiction, we may need to record a valuation allowance for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets through a charge to our income tax provision. Based on our assessment in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we recorded a valuation allowance of $68.2 million against certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets that may not be realized on a more likely than not basis.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was signed into law, making significant changes to the taxation of U.S. business entities. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed a one-time transition tax in connection with the move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, provided for accelerated deductions for certain U.S. film production costs, imposed limitations on certain tax deductions such as executive compensation in future periods, and included numerous other provisions. We are currently in the process of evaluating the full impact of the Tax Act on our financial statements and have not completed this evaluation. We have reported provisional amounts reflecting our reasonable estimates of the impact of the Tax Act. The estimated impact of the Tax Act is based on a preliminary review of the new law and is subject to revision based upon further analysis and interpretation of the Tax Act.\nOur effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate and are affected by many factors, including the overall level of pre-tax income, mix of our pre-tax income generated across the various jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in tax laws and regulations in those jurisdictions, further interpretation and legislative guidance regarding the new Tax Act, changes in valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, tax planning strategies available to us and other discrete items.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment each fiscal year or between the annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We perform our annual impairment test as of January 1 in each fiscal year. We performed our last annual impairment test on our goodwill as of January 1, 2018 by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there was a potential goodwill impairment. Based on our qualitative assessments, including but not limited to, the results of our most recent quantitative impairment test, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cash flows, and changes in our share price, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value.\nConsolidation. We consolidate entities in which we own more than 50% of the voting common stock and control operations and also variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. Investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own more than 20% of the voting common stock or otherwise exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but not control of the nonconsolidated affiliate, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own less than 20% of the voting common stock are accounted for using the cost method of accounting.\nBusiness Combinations. We account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value. Goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired, net of assumed liabilities. Determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives among other items.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Due to the Starz Merger, fiscal 2017 includes the results of operations from Starz from the acquisition date of December 8, 2016. Revenue from Starz across all segments was $1.65 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $483.2 million for the period from the acquisition date of December 8, 2016 to March 31, 2017.\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Consolidated revenues increased in fiscal 2018, due to the inclusion of Starz revenue for the entire fiscal year, as compared to the period from the acquisition date of December 8, 2016 to March 31, 2017 in fiscal 2017, offset partially by decreases in Motion Pictures revenues and, to a lesser extent, Television Production revenues. The Media Networks and Motion Pictures revenues in fiscal 2018 include $1,525.4 million and $126.4 million, respectively, of revenues from Starz, as compared to $453.7 million and $29.5 million, respectively, in fiscal 2017 from the date of acquisition.\nThe decrease in Motion Pictures revenue was primarily due to decreases in theatrical and international revenue driven by our smaller theatrical slate (15 feature films released in fiscal 2018 compared to 18 in fiscal 2017). In addition, fiscal 2017 included significant theatrical and international contributions from La La Land, Now You See Me 2 and Deepwater Horizon. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in Motion Pictures home entertainment revenue, driven by a greater contribution in fiscal 2018 from the Starz third party distribution business as a result of the Starz Merger.\nA significant component of revenue comes from home entertainment.

See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail of these transactions.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $40.4 million in fiscal 2017 related to the extinguishment of debt in connection with the Starz Merger financing in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and the early repayment of $400.0 million in principal amount on the Previous Term Loan B in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nGain on Sale of Equity Interest in EPIX.

During fiscal 2018, we recognized $29.2 million of other-than-temporary impairments on our investments and notes receivable (included in other assets), which were written down to their estimated fair value (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements).

We had an income tax benefit of $319.4 million in fiscal 2018, compared to a benefit of $148.9 million in fiscal 2017. Our income tax benefit differs from the federal statutory rate multiplied by pre-tax income (loss) due to the mix of our pre-tax income (loss) generated across the various jurisdictions in which we operate and the tax deductions generated by our capital structure, which includes a favorable permanent book-tax difference in our Canadian jurisdiction for certain foreign affiliate dividends. Canadian tax law permits such dividends to be received without being subject to tax. In addition, our total income tax benefit of $319.4 million in fiscal 2018 includes a net benefit of $259.1 million, consisting of a $165.0 million benefit from the impact of the change in U.S. federal tax rates (see below) on our beginning net deferred tax liability balances, a benefit of $162.3 million primarily for foreign affiliate dividends resulting from an internal capital restructuring in connection with our third party debt refinancing (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements), offset by charges of $58.8 million and $9.4 million from increases in our valuation allowance associated with certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, respectively, that may not be realized on a more likely than not basis. The impact is reflected in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in the table that reconciles income taxes computed at U.S. statutory income tax rates to the income tax provision (benefit).\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was signed into law, making significant changes to the taxation of U.S. business entities. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed a one-time transition tax in connection with the move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, changed the ability to claim certain tax deductions, and included numerous other provisions. As we have a March 31 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 31.5% for our fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, and 21% for subsequent fiscal years. Since we are not in a current U.S federal tax paying position for fiscal 2018, our U.S. tax provision consists primarily of deferred tax benefits calculated at the 21% tax rate. Due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, we recorded a $165.0 million income tax benefit from the reduction of our beginning net U.S. deferred tax liabilities in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, which was considered a provisional amount based on reasonable estimates.\nWe have also made provisional estimates of other effects of the Tax Act, such as the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to executive compensation, the one-time transition tax, net operating loss carryovers, foreign tax credits, and accelerated deductions for U.S. film costs. We are currently in the process of evaluating the full impact of the Tax Act on our financial statements and have not completed this evaluation. We have reported provisional amounts reflecting our reasonable estimates of the impact of the Tax Act. The estimated impact of the Tax Act is based on a preliminary review of the new law and is subject to revision based upon further analysis and interpretation of the Tax Act. We will complete our accounting for the Tax Act once we have obtained, prepared, and analyzed all information needed (including computations) for our analysis, but no later than one year from the enactment date of the Tax Act.\nAt March 31, 2018, we had U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1,260.5 million available to reduce\nfuture federal income taxes which expire beginning in 2029 through 2038, state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $712.8 million available to reduce future state income taxes which expire in varying amounts beginning 2021, and Canadian loss carryforwards of $132.5 million, which will expire beginning in 2034. In addition, at March 31, 2018, we had U.S. credit carryforwards related to foreign taxes paid of approximately $68.3 million to offset future federal income taxes that will expire beginning in 2021.\nNet Income Attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Shareholders. Net income attributable to our shareholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 was $473.6 million, or basic net income per common share of $2.27 on 208.4 million weighted average common shares outstanding and diluted net income per common share of $2.15 on 220.4 million weighted average common shares outstanding. This compares to net income attributable to our shareholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 of $14.8 million, or basic net income per common share of $0.09 on 165.0 million weighted average common shares outstanding and diluted net income per common share of $0.09 on 172.2 million weighted average common shares outstanding.\nSegment Results of Operations\nThe segment results of operations presented below do not include the elimination of intersegment transactions which are eliminated when presenting consolidated results, and exclude items separately identified in the restructuring and other line item in the consolidated statement of operations.\nMotion Pictures\nThe table below sets forth Motion Pictures gross contribution and segment profit for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Motion Pictures Segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,822.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,920.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(98.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense\n</td> <td>977.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>976.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution & marketing expense\n</td> <td>551.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>706.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(154.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution\n</td> <td>292.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>237.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>113.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. theatrical P&A expense included in distribution and marketing expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>319.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>474.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(155.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>53.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>16.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue.

The increase in home entertainment revenue from Other Than Feature Film was driven by increased revenue from the Starz third party distribution business in fiscal 2018 (increase of $91.4 million as compared to fiscal 2017). The decrease in home entertainment revenue from our Feature Films was driven by lower packaged media revenue in fiscal 2018 from the smaller Fiscal 2018 theatrical slate, as compared to the packaged media revenue in fiscal 2017 from the Fiscal 2017 theatrical slate, partially offset by higher digital media revenue in fiscal 2018 from our Fiscal 2017 theatrical slate.\nInternational motion pictures revenue decreased $77.1 million, or 14.4%, in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, driven by our smaller Fiscal 2018 theatrical slate, and significant contributions in fiscal 2017 from Now You See Me 2 and Deepwater Horizon.\nDirect Operating Expense. The increase in direct operating expenses as a percentage of motion pictures revenue was primarily driven by the change in the mix of titles and product categories generating revenue in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, and an increase in investment in film write-downs. Included in Motion Pictures direct operating expenses are investment in film write-downs of approximately $33.6 million in fiscal 2018, compared to approximately $17.0 million in fiscal 2017.\nDistribution and Marketing Expense. The decrease in distribution and marketing expense in fiscal 2018 is primarily due to lower theatrical P&A, driven by lower P&A spending in fiscal 2018 on fewer Feature Film theatrical releases. In fiscal 2018, approximately $10.3 million of P&A was incurred in advance for films to be released in fiscal 2019, such as Uncle Drew, Traffik and The Spy Who Dumped Me. In fiscal 2017, approximately $1.9 million of P&A was incurred in advance for films to be released in fiscal 2018, such as All Eyez on Me, How to Be a Latin Lover and American Assassin.\nGross Contribution. Gross contribution and gross contribution margin of the Motion Pictures segment for fiscal 2018 increased as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to lower U.S. theatrical P&A as a percentage of Motion Pictures revenue due to lower P&A spending on the fewer number of Feature Film releases in the current fiscal year, offset partially by higher direct operating expenses as a percentage of Motion Pictures revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses of the Motion Pictures segment increased $7.9 million, or 7.5%, primarily due to increases in salaries and related expenses and incentive compensation.\nTelevision Production\nThe table below sets forth Television Production gross contribution and segment profit for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Television Production Segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>805.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>837.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense\n</td> <td>668.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>711.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution & marketing expense\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution\n</td> <td>107.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>40.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>83.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue.

Domestic television revenue decreased slightly in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to lower domestic television license fees on new scripted television programs, partially offset by an increase of $13.8 million in revenues associated with the fees earned from the distribution in ancillary markets of Starz Original Series.\nInternational revenue in fiscal 2018 decreased $14.0 million, or 9.4%, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily driven by revenue in fiscal 2017 from Orange Is the New Black Seasons 4 & 5 and Mad Men Seasons 1 to 7, which compared to revenue in fiscal 2018 from Orange Is the New Black Season 6, and Step Up: High Water Season 1.\nHome entertainment revenue in fiscal 2018 decreased $9.7 million, or 24.3%, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily driven by lower digital revenue due to a significant contribution from Guilt Season 1 in fiscal 2017. The decrease was also, to a lesser extent, due to lower packaged media revenue.\nDirect Operating Expense. The decrease in direct operating expenses as a percentage of television production revenue is primarily due to the fees associated with the distribution in ancillary markets of Starz Original Series, which have no corresponding direct operating cost in the Television Production segment, and to a lesser extent, was also driven by the mix of titles generating revenue in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.\nGross Contribution. Gross contribution and gross contribution margin of the Television Production segment for fiscal 2018 increased as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to lower direct operating expenses as a percentage of television production revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses of the Television Production segment increased $8.2 million, or 25.5%, primarily due to increases in salaries and related expenses, incentive compensation and general and administrative expenses associated with the distribution of Starz Originals.\nMedia Networks\nThe table below sets forth Media Networks gross contribution and segment profit for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.

Starz Networks' direct operating and distribution and marketing expenses primarily represent programming cost amortization and advertising and marketing costs. The level of programing cost amortization and advertising and marketing costs and thus the gross contribution margin for the Media Networks segment can fluctuate from period to period depending on the number of new shows and particularly new original series premiering on the network during the period. Programming cost amortization and advertising and marketing costs generally increase in periods where new original series are premiering on STARZ. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, the following original series premiered on STARZ: The White Princess (premiere date of April 16, 2017), American Gods Season 1 (premiere date of April 30, 2017), Power Season 4 (premiere date of June 25, 2017), Survivor's Remorse Season 4 (premiere date of August 20, 2017), Outlander Season 3 (premiere date of September 10, 2017), and The Girlfriend Experience Season 2 (premiere date of November 5, 2017), Counterpart Season 1 (premiere date of January 21, 2018) Ash Vs. Evil Dead Season 3 (premiere date of February 25, 2018). During the period from December 8, 2016 through March 31, 2017, the original series, Black Sails (Season 4) (premiere date of January 29, 2017) and The Missing (Season 2) (premiere date of February 12, 2017), premiered on STARZ.\nGross Contribution. Gross contribution of the Media Networks segment for fiscal 2018 was primarily from Starz Networks.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses of the Media Networks segment in fiscal 2018 of $100.9 million represent general and administrative expenses associated with Starz Networks and Streaming Services. In fiscal 2017, general and administrative expenses of $45.0 million represent general and administrative expenses associated with Starz Networks from the acquisition date of December 8, 2016 to March 31, 2017, and general and administrative expenses from Streaming Services.\nMedia Networks Supplemental Pro Forma Financial Information:\nThe following table sets forth the Media Networks segment profit on a pro forma basis as if the Starz Merger and our segment reorganization (see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements) occurred on April 1, 2016:\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media Networks Segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,532.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,458.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense\n</td> <td>628.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>686.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution & marketing expense\n</td> <td>333.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution\n</td> <td>570.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>569.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>100.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>469.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>447.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>41.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>37.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNOTE: The pro forma amounts above were determined by combining the historical financial information of Lionsgate and Starz for each respective period, applying the new Lionsgate segment structure (see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements), and applying the acquisition related accounting.

On a pro forma basis, Starz Networks revenue represented 92% and 94% of Media Networks revenue for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in pro forma Starz Networks revenue was due to a $52.1 million increase due to higher effective rates primarily driven by OTT revenue growth, partially offset by a $22.8 million decrease due to lower average subscriptions related to subscriber losses at certain MVPDs. During fiscal 2018, the original series The White Princess, American Gods Season 1, Power Season 4, Survivor's Remorse Season 4, Outlander Season 3, The Girlfriend Experience Season 2, Counterpart Season 1 and Ash Vs.

During fiscal 2017, the original series Outlander Season 2, The Girlfriend Experience Season 1, Power Season 3, Survivor's Remorse Season 3, Ash vs. Evil Dead Season 2 Blunt Talk Season 2, Black Sails Season 4 and The Missing Season 2 premiered on STARZ.\nThe increase in pro forma Content and Other revenue was driven by a significant contribution of revenues from domestic and worldwide digital media licensing arrangements in fiscal 2018 primarily for the Starz Original Series Power Seasons 1 - 4, The Girlfriend Experience Season 2, Ash Vs. Evil Dead Seasons 1 - 3, Black Sails Season 4, and The White Princess.\nDirect Operating and Distribution and Marketing Expense. The decrease in pro forma direct operating expense is primarily due to lower costs for Starz Networks, driven by decreased programming cost amortization related to output licensing arrangements and Starz Originals, partially offset by an increase in programming cost amortization related to library content and higher development costs. In addition, pro forma direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue for Content and Other decreased due to increased revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in direct operating expense for Streaming Services.\nThe increase in pro forma distribution and marketing expense is due to an increase in Starz Networks' advertising and marketing costs associated with the STARZ app and increased spend on Starz Originals, and to a lesser extent, due to an increase in distribution and marketing expense for Content and Other and Streaming Services.\nGross Contribution. On a pro forma basis, gross contribution of the Media Networks segment for fiscal 2018 was primarily from Starz Networks. The pro forma slight increase in gross contribution is driven by higher gross contribution from Content and Other, which was mostly offset by a decrease in gross contribution from Starz Networks and Streaming Services.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. Pro forma general and administrative expenses of the Media Networks segment in fiscal 2018 decreased due to lower Starz Networks general and administrative expenses primarily attributable to lower payroll and related expenses due to prior year headcount reductions, and a slight decrease in costs associated with Streaming Services.\nFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The results of operations below include the results of Starz from its acquisition date of December 8, 2016 onwards, and Pilgrim Media Group from its acquisition date of November 12, 2015 onwards. Revenue from Starz across all segments was $483.2 million in fiscal 2017, with no comparable revenue in fiscal 2016. Revenue from Pilgrim Media Group was $136.6 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $52.5 million in fiscal 2016.\nMedia Networks was not previously a reportable segment prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2016, and amounts in fiscal 2016 represent the Lionsgate legacy start-up direct to consumer streaming services on SVOD platforms (Streaming Services).\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td>

Consolidated revenues increased in fiscal 2017, due to the inclusion of revenue from the Starz Merger from the date of acquisition (December 8, 2016), an increase in Motion Pictures revenues, and an increase in Television Production revenues (which included revenues in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 of $136.6 million and $52.5 million, respectively, from Pilgrim Media Group, acquired November 12, 2015). The Media Networks and Motion Pictures revenues in fiscal 2017 include $453.7 million and $29.5 million, respectively, of revenues from Starz from the date of acquisition.\nThe increase in Motion Pictures revenue was primarily due to higher home entertainment, television and theatrical revenues driven by a larger theatrical slate (18 feature films released in fiscal 2017 compared to 14 in fiscal 2016), offset partially by lower international revenues as compared to fiscal 2016, which included the release of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2. The increase in Television Production revenues was primarily driven by higher domestic television revenue.

The following table reconciles this amount to total share-based compensation expense:\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation expense by expense category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment and corporate general and administrative expense(1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other(2)\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution and marketing expense\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total share-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________\n(1)Represents immediately vested stock awards granted as part of our annual bonus program issued in lieu of cash bonuses, which is, when granted, included in segment or corporate general and administrative expenses.\n(2)Represents share-based compensation expense included in restructuring and other expenses reflecting the impact of the acceleration of certain vesting schedules for equity awards pursuant to certain severance arrangements.\nPurchase accounting and related adjustments represent the charge for the accretion of the noncontrolling interest discount related to Pilgrim Media Group that is included in general and administrative expense (see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements).\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization of $63.1 million for fiscal 2017 increased $50.0 million from $13.1 million in fiscal 2016. The increase is primarily due to the depreciation and amortization associated with the property and equipment and intangible assets related to the Starz acquisition.\nRestructuring and Other.

We had an income tax benefit of $148.9 million in fiscal 2017, compared to a benefit of $76.5 million in fiscal 2016. Our income tax benefit differs from the federal statutory rate multiplied by pre-tax income (loss) and has changed from fiscal 2016. Our income tax benefit is affected by many factors, including the overall level of pre-tax income, the mix of pre-tax income generated across the various jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in tax laws and regulations in those jurisdictions, changes in valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, tax planning strategies available to us, and other discrete items.\nThe increase in our income tax benefit in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 is driven by lower pre-tax income and a change in the mix of pre-tax income (loss) generated across the various jurisdictions in which we operate and reflects the impact of the implementation of certain business and financing strategies. This includes a favorable permanent book-tax difference in our Canadian jurisdiction for certain foreign affiliate dividends. Canadian tax law permits such dividends to be received without being subject to tax. The impact is reflected in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in the table that reconciles income taxes computed at U.S. statutory income tax rates to the income tax provision (benefit).\nNet Income Attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Shareholders. Net income attributable to our shareholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 was $14.8 million, or basic net income per common share of $0.09 on 165.0 million weighted average common shares outstanding and diluted net income per common share of $0.09 on 172.2 million weighted average common shares outstanding. This compares to net income attributable to our shareholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 of $50.2 million, or basic net income per common share of $0.34 on 148.5 million weighted average common shares outstanding and diluted net income per common share of $0.33 on 154.1 million common shares outstanding.\nSegment Results of Operations\nThe segment results of operations presented below do not include the elimination of intersegment transactions which are eliminated when presenting consolidated results, and exclude items separately identified in the restructuring and other line item in the consolidated statement of operations.\nMotion Pictures\nThe table below sets forth Motion Pictures gross contribution and segment profit for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Motion Pictures Segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,920.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,677.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense\n</td> <td>976.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>874.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution & marketing expense\n</td> <td>706.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>619.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution\n</td> <td>237.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>105.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. theatrical P&A expense included in distribution and marketing expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>474.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>393.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>50.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue.

Home entertainment revenues in fiscal 2017 of $193.7 million from our Fiscal 2017 Theatrical Slate titles (primarily Now You See Me 2, Deepwater Horizon, Hacksaw Ridge, Hell or High Water, and Mechanic: Resurrection) compared to home entertainment revenues in fiscal 2016 of $147.2 million from our Fiscal 2016 Theatrical Slate (primarily The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2, Sicario, The Last Witch Hunter and The Age of Adaline). In addition, home entertainment revenue from Other Than Feature Film increased $50.4 million, which included $28.8 million of home entertainment revenue from the Starz third party distribution business from the date of acquisition (December 8, 2016).\nTelevision revenue increased $74.0 million, or 36.1%, in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, due primarily to a greater number of Feature Film titles with television windows opening in fiscal 2017. In particular, significant revenue was generated in fiscal 2017 from our Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 Theatrical Slates (primarily The Divergent Series: Allegiant, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2, Now You See Me 2, Gods of Egypt), which compared to revenue generated in fiscal 2016 from our Fiscal 2015 Theatrical Slate (primarily The Divergent Series: Insurgent, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1, John Wick).\nInternational motion pictures revenue decreased $14.4 million, or 2.6%, in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower revenue from our Fiscal 2017 Theatrical Slate in fiscal 2017, as compared to the revenue generated from our Fiscal 2016 Theatrical Slate in fiscal 2016, which included a significant contribution from The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2.\nDirect Operating Expense. The decrease in direct operating expenses as a percentage of motion pictures revenue was primarily driven by the lower amortization rates in fiscal 2017 of our Fiscal 2017 Theatrical Slate as compared to the amortization rates in fiscal 2016 of our Fiscal 2016 Theatrical Slate, and in particular, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2. Included in Motion Pictures direct operating expenses are investment in film write-downs of approximately $17.0 million in fiscal 2017, compared to approximately $20.4 million in fiscal 2016.\nDistribution and Marketing Expense. The increase in distribution and marketing expense in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 is primarily due to higher theatrical P&A. Theatrical P&A in the Motion Pictures segment in fiscal 2017 increased as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily driven by higher P&A spending in fiscal 2017 on our Feature Film theatrical releases due to a greater number of releases requiring P&A in fiscal 2017, offset partially by lower P&A incurred in advance for films to be released in subsequent periods. In fiscal 2017, approximately $1.9 million of P&A was incurred in advance for films to be released in fiscal 2018, such as All Eyez on Me, How to Be a Latin Lover and American Assassin. In fiscal 2016, approximately $16.6 million of P&A was incurred in advance for films to be released in fiscal 2017, such as Criminal, Now You See Me 2, and Deepwater Horizon.\nGross Contribution. Gross contribution of the Motion Pictures segment for fiscal 2017 increased as compared to fiscal 2016, due to higher revenue and lower direct operating expenses as a percentage of Motion Pictures revenue, offset partially by higher distribution and marketing expenses primarily driven by higher U.S. theatrical P&A associated with a greater number of feature film releases in fiscal 2017.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses of the Motion Pictures segment increased $12.9 million, or 14.0%, primarily due to increases in salaries and related expenses primarily from incentive compensation and to a lesser extent the general and administrative expenses from the Starz third party distribution business from the date of acquisition (December 8, 2016).\nTelevision Production\nThe table below sets forth Television Production gross contribution and segment profit for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Television Production Segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>837.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>669.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense\n</td> <td>711.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>531.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution & marketing expense\n</td> <td>33.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution\n</td> <td>91.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>32.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>85.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue.

Domestic television revenue increased in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to an increase in television episodes delivered, which included a significant contribution of revenue from episodes delivered of Orange Is The New Black Season 5 in fiscal 2017.\nThe increase was also due to increased domestic television revenue from Pilgrim Media Group, acquired on November 12, 2015. Television Production revenue included revenue from Pilgrim Media Group in fiscal 2017 and 2016 of $136.6 million and $52.5 million, respectively, which included revenue from The Runner Season 1, and The Ultimate Fighter Seasons 23 & 24 in fiscal 2017 and from Wicked Tuna Season 5, Bring It Season 3 and Kocktails with Khloe Seasons 1 & 2 in fiscal 2016.\nInternational revenue in fiscal 2017 decreased $41.1 million, or 21.6% as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily driven by a significant contribution in fiscal 2016 from Orange Is the New Black Seasons 1 - 4.\nHome entertainment revenue in fiscal 2017 decreased $20.4 million, or 33.8% as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily driven by a significant contribution of digital revenue from Mad Men Season 7 in fiscal 2016. The decrease was also, to a lesser extent, due to lower packaged media revenue.\nDirect Operating Expense. The increase in direct operating expense is primarily due to an increase in Television Production revenue. The increase in direct operating expenses as a percentage of Television Production revenue is primarily\ndue to the mix of titles generating revenue in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. In particular, fiscal 2017 includes revenue from a greater number of new television programs as compared to fiscal 2016, such as Dear White People, Greenleaf, Feed the Beast, Graves, and Kicking & Screaming, which typically result in higher amortization expenses in relation to revenues initially, until there are a sufficient number of subsequent seasons ordered and episodes produced, such that revenue can be generated from syndication in domestic and international markets.\nGross Contribution. Gross contribution of the Television Production segment for fiscal 2017 decreased as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher direct operating expenses as a percentage of television production revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses of the Television Production segment increased $8.6 million, or 36.6%, primarily due to increases in salaries and related expenses associated with our Television syndication and international production activities and an increase in general and administrative expenses associated with Pilgrim Media Group (acquired November 12, 2015).\nMedia Networks\nThe table below sets forth Media Networks gross contribution and segment profit for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Media Networks was not previously a reportable segment prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2016, and in fiscal 2017, the results of operations in the Media Networks segment represent primarily activity related to Starz Networks from the acquisition date of December 8, 2016 to March 31, 2017. In fiscal 2016, the results of operations in the Media Networks segment represented the Lionsgate legacy direct to consumer streaming services on SVOD platforms (Streaming Services).\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media Networks Segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>456.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense\n</td> <td>202.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution & marketing expense\n</td> <td>70.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution\n</td> <td>183.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>45.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>44.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>40.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth the Media Networks segment revenue and segment profit by product line:\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Starz Networks\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>423.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>423.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Content and Other\n</td> <td>30.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Streaming Services\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>456.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>456.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Profit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Starz Networks\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Content and Other\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Streaming Services\n</td> <td>(35.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________________\nnm - Percentage not meaningful.\nRevenue.

Media Networks, to a lesser extent, also includes revenue from licensing its original series programming in ancillary markets.\nDirect Operating and Distribution and Marketing Expenses. Starz Networks' direct operating and distribution and marketing expenses primarily represent programming cost amortization and advertising and marketing costs that have been expensed since December 8, 2016 (date of Starz Merger). The level of programing cost amortization and advertising and marketing costs and thus the gross contribution margin for the Media Networks segment can fluctuate from period to period depending on the number of new shows and particularly new original series premiering on the network during the period. Programming cost amortization and marketing costs generally increase in periods where new original series are premiering on STARZ. During the period from December 8, 2016 through March 31, 2017, the original series, Black Sails (Season 4) (premiere date of January 29, 2017) and The Missing (Season 2) (premiere date of February 12, 2017), premiered on STARZ.\nGross Contribution. Gross contribution of the Media Networks segment for fiscal 2017 was primarily from Starz Networks.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses of the Media Networks segment in fiscal 2017 of $45.0 million represent general and administrative expenses associated with Starz Networks from the acquisition date of December 8, 2016 to March 31, 2017, and Streaming Services.\nMedia Networks Supplemental Pro Forma Financial Information:\nThe following table sets forth the Media Networks segment profit on a pro forma basis as if the Starz Merger and our segment reorganization (see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements) occurred on April 1, 2015:\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media Networks Segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,458.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,419.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense\n</td> <td>686.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>718.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution & marketing expense\n</td> <td>203.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution\n</td> <td>569.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>529.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>122.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>447.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>405.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>39.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNOTE: The pro forma amounts above were determined by combining the historical financial information of Lionsgate and Starz for each respective period, applying the new Lionsgate segment structure (see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements), and applying the acquisition related accounting.

The primary component of Media Networks revenue is Starz Networks revenue. On a pro forma basis, Starz Networks revenue represented 94% of Media Networks revenue for fiscal 2017 and 2016. The increase in pro forma revenue was primarily due to an increase in revenue from Starz Networks, due to higher effective rates driven by growth in subscribers to our Starz branded OTT platforms, offset by a $17 million decrease related to the fiscal 2016 sale of Starz's animation studio, Film Roman, LLC, in October 2015 included in Content and Other.\nDirect Operating and Distribution and Marketing Expense. The decrease in pro forma direct operating expense for Starz Networks is primarily due to lower programming cost amortization expenses associated with a lower cost per film and a lower number of exhibitions of content under output licensing arrangements.\nThe increase in pro forma distribution and marketing expense is primarily the result of an increase in Starz Networks' advertising and marketing costs due to increased spend associated with the launch of the Starz app.\nGross Contribution. On a pro forma basis, gross contribution of the Media Networks segment for fiscal 2017 was primarily from Starz Networks. The pro forma increase in gross contribution is driven by increased gross contribution from Starz Networks, primarily due to higher revenue and lower direct operating expense from Starz Networks, partially offset by an increase in distribution and marketing expense.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. Pro forma general and administrative expenses of the Media Networks segment in fiscal 2017 decreased slightly due to lower Starz Networks general and administrative expenses, mostly offset by increased costs associated with our start-up direct to consumer streaming services on SVOD platforms (Streaming Services).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur liquidity and capital resources have been provided principally through cash generated from operations, debt, and our production loans. Our debt at March 31, 2018 primarily consisted of our Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan A, Term Loan B, 5.875% senior notes due 2024 (the \"5.875% Senior Notes\") and convertible senior subordinated notes.\nOur principal uses of cash in operations include the funding of film and television productions, film and programming rights acquisitions, and the distribution and marketing of films and television programs. We also use cash for debt service (i.e. principal and interest payments) requirements, equity or cost method investments, quarterly cash dividends, the purchase of common shares under our share repurchase program, capital expenditures, and acquisitions of businesses. The Company also has a redeemable noncontrolling interest balance of $101.8 million, which may require the use of cash in the event the holders of the noncontrolling interests require the Company to repurchase their interests (see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements).\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nAnticipated Cash Requirements. The nature of our business is such that significant initial expenditures are required to produce, acquire, distribute and market films and television programs, while revenues from these films and television programs are earned over an extended period of time after their completion or acquisition. We believe that cash flow from operations, cash on hand, revolving credit facility availability, tax-efficient financing, and available production financing will be adequate to meet known operational cash, and debt service (i.e. principal and interest payments) requirements for the foreseeable future, including the funding of future film and television production, film and programming rights acquisitions and theatrical and video release schedules, and future equity or cost method investment funding requirements, and the purchase of common shares under our share repurchase program. We monitor our cash flow liquidity, availability, fixed charge coverage, capital base, film spending and leverage ratios with the long-term goal of maintaining our credit worthiness.\nOur current financing strategy is to fund operations and to leverage investment in films and television programs through our cash flow from operations, our revolving credit facility, single-purpose production financing, government incentive programs, film funds, and distribution commitments. In addition, we may acquire businesses or assets, including individual films or libraries that are complementary to our business. Any such transaction could be financed through our cash flow from operations, credit facilities, equity or debt financing. If additional financing beyond our existing cash flows from operations and credit facilities cannot fund such transactions, there is no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to\nus. We may also dispose of businesses or assets, including individual films or libraries, and use the net proceeds from such dispositions to fund operations or such acquisitions, or to repay debt.\nShare Repurchase Plan. On February 2, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized to increase our previously announced share repurchase plan from $300 million to $468 million. To date, approximately $283.2 million of our common shares have been purchased, leaving approximately $184.7 million of authorized potential purchases. The remaining $184.7 million of our common shares may be purchased from time to time at our discretion, including quantity, timing and price thereof, and will be subject to market conditions. Such purchases will be structured as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. We did not repurchase any shares during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.\nDividends. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.09 per each of the Class A voting shares, and the Class B non-voting shares, payable May 1, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 31, 2018.The amount of any future dividends, if any, that we pay to our shareholders is determined by our Board of Directors, at its discretion, and is dependent on a number of factors, including our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements and restrictions under our credit agreements, and shall be in compliance with applicable law. We cannot guarantee the amount of dividends paid in the future, if any.\nDiscussion of Operating, Investing, Financing Cash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents increased by $59.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, increased by $263.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, and decreased by $45.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, before foreign exchange effects on cash. Components of these changes are discussed below in more detail.\nOperating Activities.

Cash flows provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 were $389.2 million compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $558.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 is due to higher investment in films and television program and program rights and decreases from changes in other operating assets and liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by higher cash flows from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities and lower increases in accounts receivables.\nFiscal 2017 as Compared to Fiscal 2016. Cash flows provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 were $558.6 million compared to cash flows used in operating activities of $19.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the\nfiscal year ended March 31, 2016 is due to higher cash flows from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities, lower increases in accounts receivables, and increases from changes in other operating assets and liabilities.\nInvesting Activities.

In connection with the Second Amendment, the Company repaid in full the then outstanding principal amounts of $950.0 million under the Previous Term Loan A and $825.0 million under the Previous Term Loan B-1, and terminated all commitments under the Previous Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the Company incurred a new five-year Term Loan A in aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million (the \"Term Loan A\"), incurred a new seven-year Term Loan B in aggregate principal amount of $1,250.0 million (the \"Term Loan B\"), and obtained a new $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\", and together with the Term Loan A and Term Loan B, the \"Senior Credit Facilities\"). The interest rate under the new Term Loan A and Revolving Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 1.75%. See the \"Senior Credit Facilities\" section above for interest rate details and required principal payments.\nOther Voluntary Prepayments. In addition to the prepayments in connection with the Repricing Amendment and Second Amendment described above, during the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company made other voluntary prepayments totaling $740.0 million and $400.0 million, respectively, in principal outstanding under the Previous Term Loan B-1/ Previous Term Loan B, together with accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such principal amounts.\n5.875% Senior Notes Exchange.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nLions Gate Entertainment Corp. (the Company,\u201d Lionsgate,\u201d \"Lions Gate,\" we,\u201d us\u201d or our\u201d) is a vertically integrated next generation global content leader with a diversified presence in motion picture production and distribution, television programming and syndication, premium pay television networks, home entertainment, global distribution and sales, interactive ventures and games and location-based entertainment. We classify our operations through three reporting segments: Motion Pictures, Television Production, and Media Networks (see further discussion below).\nStarz Merger\nOn December 8, 2016, upon shareholder approval, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 30, 2016 (\"Merger Agreement\"), Lionsgate and Starz consummated a merger, under which Lionsgate acquired Starz for a combination of cash and common stock (the \"Starz Merger\"). See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further details of the Starz Merger.\nFollowing the Starz Merger, beginning in the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the Company reorganized its segment structure and now manages and reports its operating results through three reportable business segments: Motion Pictures, Television Production and Media Networks (Media Networks was not a reportable segment prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2016). As a result of the Starz Merger, beginning December 8, 2016, the Motion Pictures segment includes Starz's third-party distribution business. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for our segment information disclosure.\nRevenues\nOur revenues are derived from the Motion Pictures, Television Production and Media Networks segments, as described below. Our revenues are derived from the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and other foreign countries. None of the non-U.S. countries individually comprised greater than 10% of total revenues for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nMotion Pictures\nOur Motion Pictures segment includes revenues derived from the following:\n \u2022 Theatrical. Theatrical revenues are derived from the domestic theatrical release of motion pictures licensed to theatrical exhibitors on a picture-by-picture basis (distributed by us directly in the U.S. and through a sub-distributor in Canada). The revenues from Canada are reported net of distribution fees and release expenses of the Canadian sub-distributor. The financial terms that we negotiate with our theatrical exhibitors in the U.S. generally provide that we receive a percentage of the box office results and are negotiated on a picture-by-picture basis. \n \u2022 Home Entertainment. Home entertainment revenues are derived from the sale or rental of our film productions and acquired or licensed films and certain television programs (including theatrical and direct-to-video releases) on packaged media and through digital media platforms. In addition, we have revenue sharing arrangements with certain digital media platforms which generally provide that, in exchange for a nominal or no upfront sales price, we share in the rental or sales revenues generated by the platform on a title-by-title basis. \n \u2022 Television. Television revenues are primarily derived from the licensing of our theatrical productions and acquired films to the linear pay, basic cable and free television markets. \n \u2022 International. International revenues are derived from the licensing from our international subsidiaries of our productions, acquired films, our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles to international distributors, on a territory-by-territory basis. International revenues also include revenues from the direct distribution of our productions, acquired films, and our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles in the United Kingdom. \n \u2022 Other. Other revenues are derived from, among others, our interactive ventures and games division, our global franchise management and strategic partnerships division (which includes location-based entertainment), the sales and licensing of music from the theatrical exhibition of our films and the television broadcast of our productions, and from the licensing of our film and television content to ancillary markets. \nTelevision Production\nOur Television Production segment includes revenues derived from the following:\n \u2022 Domestic Television. Domestic television revenues are derived from the licensing and syndication to domestic markets of scripted and unscripted series, television movies, mini-series and non-fiction programming. \n \u2022 International. International revenues are derived from the licensing and syndication to international markets of scripted and unscripted series, television movies, mini-series and non-fiction programming. \n \u2022 Home Entertainment. Home entertainment revenues are derived from the sale or rental of television production movies or series on packaged media and through digital media platforms. \n \u2022 Other. Other revenues are derived from, among others, product integration in our television episodes and programs, the sales and licensing of music from the television broadcasts of our productions, and from the licensing of our television programs to ancillary markets.  Media Networks\nOur Media Networks segment includes revenues derived from the following:\n \u2022 Starz Networks. Starz Networks' revenues are derived from the distribution of our STARZ branded premium subscription video services pursuant to affiliation agreements with U.S. multichannel video programming distributors ( MVPDs\u201d), including cable operators, satellite television providers and telecommunications companies, and over-the-top (\"OTT\") providers (collectively, Distributors\u201d), and on a direct-to-consumer basis. Starz Networks' revenue is recognized in the period during which programming is provided, either: (i) based solely on the total number of subscribers who receive our services multiplied by rates specified in the affiliation agreements; (ii) based on amounts or rates specified in the affiliation agreements which are not tied solely to the total number of subscribers who receive our services, or (iii) the total number of subscribers who receive our direct-to-consumer service multiplied by the applicable retail rate. \n \u2022 Content and Other. Original content revenues are derived from the licensing of Starz original programming to digital media platforms, international television networks, through packaged media and other ancillary markets. \n \u2022 Streaming Services. Streaming services revenues are derived from the Lionsgate legacy start-up direct to consumer streaming services on subscription video-on-demand (\"SVOD\") platforms.  Expenses\nOur primary operating expenses include direct operating expenses, distribution and marketing expenses and general and administration expenses.\nDirect operating expenses include amortization of film and television production or acquisition costs, amortization of programming production or acquisition costs and programming related salaries, participation and residual expenses, provision for doubtful accounts, and foreign exchange gains and losses.\nParticipation costs represent contingent consideration payable based on the performance of the film or television program to parties associated with the film or television program, including producers, writers, directors or actors. Residuals represent amounts payable to various unions or guilds\u201d such as the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, Directors Guild of America, and Writers Guild of America, based on the performance of the film or television program in certain ancillary markets or based on the individual's (i.e., actor, director, writer) salary level in the television market.\nDistribution and marketing expenses primarily include the costs of theatrical prints and advertising ( P&A\u201d) and of DVD/Blu-ray duplication and marketing. Theatrical P&A includes the costs of the theatrical prints delivered to theatrical exhibitors and the advertising and marketing cost associated with the theatrical release of the picture. DVD/Blu-ray duplication represents the cost of the DVD/Blu-ray product and the manufacturing costs associated with creating the physical products. DVD/Blu-ray marketing costs represent the cost of advertising the product at or near the time of its release or special promotional advertising. Marketing costs for Media Networks includes advertising, consumer marketing, distributor marketing support and other marketing costs. In addition, distribution and marketing costs includes our Media Networks segment operating costs for the direct-to-consumer service, transponder expenses and maintenance and repairs.\nGeneral and administration expenses include salaries and other overhead.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. As described more fully below, these estimates bear the risk of change due to the inherent uncertainty of the estimate. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. For a summary of all of our accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting for Films and Television Programs and Program Rights. We capitalize costs of production and acquisition, including financing costs and production overhead, to investment in films and television programs. These costs for an individual film or television program are amortized and participation and residual costs are accrued to direct operating expenses in the proportion that current year's revenues bear to management's estimates of the ultimate revenue at the beginning of the current year expected to be recognized from the exploitation, exhibition or sale of such film or television program. Ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed ten years following the date of initial release of the motion picture. For an episodic television series, the period over which ultimate revenues are estimated cannot exceed ten years following the date of delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production, five years from the date of delivery of the most recent episode, if later. For previously released film or television programs acquired as part of a library, ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed twenty years from the date of acquisition.\nDue to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates of ultimate revenues and expenses, these estimates have differed in the past from actual results and are likely to differ to some extent in the future from actual results. In addition, in the normal course of our business, some films and titles are more successful or less successful than anticipated. Management regularly reviews and revises when necessary its ultimate revenue and cost estimates, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization of film costs and participations and residuals and/or write-down of all or a portion of the unamortized costs of the film or television program to its estimated fair value. Management estimates the ultimate revenue based on experience with similar titles or title genre, the general public appeal of the cast, actual performance (when available) at the box office or in markets currently being exploited, and other factors such as the quality and acceptance of motion pictures or programs that our competitors release into the marketplace at or near the same time, critical reviews, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, many of which we do not control and which may change.\nAn increase in the estimate of ultimate revenue will generally result in a lower amortization rate and, therefore, less film and television program amortization expense, while a decrease in the estimate of ultimate revenue will generally result in a higher amortization rate and, therefore, higher film and television program amortization expense, and also periodically results in an impairment requiring a write-down of the film cost to the title's fair value. These write-downs are included in amortization expense within direct operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Investment in films and television programs is stated at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value. The valuation of investment in films and television programs is reviewed on a title-by-title basis, when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a film or television program is less than its unamortized cost. In determining the fair value of our films and television programs, we employ a discounted cash flows (\"DCF\") methodology with assumptions for cash flows. Key inputs employed in the DCF methodology include estimates of a film's ultimate revenue and costs as well as a discount rate. The discount rate utilized in the DCF analysis is based on our weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium representing the risk associated with producing a particular film or television program. The fair value of any film costs associated with a film or television program that we plan to abandon is zero. As the primary determination of fair value is determined using a DCF model, the resulting fair value is considered a Level 3 measurement (as defined in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements). Additional amortization is recorded in the amount by which the unamortized costs exceed the estimated fair value of the film or television program. Estimates of future revenue involve measurement uncertainty and it is therefore possible that reductions in the carrying value of investment in films and television programs may be required as a consequence of changes in our future revenue estimates.\nProgram rights for films and television programs (including original series) exhibited by the Media Networks segment are generally amortized on a title-by-title or episode-by-episode basis over the anticipated number of exhibitions or license period. We estimate the number of exhibitions based on the number of exhibitions allowed in the agreement and the expected usage of the content. Certain other program rights are amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the respective lives of the\nagreements. Programming rights may include rights to more than one exploitation windows under its output and library agreements. For films with multiple windows, the license fee is allocated between the windows based upon the proportionate estimated fair value of each window which generally results in the majority of the cost allocated to the first window on newer releases. Programming costs vary due to the number of airings and cost of our original series, the number of films licensed and the cost per film paid under our output and library programming agreements.\nThe cost of the Media Networks' segment original content is allocated between the pay television market and the ancillary revenue markets (e.g., home video, digital platforms, international television, etc.) based on the estimated relative fair values of these markets. The amount associated with the pay television market is reclassified to program rights when the program is aired and the portion attributable to the ancillary markets remains in investment in films and television programs. Costs allocated to the pay television market are amortized to expense over the anticipated number of exhibitions for each original series while costs associated with the ancillary revenue markets are amortized to expense based on the proportion that current revenue from the original series bears to its ultimate revenue. Estimates of fair value for the pay television and ancillary markets involve uncertainty as well as estimates of ultimate revenue. All the costs of programming produced by the Media Networks segment and included in investment in films and television programs and program rights, net are classified as long term. Amounts included in program rights, other than internally produced programming, that are expected to be amortized within a year from the balance sheet date are classified as short-term.\nChanges in management's estimate of the anticipated exhibitions of films and original series on our networks could result in the earlier recognition of our programming costs than anticipated. Conversely, scheduled exhibitions may not capture the appropriate usage of the program rights in current periods which would lead to the write-off of additional program rights in future periods and may have a significant impact on our future results of operations and our financial position.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue from the theatrical release of feature films is recognized at the time of exhibition based on our participation in box office receipts. Revenue from the sale of DVDs and Blu-ray discs in the retail market, net of an allowance for estimated returns and other allowances, is recognized on the later of receipt by the customer or street date\u201d (when it is available for sale by the customer). Under revenue sharing arrangements, including digital and EST arrangements, such as download-to-own, download-to-rent, video-on-demand, and subscription video-on-demand, revenue is recognized when we are entitled to receipts and such receipts are determinable. Revenues from television or digital licensing for fixed fees are recognized when the feature film or television program is available to the licensee for telecast. For television licenses that include separate availability windows\u201d during the license period, revenue is allocated to the windows\u201d of availability in the arrangement. Revenue from sales to international territories are recognized when access to the feature film or television program has been granted or delivery has occurred, as required under the contract, and the right to exploit the feature film or television program has commenced. For multiple media rights contracts with a fee for a single film or television program where the contract provides for media holdbacks (defined as contractual media release restrictions), the fee is allocated to the various media based on our assessment of the relative fair value of the rights to exploit each media and is recognized as each holdback is released. For multiple-title contracts with a fee, the fee is allocated on a title-by-title basis, based on our assessment of the relative fair value of each title.\nProgramming revenue is recognized in the period during which programming is provided, pursuant to affiliation agreements. If an affiliation agreement has expired and our programming is continuing to be aired by the Distributor, revenue is recognized based on the terms of the expired agreement or the actual payment from the distributor, whichever is less. Payments to distributors for marketing support costs for which Starz does not receive a direct benefit are recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nSales Returns Allowance. Revenues are recorded net of estimated returns and other allowances. We estimate reserves for DVD/Blu-ray returns based on previous returns experience, point-of-sale data available from certain retailers, current economic trends, and projected future sales of the title to the consumer based on the actual performance of similar titles on a title-by-title basis in each of the DVD/Blu-ray businesses. Factors affecting actual returns include, among other factors, limited retail shelf space at various times of the year, success of advertising or other sales promotions, and the near term release of competing titles. We believe that our estimates have been materially accurate in the past; however, due to the judgment involved in establishing reserves, we may have adjustments to our historical estimates in the future. Our estimate of future returns affects reported revenue and operating income. If we underestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amounts. If we overestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record additional revenue in later periods when returns are less than estimated. An incremental change of 1% in our estimated sales returns rate (i.e., provisions for returns divided by gross sales of related product) for home entertainment products would have had an impact of approximately $6.0 million, $7.1 million and $5.4 million on our total revenue in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nProvisions for Accounts Receivable. We estimate provisions for accounts receivable based on historical experience and relevant facts and information regarding the collectability of the accounts receivable. In performing this evaluation, significant judgments and estimates are involved, including an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for our larger customers and an analysis of the length of time receivables have been past due. The financial condition of a given customer and its ability to pay may change over time or could be better or worse than anticipated and could result in an increase or decrease to our allowance for doubtful accounts, which is recorded in direct operating expenses.\nIncome Taxes. We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the U.S., and in several foreign jurisdictions. We record deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences, net of applicable reserves in these jurisdictions. We recognize a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis; otherwise a valuation allowance is applied. In order to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets, we will need to generate sufficient taxable income in the future in each of the jurisdictions which have these deferred tax assets. However, the assessment as to whether there will be sufficient taxable income in a jurisdiction to realize our net deferred tax assets in that jurisdiction is an estimate which could change in the future depending primarily upon the actual performance of our Company. We will be required to continually evaluate the more likely than not assessment that our net deferred tax assets will be realized, and if operating results deteriorate in a particular jurisdiction, we may need to record a valuation allowance for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets through a charge to our income tax provision. Based on our assessment in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we recorded a valuation allowance of $68.2 million against certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets that may not be realized on a more likely than not basis.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was signed into law, making significant changes to the taxation of U.S. business entities. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed a one-time transition tax in connection with the move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, provided for accelerated deductions for certain U.S. film production costs, imposed limitations on certain tax deductions such as executive compensation in future periods, and included numerous other provisions. We are currently in the process of evaluating the full impact of the Tax Act on our financial statements and have not completed this evaluation. We have reported provisional amounts reflecting our reasonable estimates of the impact of the Tax Act. The estimated impact of the Tax Act is based on a preliminary review of the new law and is subject to revision based upon further analysis and interpretation of the Tax Act.\nOur effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate and are affected by many factors, including the overall level of pre-tax income, mix of our pre-tax income generated across the various jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in tax laws and regulations in those jurisdictions, further interpretation and legislative guidance regarding the new Tax Act, changes in valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, tax planning strategies available to us and other discrete items.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment each fiscal year or between the annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We perform our annual impairment test as of January 1 in each fiscal year. We performed our last annual impairment test on our goodwill as of January 1, 2018 by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there was a potential goodwill impairment. Based on our qualitative assessments, including but not limited to, the results of our most recent quantitative impairment test, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cash flows, and changes in our share price, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value.\nConsolidation. We consolidate entities in which we own more than 50% of the voting common stock and control operations and also variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. Investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own more than 20% of the voting common stock or otherwise exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but not control of the nonconsolidated affiliate, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own less than 20% of the voting common stock are accounted for using the cost method of accounting.\nBusiness Combinations. We account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value. Goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired, net of assumed liabilities. Determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives among other items.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Due to the Starz Merger, fiscal 2017 includes the results of operations from Starz from the acquisition date of December 8, 2016. Revenue from Starz across all segments was $1.65 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $483.2 million for the period from the acquisition date of December 8, 2016 to March 31, 2017.\n\n_____________________\nnm - Percentage not meaningful\nRevenues. Consolidated revenues increased in fiscal 2018, due to the inclusion of Starz revenue for the entire fiscal year, as compared to the period from the acquisition date of December 8, 2016 to March 31, 2017 in fiscal 2017, offset partially by decreases in Motion Pictures revenues and, to a lesser extent, Television Production revenues. The Media Networks and Motion Pictures revenues in fiscal 2018 include $1,525.4 million and $126.4 million, respectively, of revenues from Starz, as compared to $453.7 million and $29.5 million, respectively, in fiscal 2017 from the date of acquisition.\nThe decrease in Motion Pictures revenue was primarily due to decreases in theatrical and international revenue driven by our smaller theatrical slate (15 feature films released in fiscal 2018 compared to 18 in fiscal 2017). In addition, fiscal 2017 included significant theatrical and international contributions from La La Land, Now You See Me 2 and Deepwater Horizon. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in Motion Pictures home entertainment revenue, driven by a greater contribution in fiscal 2018 from the Starz third party distribution business as a result of the Starz Merger.\nA significant component of revenue comes from home entertainment. The following table sets forth total home entertainment revenue for our reporting segments for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\nDirect Operating Expenses. Direct operating expenses by segment were as follows for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\n_______________________\nnm - Percentage not meaningful.\nDirect operating expenses increased in fiscal 2018, primarily due to the inclusion of Starz expenses for the entire fiscal year and a slight increase in Motion Pictures direct operating expense. These increases were offset partially by lower Television Production direct operating expenses attributable to lower Television Production revenue, and lower direct operating expenses as a percentage of Television Production revenue. See further discussion in the Segment Results of Operations section below.\nOther primarily consists of the amortization of the non-cash fair value adjustments on film and television assets associated with the application of purchase accounting related to the acquisition of Starz, Pilgrim Media Group and Good Universe and to a lesser extent, share-based compensation associated with certain employees whose salaries are included in Media Networks direct operating expense.\nDistribution and Marketing Expenses. Distribution and marketing expenses by segment were as follows for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\n_______________________\nnm - Percentage not meaningful.\nDistribution and Marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2018, due to the inclusion of distribution and marketing expenses from Starz in the Media Networks segment for the entire fiscal year, offset partially by decreased Motion Pictures theatrical P&A expenses. See further discussion in the Segment Results of Operations section below.\nOther consists of share-based compensation associated with certain employees whose salaries are included in Media Networks distribution and marketing expense.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses by segment were as follows for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\n_______________________\nnm - Percentage not meaningful.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2018, resulting from the inclusion of general and administrative expense from Starz in the Media Networks segment for a full fiscal year, increased corporate general and administrative expenses, higher share-based compensation expense, and increased Motion Pictures and Television Production general and administrative expense. See further discussion in the Segment Results of Operations section below.\nCorporate general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increases in professional fees and salaries and related expenses.\nShare-based compensation expense represents the portion of share-based compensation expense included in general and administrative expenses that is not allocated to segment or corporate general and administrative expense. The increase in share-based compensation expense included in general and administrative expense is primarily due to compensation expense associated with the replacement of Starz share-based payment awards (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). The following table reconciles this amount to total share-based compensation expense:\n\n_______________________\n(1)Represents share-based compensation expense included in restructuring and other expenses reflecting the impact of the acceleration of certain vesting schedules for equity awards pursuant to certain severance arrangements.\nPurchase accounting and related adjustments represent the charge for the accretion of the noncontrolling interest discount related to Pilgrim Media Group that is included in general and administrative expense (see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements).\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization of $159.0 million for fiscal 2018 increased $95.9 million from $63.1 million in fiscal 2017. The increase is primarily due to the depreciation and amortization associated with the property and equipment and intangible assets related to the Starz acquisition.\nRestructuring and Other. Restructuring and other decreased $28.9 million, and includes restructuring and severance costs, certain transaction and related costs, and certain unusual items, when applicable and were as follows for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements):\n\n_______________________\nnm - Percentage not meaningful.\n (1) Severance costs in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 were primarily related to the restructuring of the Motion Pictures business in connection with the acquisition of Good Universe and additional workforce reductions in connection with the Starz Merger. Severance costs in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 were primarily related to workforce reductions for redundancies in connection with the Starz Merger. \n (2) Transaction and related costs in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 reflect transaction, integration and legal costs incurred associated with certain strategic transactions. In fiscal 2018, these costs were primarily related to the the sale of EPIX (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements), the Starz Merger, legal fees associated with the Starz class action lawsuits and certain other legal matters. In fiscal 2017, these costs were primarily related to the Starz Merger, the legal fees associated with the Starz class action lawsuits, and an arbitration award of $5.8 million and related legal expenses. \n (3) Development expense in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 represents write-downs resulting from the restructuring of the Motion Pictures business in connection with the acquisition of Good Universe and new management's decisions around the creative direction on certain development projects which were abandoned in the fiscal year.  Interest Expense. Interest expense of $193.7 million in fiscal 2018 increased $78.5 million from fiscal 2017, driven by the increase in debt in connection with the Starz Merger and interest accrued in connection with the dissenting shareholders' liability associated with the Starz Merger. The following table sets forth the components of interest expense for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\n______________________\n (1) See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further description of our debt transactions. \n (2) Represents interest accrued in connection with the dissenting shareholders' liability associated with the Starz Merger. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.  Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $35.7 million in fiscal 2018, related to the March 2018 Senior Credit Facilities refinancing, the March 2018 exchange of $512.3 million of the 5.875% Senior Notes, the December 2017 Term Loan B refinancing, and other voluntary prepayments on the Previous Term Loan B-1/ Previous Term Loan B. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail of these transactions.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $40.4 million in fiscal 2017 related to the extinguishment of debt in connection with the Starz Merger financing in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and the early repayment of $400.0 million in principal amount on the Previous Term Loan B in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nGain on Sale of Equity Interest in EPIX. Gain on sale of equity interest in EPIX in fiscal 2018 of $201.0 million represents the gain recorded in connection with the May 11, 2017 sale of our 31.15% equity interest in EPIX to MGM (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements). There was no comparable gain in fiscal 2017.\nGain on Starz Investment. Gain on Starz investment in fiscal 2017 of $20.4 million represents the difference between the fair value of the Starz available-for-sale securities on the date of the Starz Merger (December 8, 2016) and the original cost of the previously held Starz available-for-sale securities, with no comparable gain in fiscal 2018.\nImpairment of Long-Term Investments and Other Assets. During fiscal 2018, we recognized $29.2 million of other-than-temporary impairments on our investments and notes receivable (included in other assets), which were written down to their estimated fair value (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements). There was no comparable charge in fiscal 2017.\nEquity Interests Income (Loss). The following table represents our portion of the income or (loss) of our equity method investees based on our percentage ownership for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\n______________________\n (1) In May 2017, we sold all of our 31.15% equity interest in EPIX to MGM (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements). \n (2) We license certain of our theatrical releases and other films and television programs to EPIX and Pop. A portion of the profits of these licenses reflecting our ownership share in the venture is eliminated through an adjustment to the equity interest income (loss) of Pop and EPIX (through the date of sale of our ownership interest of May 11, 2017). These profits are recognized as they are realized by the venture (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements). \n (3) Other primarily consists of equity interest losses from our equity method interests in Laugh Out Loud, Playco, Atom Tickets and Defy Media Group in fiscal 2018, compared to equity interest losses from our equity method interest in Atom Tickets and Playco in fiscal 2017. \nIncome Tax Benefit. We had an income tax benefit of $319.4 million in fiscal 2018, compared to a benefit of $148.9 million in fiscal 2017. Our income tax benefit differs from the federal statutory rate multiplied by pre-tax income (loss) due to the mix of our pre-tax income (loss) generated across the various jurisdictions in which we operate and the tax deductions generated by our capital structure, which includes a favorable permanent book-tax difference in our Canadian jurisdiction for certain foreign affiliate dividends. Canadian tax law permits such dividends to be received without being subject to tax. In addition, our total income tax benefit of $319.4 million in fiscal 2018 includes a net benefit of $259.1 million, consisting of a $165.0 million benefit from the impact of the change in U.S. federal tax rates (see below) on our beginning net deferred tax liability balances, a benefit of $162.3 million primarily for foreign affiliate dividends resulting from an internal capital restructuring in connection with our third party debt refinancing (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements), offset by charges of $58.8 million and $9.4 million from increases in our valuation allowance associated with certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, respectively, that may not be realized on a more likely than not basis. The impact is reflected in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in the table that reconciles income taxes computed at U.S. statutory income tax rates to the income tax provision (benefit).\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was signed into law, making significant changes to the taxation of U.S. business entities. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed a one-time transition tax in connection with the move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, changed the ability to claim certain tax deductions, and included numerous other provisions. As we have a March 31 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 31.5% for our fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, and 21% for subsequent fiscal years. Since we are not in a current U.S federal tax paying position for fiscal 2018, our U.S. tax provision consists primarily of deferred tax benefits calculated at the 21% tax rate. Due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, we recorded a $165.0 million income tax benefit from the reduction of our beginning net U.S. deferred tax liabilities in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, which was considered a provisional amount based on reasonable estimates.\nWe have also made provisional estimates of other effects of the Tax Act, such as the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to executive compensation, the one-time transition tax, net operating loss carryovers, foreign tax credits, and accelerated deductions for U.S. film costs. We are currently in the process of evaluating the full impact of the Tax Act on our financial statements and have not completed this evaluation. We have reported provisional amounts reflecting our reasonable estimates of the impact of the Tax Act. The estimated impact of the Tax Act is based on a preliminary review of the new law and is subject to revision based upon further analysis and interpretation of the Tax Act. We will complete our accounting for the Tax Act once we have obtained, prepared, and analyzed all information needed (including computations) for our analysis, but no later than one year from the enactment date of the Tax Act.\nAt March 31, 2018, we had U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1,260.5 million available to reduce\nfuture federal income taxes which expire beginning in 2029 through 2038, state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $712.8 million available to reduce future state income taxes which expire in varying amounts beginning 2021, and Canadian loss carryforwards of $132.5 million, which will expire beginning in 2034. In addition, at March 31, 2018, we had U.S. credit carryforwards related to foreign taxes paid of approximately $68.3 million to offset future federal income taxes that will expire beginning in 2021.\nNet Income Attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Shareholders. Net income attributable to our shareholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 was $473.6 million, or basic net income per common share of $2.27 on 208.4 million weighted average common shares outstanding and diluted net income per common share of $2.15 on 220.4 million weighted average common shares outstanding. This compares to net income attributable to our shareholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 of $14.8 million, or basic net income per common share of $0.09 on 165.0 million weighted average common shares outstanding and diluted net income per common share of $0.09 on 172.2 million weighted average common shares outstanding.\nSegment Results of Operations\nThe segment results of operations presented below do not include the elimination of intersegment transactions which are eliminated when presenting consolidated results, and exclude items separately identified in the restructuring and other line item in the consolidated statement of operations.\nMotion Pictures\nThe table below sets forth Motion Pictures gross contribution and segment profit for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\nRevenue. The table below sets forth Motion Pictures revenue by media and product category for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\n____________________\n (1) Feature Film: Includes theatrical releases through our Lionsgate and Summit Entertainment film labels, which includes films developed and produced in-house, films co-developed and co-produced and films acquired from third parties. \n (2) Other Than Feature Film: Includes Managed Brands, which represents direct-to-DVD motion pictures, acquired and licensed brands, third-party library product and ancillary-driven platform theatrical releases through our specialty films distribution labels including Lionsgate Premiere, through CodeBlack Films, and with our equity method investee, Roadside Attractions. This category also includes certain specialty theatrical releases with our equity method investee, Pantelion Films, and other titles. \n (3) Digital Media Revenue: Consists of revenues generated from pay-per-view and video-on-demand platforms, EST, and digital rental.  Theatrical revenue decreased $89.9 million, or 24.2%, in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, due to a smaller theatrical slate and the performance of the Feature Films released, which included a significant contribution in fiscal 2017 from La La Land.\nHome entertainment revenue increased $66.3 million, or 9.4%, in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily driven by increased home entertainment revenue from Other Than Feature Film of $86.5 million, partially offset by a decrease of $20.2 million of home entertainment revenue from our Feature Films. The increase in home entertainment revenue from Other Than Feature Film was driven by increased revenue from the Starz third party distribution business in fiscal 2018 (increase of $91.4 million as compared to fiscal 2017). The decrease in home entertainment revenue from our Feature Films was driven by lower packaged media revenue in fiscal 2018 from the smaller Fiscal 2018 theatrical slate, as compared to the packaged media revenue in fiscal 2017 from the Fiscal 2017 theatrical slate, partially offset by higher digital media revenue in fiscal 2018 from our Fiscal 2017 theatrical slate.\nInternational motion pictures revenue decreased $77.1 million, or 14.4%, in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, driven by our smaller Fiscal 2018 theatrical slate, and significant contributions in fiscal 2017 from Now You See Me 2 and Deepwater Horizon.\nDirect Operating Expense. The increase in direct operating expenses as a percentage of motion pictures revenue was primarily driven by the change in the mix of titles and product categories generating revenue in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, and an increase in investment in film write-downs. Included in Motion Pictures direct operating expenses are investment in film write-downs of approximately $33.6 million in fiscal 2018, compared to approximately $17.0 million in fiscal 2017.\nDistribution and Marketing Expense. The decrease in distribution and marketing expense in fiscal 2018 is primarily due to lower theatrical P&A, driven by lower P&A spending in fiscal 2018 on fewer Feature Film theatrical releases. In fiscal 2018, approximately $10.3 million of P&A was incurred in advance for films to be released in fiscal 2019, such as Uncle Drew, Traffik and The Spy Who Dumped Me. In fiscal 2017, approximately $1.9 million of P&A was incurred in advance for films to be released in fiscal 2018, such as All Eyez on Me, How to Be a Latin Lover and American Assassin.\nGross Contribution. Gross contribution and gross contribution margin of the Motion Pictures segment for fiscal 2018 increased as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to lower U.S. theatrical P&A as a percentage of Motion Pictures revenue due to lower P&A spending on the fewer number of Feature Film releases in the current fiscal year, offset partially by higher direct operating expenses as a percentage of Motion Pictures revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses of the Motion Pictures segment increased $7.9 million, or 7.5%, primarily due to increases in salaries and related expenses and incentive compensation.\nTelevision Production\nThe table below sets forth Television Production gross contribution and segment profit for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\nRevenue.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nLions Gate Entertainment Corp. (the Company,\u201d Lionsgate,\u201d \"Lions Gate,\" we,\u201d us\u201d or our\u201d) is a vertically integrated next generation global content leader with a diversified presence in motion picture production and distribution, television programming and syndication, premium pay television networks, home entertainment, global distribution and sales, interactive ventures and games and location-based entertainment. We classify our operations through three reporting segments: Motion Pictures, Television Production, and Media Networks (see further discussion below).\nStarz Merger\nOn December 8, 2016, upon shareholder approval, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 30, 2016 (\"Merger Agreement\"), Lionsgate and Starz consummated a merger, under which Lionsgate acquired Starz for a combination of cash and common stock (the \"Starz Merger\"). See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further details of the Starz Merger.\nFollowing the Starz Merger, beginning in the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the Company reorganized its segment structure and now manages and reports its operating results through three reportable business segments: Motion Pictures, Television Production and Media Networks (Media Networks was not a reportable segment prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2016). As a result of the Starz Merger, beginning December 8, 2016, the Motion Pictures segment includes Starz's third-party distribution business. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for our segment information disclosure.\nRevenues\nOur revenues are derived from the Motion Pictures, Television Production and Media Networks segments, as described below. Our revenues are derived from the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and other foreign countries. None of the non-U.S. countries individually comprised greater than 10% of total revenues for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nMotion Pictures\nOur Motion Pictures segment includes revenues derived from the following:\n \u2022 Theatrical. Theatrical revenues are derived from the domestic theatrical release of motion pictures licensed to theatrical exhibitors on a picture-by-picture basis (distributed by us directly in the U.S. and through a sub-distributor in Canada). The revenues from Canada are reported net of distribution fees and release expenses of the Canadian sub-distributor. The financial terms that we negotiate with our theatrical exhibitors in the U.S. generally provide that we receive a percentage of the box office results and are negotiated on a picture-by-picture basis. \n \u2022 Home Entertainment. Home entertainment revenues are derived from the sale or rental of our film productions and acquired or licensed films and certain television programs (including theatrical and direct-to-video releases) on packaged media and through digital media platforms. In addition, we have revenue sharing arrangements with certain digital media platforms which generally provide that, in exchange for a nominal or no upfront sales price, we share in the rental or sales revenues generated by the platform on a title-by-title basis. \n \u2022 Television. Television revenues are primarily derived from the licensing of our theatrical productions and acquired films to the linear pay, basic cable and free television markets. \n \u2022 International. International revenues are derived from the licensing from our international subsidiaries of our productions, acquired films, our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles to international distributors, on a territory-by-territory basis. International revenues also include revenues from the direct distribution of our productions, acquired films, and our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles in the United Kingdom. \n \u2022 Other. Other revenues are derived from, among others, our interactive ventures and games division, our global franchise management and strategic partnerships division (which includes location-based entertainment), the sales and licensing of music from the theatrical exhibition of our films and the television broadcast of our productions, and from the licensing of our film and television content to ancillary markets. \nTelevision Production\nOur Television Production segment includes revenues derived from the following:\n \u2022 Domestic Television. Domestic television revenues are derived from the licensing and syndication to domestic markets of scripted and unscripted series, television movies, mini-series and non-fiction programming. \n \u2022 International. International revenues are derived from the licensing and syndication to international markets of scripted and unscripted series, television movies, mini-series and non-fiction programming. \n \u2022 Home Entertainment. Home entertainment revenues are derived from the sale or rental of television production movies or series on packaged media and through digital media platforms. \n \u2022 Other. Other revenues are derived from, among others, product integration in our television episodes and programs, the sales and licensing of music from the television broadcasts of our productions, and from the licensing of our television programs to ancillary markets.  Media Networks\nOur Media Networks segment includes revenues derived from the following:\n \u2022 Starz Networks. Starz Networks' revenues are derived from the distribution of our STARZ branded premium subscription video services pursuant to affiliation agreements with U.S. multichannel video programming distributors ( MVPDs\u201d), including cable operators, satellite television providers and telecommunications companies, and over-the-top (\"OTT\") providers (collectively, Distributors\u201d), and on a direct-to-consumer basis. Starz Networks' revenue is recognized in the period during which programming is provided, either: (i) based solely on the total number of subscribers who receive our services multiplied by rates specified in the affiliation agreements; (ii) based on amounts or rates specified in the affiliation agreements which are not tied solely to the total number of subscribers who receive our services, or (iii) the total number of subscribers who receive our direct-to-consumer service multiplied by the applicable retail rate. \n \u2022 Content and Other. Original content revenues are derived from the licensing of Starz original programming to digital media platforms, international television networks, through packaged media and other ancillary markets. \n \u2022 Streaming Services. Streaming services revenues are derived from the Lionsgate legacy start-up direct to consumer streaming services on subscription video-on-demand (\"SVOD\") platforms.  Expenses\nOur primary operating expenses include direct operating expenses, distribution and marketing expenses and general and administration expenses.\nDirect operating expenses include amortization of film and television production or acquisition costs, amortization of programming production or acquisition costs and programming related salaries, participation and residual expenses, provision for doubtful accounts, and foreign exchange gains and losses.\nParticipation costs represent contingent consideration payable based on the performance of the film or television program to parties associated with the film or television program, including producers, writers, directors or actors. Residuals represent amounts payable to various unions or guilds\u201d such as the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, Directors Guild of America, and Writers Guild of America, based on the performance of the film or television program in certain ancillary markets or based on the individual's (i.e., actor, director, writer) salary level in the television market.\nDistribution and marketing expenses primarily include the costs of theatrical prints and advertising ( P&A\u201d) and of DVD/Blu-ray duplication and marketing. Theatrical P&A includes the costs of the theatrical prints delivered to theatrical exhibitors and the advertising and marketing cost associated with the theatrical release of the picture. DVD/Blu-ray duplication represents the cost of the DVD/Blu-ray product and the manufacturing costs associated with creating the physical products. DVD/Blu-ray marketing costs represent the cost of advertising the product at or near the time of its release or special promotional advertising. Marketing costs for Media Networks includes advertising, consumer marketing, distributor marketing support and other marketing costs. In addition, distribution and marketing costs includes our Media Networks segment operating costs for the direct-to-consumer service, transponder expenses and maintenance and repairs.\nGeneral and administration expenses include salaries and other overhead.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. As described more fully below, these estimates bear the risk of change due to the inherent uncertainty of the estimate. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. For a summary of all of our accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting for Films and Television Programs and Program Rights. We capitalize costs of production and acquisition, including financing costs and production overhead, to investment in films and television programs. These costs for an individual film or television program are amortized and participation and residual costs are accrued to direct operating expenses in the proportion that current year's revenues bear to management's estimates of the ultimate revenue at the beginning of the current year expected to be recognized from the exploitation, exhibition or sale of such film or television program. Ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed ten years following the date of initial release of the motion picture. For an episodic television series, the period over which ultimate revenues are estimated cannot exceed ten years following the date of delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production, five years from the date of delivery of the most recent episode, if later. For previously released film or television programs acquired as part of a library, ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed twenty years from the date of acquisition.\nDue to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates of ultimate revenues and expenses, these estimates have differed in the past from actual results and are likely to differ to some extent in the future from actual results. In addition, in the normal course of our business, some films and titles are more successful or less successful than anticipated. Management regularly reviews and revises when necessary its ultimate revenue and cost estimates, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization of film costs and participations and residuals and/or write-down of all or a portion of the unamortized costs of the film or television program to its estimated fair value. Management estimates the ultimate revenue based on experience with similar titles or title genre, the general public appeal of the cast, actual performance (when available) at the box office or in markets currently being exploited, and other factors such as the quality and acceptance of motion pictures or programs that our competitors release into the marketplace at or near the same time, critical reviews, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, many of which we do not control and which may change.\nAn increase in the estimate of ultimate revenue will generally result in a lower amortization rate and, therefore, less film and television program amortization expense, while a decrease in the estimate of ultimate revenue will generally result in a higher amortization rate and, therefore, higher film and television program amortization expense, and also periodically results in an impairment requiring a write-down of the film cost to the title's fair value. These write-downs are included in amortization expense within direct operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Investment in films and television programs is stated at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value. The valuation of investment in films and television programs is reviewed on a title-by-title basis, when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a film or television program is less than its unamortized cost. In determining the fair value of our films and television programs, we employ a discounted cash flows (\"DCF\") methodology with assumptions for cash flows. Key inputs employed in the DCF methodology include estimates of a film's ultimate revenue and costs as well as a discount rate. The discount rate utilized in the DCF analysis is based on our weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium representing the risk associated with producing a particular film or television program. The fair value of any film costs associated with a film or television program that we plan to abandon is zero. As the primary determination of fair value is determined using a DCF model, the resulting fair value is considered a Level 3 measurement (as defined in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements). Additional amortization is recorded in the amount by which the unamortized costs exceed the estimated fair value of the film or television program. Estimates of future revenue involve measurement uncertainty and it is therefore possible that reductions in the carrying value of investment in films and television programs may be required as a consequence of changes in our future revenue estimates.\nProgram rights for films and television programs (including original series) exhibited by the Media Networks segment are generally amortized on a title-by-title or episode-by-episode basis over the anticipated number of exhibitions or license period. We estimate the number of exhibitions based on the number of exhibitions allowed in the agreement and the expected usage of the content. Certain other program rights are amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the respective lives of the\nagreements. Programming rights may include rights to more than one exploitation windows under its output and library agreements. For films with multiple windows, the license fee is allocated between the windows based upon the proportionate estimated fair value of each window which generally results in the majority of the cost allocated to the first window on newer releases. Programming costs vary due to the number of airings and cost of our original series, the number of films licensed and the cost per film paid under our output and library programming agreements.\nThe cost of the Media Networks' segment original content is allocated between the pay television market and the ancillary revenue markets (e.g., home video, digital platforms, international television, etc.) based on the estimated relative fair values of these markets. The amount associated with the pay television market is reclassified to program rights when the program is aired and the portion attributable to the ancillary markets remains in investment in films and television programs. Costs allocated to the pay television market are amortized to expense over the anticipated number of exhibitions for each original series while costs associated with the ancillary revenue markets are amortized to expense based on the proportion that current revenue from the original series bears to its ultimate revenue. Estimates of fair value for the pay television and ancillary markets involve uncertainty as well as estimates of ultimate revenue. All the costs of programming produced by the Media Networks segment and included in investment in films and television programs and program rights, net are classified as long term. Amounts included in program rights, other than internally produced programming, that are expected to be amortized within a year from the balance sheet date are classified as short-term.\nChanges in management's estimate of the anticipated exhibitions of films and original series on our networks could result in the earlier recognition of our programming costs than anticipated. Conversely, scheduled exhibitions may not capture the appropriate usage of the program rights in current periods which would lead to the write-off of additional program rights in future periods and may have a significant impact on our future results of operations and our financial position.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue from the theatrical release of feature films is recognized at the time of exhibition based on our participation in box office receipts. Revenue from the sale of DVDs and Blu-ray discs in the retail market, net of an allowance for estimated returns and other allowances, is recognized on the later of receipt by the customer or street date\u201d (when it is available for sale by the customer). Under revenue sharing arrangements, including digital and EST arrangements, such as download-to-own, download-to-rent, video-on-demand, and subscription video-on-demand, revenue is recognized when we are entitled to receipts and such receipts are determinable. Revenues from television or digital licensing for fixed fees are recognized when the feature film or television program is available to the licensee for telecast. For television licenses that include separate availability windows\u201d during the license period, revenue is allocated to the windows\u201d of availability in the arrangement. Revenue from sales to international territories are recognized when access to the feature film or television program has been granted or delivery has occurred, as required under the contract, and the right to exploit the feature film or television program has commenced. For multiple media rights contracts with a fee for a single film or television program where the contract provides for media holdbacks (defined as contractual media release restrictions), the fee is allocated to the various media based on our assessment of the relative fair value of the rights to exploit each media and is recognized as each holdback is released. For multiple-title contracts with a fee, the fee is allocated on a title-by-title basis, based on our assessment of the relative fair value of each title.\nProgramming revenue is recognized in the period during which programming is provided, pursuant to affiliation agreements. If an affiliation agreement has expired and our programming is continuing to be aired by the Distributor, revenue is recognized based on the terms of the expired agreement or the actual payment from the distributor, whichever is less. Payments to distributors for marketing support costs for which Starz does not receive a direct benefit are recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nSales Returns Allowance. Revenues are recorded net of estimated returns and other allowances. We estimate reserves for DVD/Blu-ray returns based on previous returns experience, point-of-sale data available from certain retailers, current economic trends, and projected future sales of the title to the consumer based on the actual performance of similar titles on a title-by-title basis in each of the DVD/Blu-ray businesses. Factors affecting actual returns include, among other factors, limited retail shelf space at various times of the year, success of advertising or other sales promotions, and the near term release of competing titles. We believe that our estimates have been materially accurate in the past; however, due to the judgment involved in establishing reserves, we may have adjustments to our historical estimates in the future. Our estimate of future returns affects reported revenue and operating income. If we underestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amounts. If we overestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record additional revenue in later periods when returns are less than estimated. An incremental change of 1% in our estimated sales returns rate (i.e., provisions for returns divided by gross sales of related product) for home entertainment products would have had an impact of approximately $6.0 million, $7.1 million and $5.4 million on our total revenue in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nProvisions for Accounts Receivable. We estimate provisions for accounts receivable based on historical experience and relevant facts and information regarding the collectability of the accounts receivable. In performing this evaluation, significant judgments and estimates are involved, including an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for our larger customers and an analysis of the length of time receivables have been past due. The financial condition of a given customer and its ability to pay may change over time or could be better or worse than anticipated and could result in an increase or decrease to our allowance for doubtful accounts, which is recorded in direct operating expenses.\nIncome Taxes. We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the U.S., and in several foreign jurisdictions. We record deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences, net of applicable reserves in these jurisdictions. We recognize a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis; otherwise a valuation allowance is applied. In order to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets, we will need to generate sufficient taxable income in the future in each of the jurisdictions which have these deferred tax assets. However, the assessment as to whether there will be sufficient taxable income in a jurisdiction to realize our net deferred tax assets in that jurisdiction is an estimate which could change in the future depending primarily upon the actual performance of our Company. We will be required to continually evaluate the more likely than not assessment that our net deferred tax assets will be realized, and if operating results deteriorate in a particular jurisdiction, we may need to record a valuation allowance for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets through a charge to our income tax provision. Based on our assessment in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we recorded a valuation allowance of $68.2 million against certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets that may not be realized on a more likely than not basis.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was signed into law, making significant changes to the taxation of U.S. business entities. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed a one-time transition tax in connection with the move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, provided for accelerated deductions for certain U.S. film production costs, imposed limitations on certain tax deductions such as executive compensation in future periods, and included numerous other provisions. We are currently in the process of evaluating the full impact of the Tax Act on our financial statements and have not completed this evaluation. We have reported provisional amounts reflecting our reasonable estimates of the impact of the Tax Act. The estimated impact of the Tax Act is based on a preliminary review of the new law and is subject to revision based upon further analysis and interpretation of the Tax Act.\nOur effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate and are affected by many factors, including the overall level of pre-tax income, mix of our pre-tax income generated across the various jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in tax laws and regulations in those jurisdictions, further interpretation and legislative guidance regarding the new Tax Act, changes in valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, tax planning strategies available to us and other discrete items.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment each fiscal year or between the annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We perform our annual impairment test as of January 1 in each fiscal year. We performed our last annual impairment test on our goodwill as of January 1, 2018 by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there was a potential goodwill impairment. Based on our qualitative assessments, including but not limited to, the results of our most recent quantitative impairment test, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cash flows, and changes in our share price, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value.\nConsolidation. We consolidate entities in which we own more than 50% of the voting common stock and control operations and also variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. Investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own more than 20% of the voting common stock or otherwise exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but not control of the nonconsolidated affiliate, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own less than 20% of the voting common stock are accounted for using the cost method of accounting.\nBusiness Combinations. We account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value. Goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired, net of assumed liabilities. Determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives among other items.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Due to the Starz Merger, fiscal 2017 includes the results of operations from Starz from the acquisition date of December 8, 2016. Revenue from Starz across all segments was $1.65 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $483.2 million for the period from the acquisition date of December 8, 2016 to March 31, 2017.\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Consolidated revenues increased in fiscal 2018, due to the inclusion of Starz revenue for the entire fiscal year, as compared to the period from the acquisition date of December 8, 2016 to March 31, 2017 in fiscal 2017, offset partially by decreases in Motion Pictures revenues and, to a lesser extent, Television Production revenues. The Media Networks and Motion Pictures revenues in fiscal 2018 include $1,525.4 million and $126.4 million, respectively, of revenues from Starz, as compared to $453.7 million and $29.5 million, respectively, in fiscal 2017 from the date of acquisition.\nThe decrease in Motion Pictures revenue was primarily due to decreases in theatrical and international revenue driven by our smaller theatrical slate (15 feature films released in fiscal 2018 compared to 18 in fiscal 2017). In addition, fiscal 2017 included significant theatrical and international contributions from La La Land, Now You See Me 2 and Deepwater Horizon. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in Motion Pictures home entertainment revenue, driven by a greater contribution in fiscal 2018 from the Starz third party distribution business as a result of the Starz Merger.\nA significant component of revenue comes from home entertainment.

Gain on Starz investment in fiscal 2017 of $20.4 million represents the difference between the fair value of the Starz available-for-sale securities on the date of the Starz Merger (December 8, 2016) and the original cost of the previously held Starz available-for-sale securities, with no comparable gain in fiscal 2018.\nImpairment of Long-Term Investments and Other Assets. During fiscal 2018, we recognized $29.2 million of other-than-temporary impairments on our investments and notes receivable (included in other assets), which were written down to their estimated fair value (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements). There was no comparable charge in fiscal 2017.\nEquity Interests Income (Loss). The following table represents our portion of the income or (loss) of our equity method investees based on our percentage ownership for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Ownership Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EPIX(1)(2)\n</td> <td>n/a(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pop(2)\n</td> <td>50.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(3)\n</td> <td>Various\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(52.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\n (1) In May 2017, we sold all of our 31.15% equity interest in EPIX to MGM (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements). \n (2) We license certain of our theatrical releases and other films and television programs to EPIX and Pop. A portion of the profits of these licenses reflecting our ownership share in the venture is eliminated through an adjustment to the equity interest income (loss) of Pop and EPIX (through the date of sale of our ownership interest of May 11, 2017). These profits are recognized as they are realized by the venture (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements). \n (3) Other primarily consists of equity interest losses from our equity method interests in Laugh Out Loud, Playco, Atom Tickets and Defy Media Group in fiscal 2018, compared to equity interest losses from our equity method interest in Atom Tickets and Playco in fiscal 2017. \nIncome Tax Benefit. We had an income tax benefit of $319.4 million in fiscal 2018, compared to a benefit of $148.9 million in fiscal 2017. Our income tax benefit differs from the federal statutory rate multiplied by pre-tax income (loss) due to the mix of our pre-tax income (loss) generated across the various jurisdictions in which we operate and the tax deductions generated by our capital structure, which includes a favorable permanent book-tax difference in our Canadian jurisdiction for certain foreign affiliate dividends. Canadian tax law permits such dividends to be received without being subject to tax. In addition, our total income tax benefit of $319.4 million in fiscal 2018 includes a net benefit of $259.1 million, consisting of a $165.0 million benefit from the impact of the change in U.S. federal tax rates (see below) on our beginning net deferred tax liability balances, a benefit of $162.3 million primarily for foreign affiliate dividends resulting from an internal capital restructuring in connection with our third party debt refinancing (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements), offset by charges of $58.8 million and $9.4 million from increases in our valuation allowance associated with certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, respectively, that may not be realized on a more likely than not basis. The impact is reflected in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in the table that reconciles income taxes computed at U.S. statutory income tax rates to the income tax provision (benefit).\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was signed into law, making significant changes to the taxation of U.S. business entities. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed a one-time transition tax in connection with the move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, changed the ability to claim certain tax deductions, and included numerous other provisions. As we have a March 31 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 31.5% for our fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, and 21% for subsequent fiscal years. Since we are not in a current U.S federal tax paying position for fiscal 2018, our U.S. tax provision consists primarily of deferred tax benefits calculated at the 21% tax rate. Due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, we recorded a $165.0 million income tax benefit from the reduction of our beginning net U.S. deferred tax liabilities in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, which was considered a provisional amount based on reasonable estimates.\nWe have also made provisional estimates of other effects of the Tax Act, such as the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to executive compensation, the one-time transition tax, net operating loss carryovers, foreign tax credits, and accelerated deductions for U.S. film costs. We are currently in the process of evaluating the full impact of the Tax Act on our financial statements and have not completed this evaluation. We have reported provisional amounts reflecting our reasonable estimates of the impact of the Tax Act. The estimated impact of the Tax Act is based on a preliminary review of the new law and is subject to revision based upon further analysis and interpretation of the Tax Act. We will complete our accounting for the Tax Act once we have obtained, prepared, and analyzed all information needed (including computations) for our analysis, but no later than one year from the enactment date of the Tax Act.\nAt March 31, 2018, we had U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1,260.5 million available to reduce\nfuture federal income taxes which expire beginning in 2029 through 2038, state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $712.8 million available to reduce future state income taxes which expire in varying amounts beginning 2021, and Canadian loss carryforwards of $132.5 million, which will expire beginning in 2034. In addition, at March 31, 2018, we had U.S. credit carryforwards related to foreign taxes paid of approximately $68.3 million to offset future federal income taxes that will expire beginning in 2021.\nNet Income Attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Shareholders. Net income attributable to our shareholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 was $473.6 million, or basic net income per common share of $2.27 on 208.4 million weighted average common shares outstanding and diluted net income per common share of $2.15 on 220.4 million weighted average common shares outstanding. This compares to net income attributable to our shareholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 of $14.8 million, or basic net income per common share of $0.09 on 165.0 million weighted average common shares outstanding and diluted net income per common share of $0.09 on 172.2 million weighted average common shares outstanding.\nSegment Results of Operations\nThe segment results of operations presented below do not include the elimination of intersegment transactions which are eliminated when presenting consolidated results, and exclude items separately identified in the restructuring and other line item in the consolidated statement of operations.\nMotion Pictures\nThe table below sets forth Motion Pictures gross contribution and segment profit for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Motion Pictures Segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,822.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,920.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(98.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense\n</td> <td>977.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>976.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution & marketing expense\n</td> <td>551.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>706.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(154.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution\n</td> <td>292.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>237.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>113.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. theatrical P&A expense included in distribution and marketing expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>319.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>474.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(155.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>53.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>16.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue.

This category also includes certain specialty theatrical releases with our equity method investee, Pantelion Films, and other titles. \n (3) Digital Media Revenue: Consists of revenues generated from pay-per-view and video-on-demand platforms, EST, and digital rental.  Theatrical revenue decreased $89.9 million, or 24.2%, in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, due to a smaller theatrical slate and the performance of the Feature Films released, which included a significant contribution in fiscal 2017 from La La Land.\nHome entertainment revenue increased $66.3 million, or 9.4%, in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily driven by increased home entertainment revenue from Other Than Feature Film of $86.5 million, partially offset by a decrease of $20.2 million of home entertainment revenue from our Feature Films. The increase in home entertainment revenue from Other Than Feature Film was driven by increased revenue from the Starz third party distribution business in fiscal 2018 (increase of $91.4 million as compared to fiscal 2017). The decrease in home entertainment revenue from our Feature Films was driven by lower packaged media revenue in fiscal 2018 from the smaller Fiscal 2018 theatrical slate, as compared to the packaged media revenue in fiscal 2017 from the Fiscal 2017 theatrical slate, partially offset by higher digital media revenue in fiscal 2018 from our Fiscal 2017 theatrical slate.\nInternational motion pictures revenue decreased $77.1 million, or 14.4%, in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, driven by our smaller Fiscal 2018 theatrical slate, and significant contributions in fiscal 2017 from Now You See Me 2 and Deepwater Horizon.\nDirect Operating Expense. The increase in direct operating expenses as a percentage of motion pictures revenue was primarily driven by the change in the mix of titles and product categories generating revenue in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, and an increase in investment in film write-downs. Included in Motion Pictures direct operating expenses are investment in film write-downs of approximately $33.6 million in fiscal 2018, compared to approximately $17.0 million in fiscal 2017.\nDistribution and Marketing Expense. The decrease in distribution and marketing expense in fiscal 2018 is primarily due to lower theatrical P&A, driven by lower P&A spending in fiscal 2018 on fewer Feature Film theatrical releases. In fiscal 2018, approximately $10.3 million of P&A was incurred in advance for films to be released in fiscal 2019, such as Uncle Drew, Traffik and The Spy Who Dumped Me. In fiscal 2017, approximately $1.9 million of P&A was incurred in advance for films to be released in fiscal 2018, such as All Eyez on Me, How to Be a Latin Lover and American Assassin.\nGross Contribution. Gross contribution and gross contribution margin of the Motion Pictures segment for fiscal 2018 increased as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to lower U.S. theatrical P&A as a percentage of Motion Pictures revenue due to lower P&A spending on the fewer number of Feature Film releases in the current fiscal year, offset partially by higher direct operating expenses as a percentage of Motion Pictures revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses of the Motion Pictures segment increased $7.9 million, or 7.5%, primarily due to increases in salaries and related expenses and incentive compensation.\nTelevision Production\nThe table below sets forth Television Production gross contribution and segment profit for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Television Production Segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>805.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>837.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense\n</td> <td>668.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>711.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution & marketing expense\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution\n</td> <td>107.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>40.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>83.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue.
