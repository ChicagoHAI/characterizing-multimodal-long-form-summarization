MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally are indicated by words such as expects,\u201d intends,\u201d anticipates,\u201d plans,\u201d believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d will\u201d or words of similar meaning, and include, without limitation, statements regarding the outlook of our business and expected financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to changes and uncertainties which are, in many instances, beyond our control and have been made based upon our assumptions, expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect upon us. There can be no assurance that future developments will be in accordance with our expectations, or that the effect of future developments on us will be as anticipated. It is not a matter of corporate policy for us to make specific projections relating to future earnings, and we do not endorse any projections regarding future performance made by others. Additionally, we do not publicly update or revise forward-looking statements based on the outcome of various foreseeable or unforeseeable events. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve various risks and uncertainties. There are certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements, including without limitation risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. Management's discussion and analysis ( MD&A\u201d) of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOverview\nChartered in 1905, we are a diversified insurance and financial services company offering a broad spectrum of insurance products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our headquarters are in Galveston, Texas.\nOur business has been and will continue to be influenced by a number of industry-wide, segment or product-specific trends and conditions. In our discussion below, we first outline the broad macro-economic or industry trends (General Trends) that we expect to impact our overall business. Second, we discuss certain segment-specific trends we believe may impact individual segments or specific products within these segments.\nSegments\nThe insurance segments do not directly own assets. Rather, assets are allocated to support the liabilities and capital allocated to each segment. The mix of assets allocated to each of the insurance segments is intended to support the characteristics of the insurance liabilities within each segment including expected cash flows and pricing assumptions, and is intended to be sufficient to support each segment's business activities. We have utilized this methodology consistently over all periods presented.\nThe Corporate and Other segment acts as the owner of all of the invested assets of the Company. The investment income from the invested assets is allocated to the insurance segments in accordance with the assets allocated to each insurance segment. Earnings of the Corporate and Other segment are derived from income related to invested assets not allocated to the insurance segments and from our non-insurance businesses. All realized investment gains and losses, which includes other-than-temporary impairments ( OTTI\u201d), are recorded in this segment.\nGeneral Trends\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are materially affected by economic and financial market conditions. The U.S. and global economies, as well as the capital markets, continue to show mixed signals, and uncertainties continue to be significant factors in the markets in which we operate. Factors such as consumer spending, business investment, the volatility of the capital markets, the level of interest rates, unemployment, the level of participation in the workforce and the risk of inflation or deflation will affect the business and economic environment and, in turn, impact the demand for the type of financial and insurance products we offer. Adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe those risks are somewhat mitigated by our financial strength, active enterprise risk management and disciplined underwriting for our products. Our diverse product mix and distribution channels across insurance segments is a strength that we expect will help us adapt to the volatile economic environment and give us the ability to serve the changing needs of our customers. Additionally, through our long-term business approach, we believe we are financially strong, and we are committed to providing a steady and reliable source of financial protection for policyholders.\nInterest Rates: The low-interest rate environment is a challenge for life insurers as the spreads on deposit-type contracts remain narrow, especially as interest rates have approached minimum crediting rates. Low market interest rates reduce the spreads between the amounts we credit to fixed annuity and individual life policyholders and the amounts we earn on the investments that support these obligations. Our ALM Committee actively manages the profitability of our in-force blocks. In previous years, we reduced the guaranteed minimum crediting rates on new fixed annuity contracts, which has afforded us the flexibility to respond to the unusually low-interest rate environment. In previous years, we also reduced crediting rates on in-force contracts, where permitted to do so. These actions help mitigate the adverse impact of low interest rates on the profitability of these products, although sales volume may be negatively impacted as a result. We also maintain assets with various maturities to support product liabilities and ensure liquidity. A gradual increase in longer-term interest rates relative to short-term rates generally will have a favorable effect on the profitability of our products. Rapidly rising interest rates could result in reduced persistency of our spread-based products, if contract holders shift assets into higher yielding investments. We believe our ability to react quickly to the changing marketplace will help us manage this risk.\nThe interest rate environment affects estimated future profit projections, which could impact the amortization of our DAC assets and the estimates of policyholder liabilities. Significantly lower future estimated profits may cause us to accelerate the amortization of DAC or require us to establish additional policyholder liabilities, thereby reducing earnings. We periodically review assumptions with respect to future earnings to make sure that they remain appropriate considering the current interest rate environment.\nLow interest rates are also challenging for property and casualty insurers. Investment income is an important element in earning an acceptable return on capital. Lower interest rates resulting in lower investment income require us to achieve better underwriting results. We have adjusted policy prices to help mitigate the adverse impact of low interest rates on our property and casualty business.\nChanging Regulatory Environment: The insurance industry is primarily regulated at the state level, although some life and annuity products and services are also subject to U.S. federal regulation. We are regularly subjected to additional or changing regulation that requires us to update systems, change product structure, increase the amount of reporting or adopt changes to distribution. These changes may increase the capital requirements for us and the industry, increase operating costs, change our operating practices and change our ability to provide products with pricing attractive to the marketplace.\nImportance of Operating Efficiencies: The volatile economic environment and costs associated with greater regulation create a further need for operating efficiencies. We manage our cost base while maintaining our commitment to provide superior customer service to policyholders and agents. Investments in technology are coordinated through a disciplined project management process. We anticipate continually improving our use of technology to enhance our policyholders' and agents' experience and increase efficiency of our employees.\nIncreased Role of Advanced Technology: The use of mobile technology has changed the way consumers want to conduct their business, including real-time access to information. Many customers expect to complete transactions in a digital format instead of traditional methods that require a phone call or submission of paper forms. Social media and other customer-facing technologies also reshape the way companies communicate and collaborate with key stakeholders, and new tools exist to better collect and analyze information for potential business opportunities and better manage risks. For example, American National has mobile-enabled all of its Internet-based access and leverages social media channels to reach out to potential customers to promote awareness of the company, including the products and services offered. We expect that technology will continue to evolve, offering new and more effective ways to reach and service our customers and shareholders. We evaluate available and evolving technologies and incorporate those that we believe offer appropriate benefits to the company and its customers.\nIncreased Challenges of Talent Attraction and Retention: Attracting qualified individuals and retaining existing employees is a challenge for all employers. Businesses have become extremely competitive in the talent marketplace, and with such low unemployment today, it has become a candidate's job market. Combined with the increasing impact of social media it is easier than ever for companies to find individuals with needed job skills and lure them away from their current positions. As a result, the ability to distinguish American National as the employer of choice grows increasingly challenging.\nOur expanded use of technology, particularly our new recruiting-marketing platform combined with greater use of social media, is intended to enhance our employer brand and educate candidates on why they should work for us. Our ongoing efforts to develop a diverse and inclusive workforce not only strengthens the engagement of our current employee population but helps make us an attractive employer where differing insights and opinions are valued. Valuing different perspectives and the impact of broader employee influence on how decisions are made, are two areas for the company to focus on for successful retention. Providing for robust career development opportunities and effective succession planning is expected to be another important part of our retention efforts.\nLife and Annuity\nLife insurance and annuity are mainstay segments, as they have been during our long history. We believe that the combination of predictable and decreasing mortality rates, positive cash flow generation for many years after policy issue and favorable persistency characteristics suggest a viable and profitable future for these lines of business.\nEffective management of invested assets and associated liabilities using crediting rates and, where applicable, financial hedging instruments (which we use as economic hedges of equity-indexed life and annuity products), is important to the success of our life and annuity segments. Asset disintermediation\u201d, the risk of large outflows of cash at times when it is disadvantageous to us to dispose of invested assets, is a risk associated with these segments.\nDemographics: We believe a key driver shaping the actions of the life insurance industry is the rising income protection, wealth accumulation and insurance needs of retiring Baby Boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964). As a result of increasing longevity and uncertainty regarding the Social Security System and an ongoing transition from defined benefit pension plans to 401(k) type retirement plans, retirees will need to accumulate sufficient savings to support retirement income requirements.\nWe believe we are well positioned to address the Baby Boomers' increasing need for savings tools and income protection. We believe that our overall financial strength and broad distribution channels position us to respond with a variety of products for individuals approaching retirement age, who seek information to plan for and manage their retirement needs. We believe our products that offer guaranteed income flows for life, including single premium immediate annuities, are well positioned to serve this market.\nCompetitive Pressures: In recent years, the competitive landscape of the U.S. life insurance industry has shifted. Established insurers are competing against each other and also against new market entrants that are developing products to attract the interest of the growing number of retirees. Competition exists in terms of retaining and acquiring consumers' business and also in terms of access to producers and distributors. Consolidation among distributors coupled with the aging sales force remains a challenge among insurers. In addition, the increased technological sophistication of consumers necessitates that insurers and distributors invest significant resources in technology to adapt to consumer expectations. We believe we possess sufficient scale, financial strength, resources and flexibility to compete effectively.\nThe annuity market is also highly competitive. In addition to aggressive interest crediting rates and new product features on annuities, there is competition from other financial service firms. Insurers continue to evaluate their distribution channels and the way they deliver products to consumers.\nWe believe we will continue to be competitive in the life and annuity markets through our broad line of products, diverse distribution channels, and consistent high level of customer service. We modify our products to meet customer needs and to expand our reach where we believe we can obtain profitable growth.\nHealth\nMost of the major provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and a reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Healthcare Acts\u201d), phased in effective January 1, 2014. The Healthcare Acts mandated broad changes in the delivery of health care benefits that have impacted our business model including our relationships with current and future customers, producers, and health care providers, as well as our products, services and processes. As a result, the Healthcare Acts generated new opportunities in the limited benefit and supplemental product markets. In recent years, we built a portfolio of such products to be sold in the worksite market as well as to individuals. We feel that recent changes to the Healthcare Acts that removed the tax consequences for not having health coverage and the removal of limitations on Short Term Medical products could significantly increase our production. We also continue to expand our presence in the worksite market to generate new opportunities in the broker market, as well as developing and implementing a captive sales force.\nWe expect our Managing General Underwriter ( MGU\u201d) business to remain stable during 2019. We generally retain only 10% of the MGU premium and risk. The majority of the revenue generated from this business is fee income included in Other income\u201d of the Health segment's operating results.\nProperty and Casualty\nWe offer our personal and commercial property and casualty lines of business primarily through exclusive agents. We favor a balanced, focused and collaborative approach to both growth and profitability through the development of successful agencies.\nTo acquire and retain profitable business, we use sophisticated pricing models and risk segmentation, along with a focused distribution force. We believe this approach allows us to make product enhancements and offer programs that are tailored to our target markets while charging an appropriate premium for the risk.\nDemand for property and casualty credit-related insurance products continues to increase. We continue to update credit-related insurance product offerings and pricing to meet changing market needs, as well as adding new agents to expand market share in the credit-related insurance market. We are reviewing and implementing procedures to enhance customer service while, at the same time, looking for efficiencies to reduce administrative costs.\nCompetition: The property and casualty insurance industry remains highly competitive. Despite the competitive environment, we expect to identify profitable opportunities through our strong distribution channels, expanding geographic coverage, marketing efforts, new product development and pricing sophistication.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that often involve a significant degree of judgment. These estimates and judgments include expectations of current and future mortality, morbidity, persistency, claims and claim adjustment expenses, recoverability of receivables, investment returns and interest rates which extend well into the future. In developing these estimates, there is inherent uncertainty, and material changes to facts and circumstances may develop. Although variability is inherent in these estimates, we believe the amounts as reported are appropriate, based upon the facts available upon compilation of the consolidated financial statements.\nOn an ongoing basis, management reviews the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the financial statements. If current facts and circumstances warrant modifications in estimates and assumptions, our financial position and results of operations as reported in the consolidated financial statements could change significantly.\nA description of these critical accounting estimates is presented below. Also, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nReserves\nLife and Annuity Reserves\nLife Reserving-Principal assumptions used in the determination of the reserves for future policy benefits are mortality, policy lapse rates, investment return, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type. Reserves for incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) claims on life policies are calculated using historical claims information. Reserves for interest-sensitive and variable universal life insurance policies are equal to the current account value calculated for the policyholder. Some of our universal life policies contain secondary guarantees, for which additional reserves are recorded based on the term of the policy.\nAnnuity Reserving-Reserves for payout annuities with more than insignificant amounts of mortality risk are calculated in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for limited pay insurance contracts. Benefit and maintenance expense reserves are calculated by using assumptions reflecting our expectations of future costs, including an appropriate margin for adverse deviation. These assumptions are locked-in at issue and generally reflect pricing assumptions from that period. If the resulting reserve would otherwise cause profits to be recognized at the issue date, additional reserves are recorded. The resulting recognition of profits would be gradual over the expected life of the contract.\nReserves for fixed deferred annuities are established equivalent to the account value held on behalf of the policyholder. Reserves for indexed annuities are calculated in accordance with derivative accounting guidance which defines a host liability for return of principal and guaranteed interest, and an embedded derivative liability for funded benefits in excess of the host guarantee. Additional reserves for benefits that can exceed contract fund value, such as lifetime income riders, are determined as needed in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The profit recognition on deferred annuity contracts is gradual over the expected life of the contract. No immediate profit is recognized on the sale of the contract.\nKey Assumptions-The following assumptions reflect our best estimates and may impact our life and annuity reserves:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Future lapse rates will remain reasonably consistent with our current expectations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Mortality rates will remain reasonably consistent within standard industry mortality table ranges; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Future interest spreads will remain reasonably consistent with our current expectations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecoverability-At least annually, we test the adequacy of the net benefit reserves (policy benefit reserves less DAC) recorded for life insurance and annuity products. To perform the tests, we use our current best-estimate assumptions as to policyholder mortality, persistency, maintenance expenses and invested asset returns.\nFor interest-sensitive business, best-estimate assumptions are updated to reflect observed changes based on experience studies and current economic conditions. We reflect the effect of such assumption changes in DAC and reserve balances accordingly. Due to the long-term nature of many of the liabilities, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in profitability. In particular, changes in estimates of the future invested asset return have a large effect on the degree of reserve adequacy and DAC recoverability.\nFor traditional business, a lock-in\u201d principle applies, whereby the assumptions used to calculate the benefit reserves and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience. These include margins for adverse deviation in the event that actual experience differs from the original assumptions.\nHealth Reserves\nHealth reserves are established using the following methods:\nCompletion Factor Approach-This method assumes that the historical claim patterns will be an accurate representation of unpaid claim liabilities. An estimate of the unpaid claims is calculated by subtracting period-to-date paid claims from an estimate of the ultimate complete\u201d payment for all incurred claims in the period. Completion factors are calculated which complete\u201d the current period-to-date payment totals for each incurred month to estimate the ultimate expected payout.\nTabular Claims Reserves-This method is used to calculate the reserves for disability income blocks of business. These reserves rely on published valuation continuance tables created using industry experience regarding assumptions of continued morbidity and subsequent recovery. Reserves are calculated by applying these continuance tables, along with appropriate company experience adjustments, to the stream of contractual benefit payments. These expected benefit payments are discounted at the required interest rate.\nFuture Policy Benefits-Reserves are equal to the aggregate of the present value of expected future benefit payments, less the present value of expected future premiums. Morbidity and termination assumptions are based on our experience or published valuation tables when available and appropriate.\nPremium Deficiency Reserves-Deficiency reserves are established when the expected future claim payments and expenses for a classification of policies are in excess of the expected premiums for these policies. The determination of a deficiency reserve takes into consideration the likelihood of premium rate increases, the timing of these increases, and the expected benefit utilization patterns. We have established premium deficiency reserves for portions of the major medical business and the long-term care business that are in run-off. The assumptions and methods used to determine the deficiency reserves are reviewed periodically for reasonableness, and the reserve amount is monitored against emerging losses.\nProperty and Casualty Reserves\nReserves for Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense ( CAE\u201d)-Property and casualty reserves are established to provide for the estimated cost of settling and paying both reported ( case\u201d) as well as incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) claims. The two major categories of CAE are defense and cost containment expense, and adjusting and other expense. The details of property and casualty reserves are shown below (in thousands):\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ceded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ceded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Case\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>858,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>800,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>544,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>481,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IBNR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>409,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>382,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>990,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>921,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>953,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>864,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCase Reserves-Reserves for reported losses are determined on either a judgment or a formula basis, depending on the timing and type of the loss. The formula reserve is a fixed amount for each claim of a given type based on historical paid loss data for similar claims with a provision for claim inflation. Judgment reserve amounts replace initial formula reserves and are set for each loss based on facts and circumstances of each case and the expectation of damages. We regularly monitor the adequacy of reserves on a case-by-case basis and change the amount of such reserves as necessary.\nIBNR-IBNR reserves are estimated based on many variables including: historical statistical information, inflation, legal environment, economic conditions, trends in claim severity and frequency as well as other factors affecting the adequacy of claim reserves. Loss and premium data is aggregated by exposure class and by accident year. IBNR reserves are estimated by projecting ultimate losses on each class of business and subtracting paid losses and case reserves. Our overall reserve practice provides for ongoing claims evaluation and adjustment based on the development of related data and other relevant information pertaining to claims. Adjustments in aggregate reserves, if any, are included in the results of operations of the period during which such adjustments are made.\nWe believe we conservatively reflect the potential uncertainty generated by volatility in our loss development profiles when selecting loss development factor patterns for each line of business. See Note 12, Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe evaluation process to determine reserves involves the collaboration of underwriting, claims and actuarial departments. The process also includes consultation with independent actuarial firms as part of our process of gaining reassurance that claims and CAE reserves estimate sufficiently, all obligations arising from all losses incurred as of year-end. The independent actuarial firm completes the Statements of Actuarial Opinion required by individual state insurance regulations at each year-end, opining that the recorded statutory claims and CAE reserves are reasonable.\nPremium Deficiency Reserve-Deficiency reserves are recorded when the expected claims payments and policy maintenance costs for a product line exceed the expected premiums for that product line. The estimation of a deficiency reserve considers the current profitability of a product line using anticipated claims, CAE, and policy maintenance costs. The assumptions and methods used to determine the need for deficiency reserves are reviewed periodically for reasonableness. There were no reserves of this type at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nProperty and Casualty Reserving Methodology-The following methods are utilized:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Initial Expected Loss Ratio-This method calculates an estimate of ultimate losses by applying an estimated loss ratio to actual earned premium for each calendar/accident year.

This method is generally appropriate where there are few reported claims and an unstable pattern of reported losses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Loss or Expense Development (Chain Ladder)-This method uses actual loss or defense and cost containment expense data and the historical development profiles on older accident periods to project more recent, less developed periods to their ultimate total. This method is appropriate when there is a relatively stable pattern of loss and expense emergence and a relatively large number of reported claims.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Ratio of Paid Defense and Cost Containment Expense to Paid Loss Development-This method uses the ratio of paid defense and cost containment expense to paid loss data and the historical development profiles on older accident periods to project more recent, less developed periods to their ultimate total. In this method, an ultimate ratio of paid defense and cost containment expense to paid loss is selected for each accident period. The selected paid defense and cost containment expense to paid loss ratio is then applied to the selected ultimate loss for each accident period to estimate the ultimate defense and cost containment expense. Paid defense and cost containment expense is then subtracted from the ultimate defense and cost containment expense to calculate the unpaid defense and cost containment expense for that accident period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Calendar Year Paid Adjusting and Other Expense to Paid Loss-This method uses a selected prior calendar years' paid expense to paid loss ratio to project ultimate loss adjustment expenses for adjusting and other expense. A percentage of the selected ratio is applied to the case reserves (depending on the line of insurance) and 100% to the indicated IBNR reserves. These ratios assume that a percentage of the expense is incurred when a claim is opened and the remaining percentage is paid throughout the claim's life.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe basis of our selected single point best estimate on a particular line of business is often a blended result from two or more methods (e.g. weighted averages). Our estimate is highly dependent on actuarial and management judgment as to which method(s) is most appropriate for a particular accident year and class of business. Our methodology changes over time, as new information emerges regarding underlying loss activity and other factors.\nKey Assumptions-The following assumptions may impact our property and casualty reserves:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Stability of future inflation rates and consistency with historical inflation norms;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The expected loss development patterns;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Consistent claims handling, reserving and payment processes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>No unusual growth patterns or unexpected changes in the mix of business; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>No significant prospective changes in laws that would significantly affect future payouts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The loss ratio selections and development profiles are developed primarily using our historical claims and loss experience. These development patterns reflect prior inflation rates, and could be impacted by future changes in inflation rates, particularly those relating to medical care costs, automobile repair parts and building or home material costs. These assumptions have not been modified from the preceding periods and are consistent with historical loss reserve development patterns.\nFor non-credit lines of business, future inflation rates could vary from our assumption of relatively stable rates. Unexpected changes in future inflation rates could impact our financial position and liquidity, and we measure the sensitivity of our reserve levels to unexpected changes in inflation. The impacts of future inflation for a 1.0% decrease and 3.0% increase over the implied inflation rate in the December 31, 2018 gross loss reserve balance are as follows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cumulative Increase (Decrease) in Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0% Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0% Increase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automobile\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,038\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Homeowner\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,578\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agricultural Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,544\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automobile\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,799\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe analysis of our credit insurance lines of business quantifies the estimated impact on gross loss reserves of a reasonably likely scenario of varying the ratio applied to the earned premium to determine the IBNR reserves at December 31, 2018. IBNR reserving methodology for this line of business focuses primarily on the use of a ratio applied to the unearned premium for each credit insurance product. The selected ratios are based on historical loss and claim data. In our analysis, we varied this ratio by +/- 5% across all credit insurance products combined. The results of our analysis show an increase or decrease in gross reserves across all accident years combined of approximately $10.1 million.\nIt is not appropriate to aggregate the impacts shown in our sensitivity analysis, as our lines of business are not directly correlated. The variations are not meant to be a best-case\u201d or worst-case\u201d scenario, and it is possible that future variations will be more or less than the amounts in the sensitivity analysis. While these are possible scenarios based on the information available to us at this time, we do not believe the reader should consider our sensitivity analysis an actual reserve range.\nManagement believes our reserves at December 31, 2018 are adequate. New information, regulation, events or circumstances unknown at the original valuation date, however, may result in future development resulting in ultimate losses being significantly greater or less than the recorded reserves at December 31, 2018.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nWe had a DAC asset of approximately $1.50 billion and $1.37 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 10, Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nWe believe the estimates used in our DAC calculations provide an example of how variations in assumptions and estimates would affect our business. The following table displays the sensitivity of reasonably likely changes in assumptions in the DAC amortization for our long-tail business at December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease) in DAC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in future investment margins of 25 basis points\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in future investment margins of 25 basis points\n</td> <td>(39,335\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in future life mortality by 1%\n</td> <td>1,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in future life mortality by 1%\n</td> <td>(1,520\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReinsurance\nWe manage our insurance underwriting risk exposures by purchasing reinsurance. We manage counterparty risk by entering into agreements with reinsurers we consider creditworthy, generally measured by the individual entity or entities' financial strength rating. However, we do not require a specified minimum rating. We monitor the concentrations of the reinsurers and reduce the participation percentage of lower-rated and unrated companies when appropriate in our judgment. While we believe we currently have no significant credit risk related to reinsurance counterparties, we continue to monitor their financial condition.\nSome of our reinsurance contracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate the participation with reinsurers whose ratings are downgraded. Information used in our risk assessment is comprised of industry ratings, recent news and reports, and a limited review of financial statements. We also may require reinsurers not licensed in our state of domicile or with whom we have limited experience, to provide letters of credit, trust agreements, or cash advances to fund their share of reserves.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment\nA decline in the fair value of fixed maturity investment securities below their cost basis is evaluated on an ongoing basis to determine if the decline is other-than-temporary. A number of assumptions and estimates inherent in evaluating impairments are used to determine if they are other-than-temporary, which include 1) our ability and intent to hold the investment securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; 2) the expected recoverability of principal and interest; 3) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost basis; 4) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; and 5) the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position, including market conditions, which could affect liquidity.\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities is determined by management using one of the three primary sources of information: the quoted prices in active markets; third-party pricing services; or independent broker quotations. Estimated fair value of securities based on quoted prices in active markets is readily and regularly available; therefore, valuation of these securities generally does not involve management judgment. For securities without quoted prices, fair value measurement is determined using third-party pricing services' proprietary pricing applications. Typical inputs used by the models are relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmark pricing of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. Any securities remaining unpriced after utilizing the first two pricing methods are submitted to independent brokers for prices. We have analyzed the third-party pricing services and independent brokers' valuation methodologies and related inputs, and have evaluated the various types of securities in our investment portfolio to determine an appropriate fair value hierarchy level based upon trading activity and the observability of market inputs. Management completes certain tests throughout the year and at year-end to determine that prices provided by our pricing services are reasonable.\nWe utilize over-the-counter equity options to hedge our exposure to equity-indexed universal life and equity-indexed deferred annuity benefits, and the fair values for these options are sourced from broker quotations. Accounting guidance requires a fair value calculation as part of equity-indexed policy reserves. This is called the value of embedded derivative (or VED) and the other part of the indexed policy reserve is called the host reserve. The embedded derivative represents future benefit cash flows in excess of minimum guarantee cash flows. The host covers the minimum guarantee cash flows. Both the VED and the host reserve are calculated by a vendor-sourced reserve valuation system. The VED calculation model incorporates assumptions related to current option pricing (such as implied volatility and LIBOR/swap curve), future policyholder behavior (such as surrenders and withdrawals), and factors affecting the value of future indexed interest periods (such as option budgets).\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe Company has frozen each of its defined benefit pension plans. Our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related costs covering our employees are estimated using actuarial concepts in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. The discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense and/or liability measurements. Each year, these key assumptions are reevaluated to determine whether they reflect the best estimates for the current period. Changes in the methodology used to determine the best estimates are made when facts or circumstances change. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined using the building-block method which is described further in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices, Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans. In 2017, the Company commenced a one-time window offering to terminated, vested participants of our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The offer allowed participants to take a lump sum or annuity payout which was funded from pension plan assets. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18, Pension and Postretirement Benefits for additional details.\nLitigation Contingencies\nBased on information currently available, we believe that amounts ultimately paid, if any, arising from existing and currently potential litigation would not have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. However, it should be noted that the frequency of large damage awards, which bear little or no relation to the economic damages incurred by plaintiffs, continues to create the potential for an unpredictable judgment in any given lawsuit. It is possible that, if the defenses in these lawsuits are not successful, and the judgments are greater than we anticipate, the resulting liability could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nFederal Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is based on income at statutory tax rates, adjusted for non-taxable and non-deductible items, and tax credits. Management's best estimate of future events and their impact is included in our effective tax rate. Certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, and completion of tax audits could have an impact on our estimates and effective tax rate. Audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed.\nGAAP requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, and if so, the amount of such valuation allowance. There were no material valuation allowances recorded during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that our remaining deferred tax assets will be realized and that no additional valuation allowance is necessary as of December 31, 2018.\nOn December 22, 2017, the federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Reform\u201d). Tax Reform made broad and complex changes to federal corporate tax law and resulted in changes to our overall tax obligations. Most notably, Tax Reform reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Other provisions affecting corporations include, but are not limited to, changes to the deductibility of interest expense, limitations on certain deductions for executive compensation and the repeal of the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. In addition, there were several changes that are specific to insurance companies, namely changes to the proration formula used to determine the amount of dividends eligible for the dividends-received deduction, and changes to the calculation of tax reserves associated with policyholder liabilities.\nSubsequent to enactment, the Securities Exchange Commission introduced Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d). SAB 118 provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the Tax Reform where our determinations were incomplete but we were able to determine a reasonable estimate. A final determination is required to be made within a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment of Tax Reform. In 2017, we recorded a provisional tax benefit of $206.4 million in accordance with the guidance in SAB 118. As a result of Tax Reform, we remeasured our existing deferred tax balances to the new 21% corporate income tax rate. Additionally, we made a reasonable estimate to evaluate the impact of Tax Reform on our 2017 financial statements. There were no adjustments in 2018 to the provisional tax benefit we recorded in 2017.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following sets forth the consolidated results of operations (in

to 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of net unrealized losses on equity securities in income as required by new accounting guidance. The earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018 were also impacted by a reduced interest margin resulting from a decrease in the S&P 500 index on equity-indexed products in our Annuity segment as well as losses impacting our homeowners, commercial auto and GAP lines of business in our Property and Casualty segment. Earnings increased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in net investment income and realized investment gains. The increase in net investment income was attributable to increased income on mortgage loans. The increase in realized investment gains was attributable to an increase in the sale of bonds, equity securities, and certain real estate holdings.\nLife\nLife segment financial results for the

in 2016 and further upgraded the system in 2017. Both events resulted in impacts to other policy revenues, policyholder benefits, and change in deferred policy acquisition costs. Neither event had significant impacts on operating income.\nThe unlocking of best estimate assumptions on the interest sensitive block impacted other policy revenues, policyholder benefits, and change in deferred policy acquisition costs. The Company unlocked assumptions in 2017 and 2018 with favorable operating income impacts of $5 million and $6 million, respectively.\nEarnings\nEarnings increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher premiums and other policy revenues. Earnings increased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in policyholder benefits.\nPremiums and other revenues\nPremiums increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 and 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to continued growth in renewal premium on traditional life products.\nOther policy revenues, which include cost of insurance charges, earned policy service fees and surrender charges, have also increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 as the size of our interest sensitive block continues to grow, through increased sales and aging of the in-force. The decrease in other policy revenue during 2017 compared to 2016 is due to the change in estimates discussed in \"Items affecting the comparability of life results\" section.\nLife insurance sales\nThe following table presents life insurance sales as measured by annualized premium, a non-GAAP measure used by the insurance industry, which allows a comparison of new policies sold by an insurance company during the period (in thousands):\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change over prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Traditional Life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(952\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal Life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indexed UL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Recurring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single and excess(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit life(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(613\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(346\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) These are weighted amounts representing 10% of single and excess premiums and 31% of credit life premiums. In 2018, credit life weighting changed from 15% to 31% due to an increase in monthly outstanding balance; 2017 amounts have been updated for comparison purposes.\nLife insurance sales measure activity associated with gaining new insurance business in the current period, and includes deposits received related to interest sensitive life and universal life-type products. In contrast, GAAP premium revenues are associated with policies sold in current and prior periods, and deposits received related to interest sensitive life and universal life-type products are recorded in a policyholder account which is reflected as a liability. Therefore, a reconciliation of premium revenues and insurance sales is not meaningful.\nLife insurance sales increased during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increased Indexed Universal Life sales. Life insurance sales increased in all major product lines during 2017 compared to 2016.\nBenefits, losses and expenses\nPolicyholder benefits increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 attributable to an increase in the severity of claims. Policyholder benefits decreased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the change in estimates.\nCommissions increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 which was commensurate with the increase in indexed universal life and universal life sales. Commissions increased during 2017 compared to 2016 which was commensurate with the increase in life sales.\nThe following table presents the components of the change in DAC (in thousands):\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change over prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition cost capitalized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(97,263\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74,068\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(112,712\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,195\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in DAC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,887\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,893\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe amortization of DAC increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 due to release of reserves due to an increase in the severity of claims.

In our life segment, we currently retain 100% of newly developed permanent and term products up to our retention limit and cede the excess. We also engage in facultative reinsurance through several reinsurers. Accidental death and premium waiver benefits are mostly retained on new business.

Earnings increased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses as well as the conversion of SPIA reserve valuation discussed in \"Items affecting the comparability of annuity results\" section immediately above.\nPremiums and other revenues\nAnnuity premium and deposit amounts received are shown below (in thousands):\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change over prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed deferred annuity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>399,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>741,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>508,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(342,082\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single premium immediate annuity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>261,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>281,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,712\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity-indexed deferred annuity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>858,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>893,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>572,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34,749\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>320,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable deferred annuity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,563\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>458\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total premium and deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,593,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,972,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,438,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(378,690\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>533,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Policy deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,362,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,750,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,190,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(387,510\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>560,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total earned premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>222,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26,507\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales declined during the year ended December 31, 2018 driven by a decrease in fixed deferred products. Deferred products are deposit type contracts and do not contribute to earned premiums. Sales strengthened during 2017 compared to 2016 led by the equity-indexed and fixed deferred products. Earned premiums consist of single premium immediate annuity sales which increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. These variances are reflective of our management of our annuity block in a very competitive environment for annuities.\nWe monitor account values and changes in those values as a key indicator of performance in our Annuity segment.

Reserve increases are highly correlated to the sales volume of SPIA contracts, which explains the change in benefits over the past three years.\nCommissions decreased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 driven by a decrease in sales of fixed deferred and equity-indexed products partially offset by an increase in single premium immediate products. Commissions increased during 2017 compared to 2016 driven by an increase in sales of deferred annuity and equity-indexed products.\nOther operating expenses remained relatively flat during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. Other operating expenses decreased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a non-recurring premium tax payment in 2016.\nThe change in DAC represents acquisition costs capitalized less the amortization of existing DAC, which is calculated in proportion to expected gross profits.

Changes in this ratio reflect the impact of emerging experience. The ratios for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 35.0%, 36.8% and 35.5%, respectively. A higher ratio is less favorable due to a higher proportion of the margin used to amortize DAC.\nIn 2018, DAC assumptions were unlocked, resulting in a favorable reduction in amortization.\nInterest Margin\nOverall, the margin earned on annuity reserves decreased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, due to continued spread compression and unfavorable market conditions

business and increased losses impacting our homeowners and personal auto lines of business. Earnings increased during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased net premiums earned coupled with an improvement in the loss ratio.\nPremiums and other revenues\nNet premiums written and earned increased for all major lines of business during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The largest increases were in the personal auto, homeowners, and other commercial lines of business.\nBenefits, losses and expenses\nClaims increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 due to increases in non-catastrophe losses in the personal, commercial automobile and homeowners lines. Claims incurred increased during 2017 compared to 2016, as a result of increases in catastrophe losses and premium growth.\nCommissions increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily as a result of the premium growth as well as the mix of products.\nOperating expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, but at a rate less than the increase in premiums. Operating expenses increased during 2017 compared to 2016, as a result of costs related to growth initiatives.\nProducts\nOur Property and Casualty segment consists of: (i) Personal products, marketed primarily to individuals, representing 58.9% of net premiums written; (ii) Commercial products, focused primarily on agricultural and other business related markets, representing 31.3% of net premiums written; and (iii) Credit-related property insurance products, marketed to and through financial institutions and retailers, representing 9.8% of net premiums written.\nPersonal Products\nPersonal

The loss and combined ratios increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increased claim activity outpacing premium. The loss and combined ratios decreased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an improvement in rate adequacy somewhat offset by an increase in catastrophe losses.\nHomeowners: Net premiums written and earned increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increased sales to renters, as well as rate increases. The loss and combined ratios increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 due to an increase in weather-related catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses. Net premiums written and earned increased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to increased sales to renters. The loss and combined ratios increased during 2017 compared to 2016 due to an increase in catastrophe losses.\nOther Personal: These products include coverages for individuals seeking to protect their personal property and liability not covered within their home and auto policies such as coverages for watercraft, personal umbrella, and rental owners.

The decrease in the loss and combined ratios for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to the favorable workers' compensation experience. Net premiums written and earned increased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to increased sales of mortgage security insurance and workers' compensation. The decrease in the loss and combined ratios for 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily due to decreased claim activity on business owners' lines of business and lower than anticipated prior year claim emergence on workers' compensation.\nAgricultural Business: Our agricultural business product allows policyholders to customize and cover their agriculture exposure using a package policy, which includes coverage for residences and household contents, farm buildings and building contents, personal and commercial liability and personal property.

The loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2018 is comparable to the year ended December 31, 2017. The combined ratio for 2018 decreased compared to 2017 due to lower commission expense in the CPI business. Net written and earned premiums increased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in debt cancellation business. The loss and combined ratios increased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in claims in the Guaranteed Auto Protection (\"GAP\") business, partially resulting from catastrophes that caused flooding to automobiles.\nReinsurance\nWe reinsure a portion of the risks that we underwrite to manage our loss exposure. In return for ceded premiums, reinsurers assume a portion of the claims incurred. In addition to our reinsurance coverage, we are partially protected by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 and its predecessors. We participate in the National Flood Insurance Program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nWe retain the first $500,000 for workers' compensation risks and the first $1.5 million of loss per risk for non-workers' compensation risks. Workers' compensation reinsurance coverage for losses between $500,000 and $1 million follows satisfaction of a $2 million annual aggregate deductible.

The reinstatement premium is prorated by the percentage of actual loss to the coverage, with the exception of losses from $35 million to $100 million, which reflect a 50% reduction on the prorated amount, and the losses from $17.5 million to $35 million, in which a 39% portion is free for the first limit through reinstatement premium protection coverage purchased. The 12.4% placement of non-reinstateable coverage reduces the amount of reinstatement premium we are obligated to pay.\nWe purchase a Catastrophe Aggregate reinsurance coverage that provides for $30 million of limit excess of $90 million of aggregated catastrophe losses. Qualifying losses include amounts of retained losses below $10 million on Property Claims Services ( PCS\u201d) declared catastrophe events and internally declared catastrophe events exceeding $5 million. The Catastrophe Aggregate reinsurance coverage has been placed at 100.0% for 2019 and does not include a reinstatement.\nA Stretch & Aggregate cover is purchased which consists of a $35 million annual limit available either wholly or in part across two layers. The first layer is 8.75% of $400 million excess of $100 million on an occurrence basis. The second layer provides aggregate protection where subject loss is $35 million excess of $5 million of each catastrophe. Recoveries follow satisfaction of a $40 million annual aggregate deductible. This cover was placed at 90% on July 1, 2018, and remains in place until June 30, 2019. American National expects to place the cover again on July 1, 2019.\nWe use multiple reinsurers with each reinsurer absorbing part of the overall risk ceded.

The actual final cost of settling both claims outstanding at December 31, 2018 and claims expected to arise from unexpired periods of risk is uncertain. There are many other possible changes that would cause losses to increase or decrease, which include but are not limited to: claim severity; the expected level of reported claims; judicial action changing the scope or liability of coverage; the regulatory, social and economic environment; and unexpected changes in loss inflation.

As a result, equity securities are no longer classified as available-for-sale with unrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income; rather, all changes in the fair value of equity securities are now recognized in earnings. Since changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each reporting period, OTTI is no longer recognized on equity securities in a loss position. Prior periods have not been restated to conform to the current presentation. See note 3, Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.\nEarnings\nEarnings decreased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to net losses on equity securities due to unfavorable market conditions reflected in the S&P 500 index and a reduction in realized investment gains in 2018 compared to 2017. Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018 included net losses on equity securities as a result of our adoption of new accounting guidance which was effective January 1, 2018. Earnings increased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in realized investment gains. The increase in realized investment gains is primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of equity securities and certain real estate holdings. These increases were partially offset during 2017 by an increase in other operating expenses which included a pension cost of $12.5 million relating to the completion of the one-time pension payment window that occurred in 2017.\nInvestments\nWe manage our investment portfolio to optimize the rate of return commensurate with sound and prudent asset selection and to maintain a well-diversified portfolio. Our investment operations are regulated primarily by the state insurance departments where our insurance companies are domiciled. Investment activities, including setting investment policies and defining acceptable risk levels, are subject to oversight by our Board of Directors, which is assisted by our Finance Committee and Management Risk Committee.\nOur insurance and annuity products are generally supported by investment-grade bonds and commercial mortgage loans. We also invest in equity options as a hedge for our indexed products. We purchase fixed maturity securities and designate them as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale considering our estimated future cash flow needs. We also monitor the composition of our fixed maturity securities classified as held-to-maturity and available-for-sale and adjust the mix within the portfolio as investments mature or new investments are purchased.\nWe invest in commercial mortgage loans when the yield and credit risk compare favorably with fixed maturity securities. Individual residential mortgage loans including sub-prime or Alt-A mortgage loans have not been and are not expected to be part of our investment portfolio. We purchase real estate and equity investments based on a risk and reward analysis where we believe there are opportunities for enhanced returns.\nThe following summarizes the carrying values of our invested assets (other than investments in unconsolidated affiliates) by asset class (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturity, bonds held-to-maturity, at amortized cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,211,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,552,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturity, bonds available-for-sale, at fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,215,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,145,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities, at fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,530,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,784,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans on real estate, net of allowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,124,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,749,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>377,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment real estate, net of accumulated depreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>587,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>532,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>206,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>658,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other invested assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,302,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,880,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in our total investments at December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily a result of an increase in bonds held-to-maturity and mortgage loans, somewhat offset by a reduction in short-term investments and a decline in the fair value of equity securities.\nBonds-We allocate most of our fixed maturity securities to support our insurance business. At December 31, 2018, our fixed maturity securities had an estimated fair value of $14.3 billion, which was $0.1 billion, or 0.9%, below amortized cost. At December 31, 2017, our fixed maturity securities had an estimated fair value of $13.9 billion, which was $0.4 billion, or 3.0%, above amortized cost. The estimated fair value for securities due in one year or less was $0.5 billion as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. For additional information regarding total bonds by credit quality rating refer to Note 4, Investments in Securities, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEquity Securities-We invest in companies publicly traded on national U.S. stock exchanges. See Note 4, Investments in Securities, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value of the equity securities.\nMortgage Loans- We invest in commercial mortgage loans that are diversified by property-type and geography. Generally, mortgage loans are secured by first liens on income-producing real estate with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 75%. Mortgage loans are generally carried at outstanding principal balances, adjusted for any unamortized premium or discount, deferred fees or expenses, and net of allowances. The weighted average coupon yield on the principal funded for mortgage loans was 4.9% and 4.7% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For additional information regarding mortgage loans refer to Note 5, Mortgage Loans, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nPolicy Loans-For certain life insurance products, policyholders may borrow funds using the policy's cash value as collateral. The maximum amount of the policy loan depends upon the policy's surrender value. As of December 31, 2018, we had $376.3 million in policy loans with a loan to surrender value of approximately 60%, and at December 31, 2017, we had $377.1 million in policy loans with a loan to surrender value of approximately 63%. Interest rates on policy loans primarily range from 3.0% to 12.0% per annum. Policy loans may be repaid at any time by the policyholder and have priority to any claims on the policy. If the policyholder fails to repay the policy loan, funds are withdrawn from the policy's benefits.\nInvestment Real Estate-We invest in commercial real estate where positive cash flows and/or appreciation in value is expected. Real estate may be owned directly by our insurance companies or non-insurance affiliates or indirectly in joint ventures with real estate developers or investors we determine share our perspective regarding risk and return relationships. The carrying value of real estate is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairments, if any. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the properties.\nShort-Term Investments-Short-term investments are primarily commercial paper rated A2 or P2 or better by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively. The amount fluctuates depending on our view of the desirability of investing in the available long-term investment opportunities and our liquidity needs, including mortgage investment-funding commitments.\nNet Investment Income and Net Realized Gains (Losses)\nNet investment income decreased $107.7 million during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a loss on options due to a downturn in the S&P 500 Index.\nInterest income on mortgage loans is accrued on the principal amount of the loan at the contractual interest rate. Accretion of discounts is recorded using the effective yield method. Interest income, accretion of discounts and prepayment fees are reported in net investment income. Interest is not accrued on loans generally more than 90 days past due or when the collection of interest is not considered probable. Loans in foreclosure are placed on non-accrual status. Interest received on non-accrual status mortgage loans is included in net investment income in the period received.\nNet realized gains decreased $86.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease in net realized gains in 2018 was primarily attributable to new accounting guidance affecting how income from the sale of equity securities is recognized. Other-than-temporary impairment on investment securities decreased $12.1 million during 2018 compared to 2017.\nNet Unrealized Gains and Losses\nThe unrealized gains and losses of our fixed maturity and equity securities investment portfolio are shown below (in thousands):\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Held-to-Maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>240,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(168,310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(153,768\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,319\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(134,449\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains (losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(81,365\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>221,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(302,759\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available-for-Sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(143,517\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(107,344\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,396\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(89,948\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains (losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46,058\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(233,465\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(127,423\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>408,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(536,224\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net change in the unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities between December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to the increase in benchmark ten-year interest rates which were 2.7% and 2.4% respectively. The Company does not currently intend to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity requirements have been and are expected to continue to be met by funds from operations, comprised of premiums received from our customers, collateral for derivative transactions, and investment income and maturities. The primary use of cash has been and is expected to continue to be payment of policyholder benefits and claims incurred. Current and expected patterns of claim frequency and severity may change from period to period but continue to be within historical norms. Management considers our current liquidity position to be sufficient to meet anticipated demands over the next twelve months. Our contractual obligations are not expected to have a significant negative impact to cash flows from operations.\nIncreasing interest rates may lead to an increase in the volume of annuity contracts sold, which may be partially offset by increases in surrenders. Our defined benefit plans are frozen and currently adequately funded; however, low interest rates, increased longevity of participants, and rising Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ( PBGC\u201d) premiums may cause us to increase our funding of the plans. An increase in funding provided an opportunity to realize tax savings on contributions made before September 15, 2018. Consequently, a $60 million contribution was made before the aforementioned deadline. This contribution did not significantly impact cash flow and resulted in an overfunded status on our qualified pension plan. No unusually large capital expenditures are expected in the next 12-24 months. We have paid dividends to stockholders for over 110 consecutive years and expect to continue this trend. There are no other known trends or uncertainties regarding product pricing, changes in product lines or rising costs that are expected to have a significant impact to cash flows from operations.\nFunds received as premium payments and deposits, that are not used for liquidity requirements are generally invested in bonds and commercial mortgages. Funds are invested with the intent that income from the investments and proceeds from the maturities will meet our ongoing cash flow needs. We historically have not had to liquidate invested assets in order to cover cash flow needs. We believe our portfolio of highly liquid available-for-sale investment securities, including equity securities, is sufficient to meet future liquidity needs as necessary. Deposits of certain securities under the Company's membership with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas ( FHLB\u201d) provided approximately $113 million of borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2018 should we require additional liquidity resources.\nThe Company holds collateral to offset exposure from its derivative counterparties. Cash flows associated with collateral received from counterparties change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes. As the value of a derivative asset declines or increases, the collateral requirements would also decline or increase respectively.\nOur cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment position decreased from $1.0 billion at December 31, 2017 to $474.9 million at December 31, 2018.

RBC is calculated using formulas applied to certain financial balances and activities that consider, among other things, investment risks related to the type and quality of investments, insurance risks associated with products and liabilities, interest rate risks and general business risks. Insurance companies that do not maintain capital and surplus at a level of at least 200% of the authorized control level RBC are required to take certain actions. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, American National Insurance Company's statutory capital and surplus was $3,162,808,000 and $3,293,474,000, respectively. American National Insurance Company and each of its insurance subsidiaries had statutory capital and surplus at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, substantially above 200% of the authorized control level.\nThe achievement of long-term growth will require growth in American National Insurance Company's and our insurance subsidiaries' statutory capital and surplus.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally are indicated by words such as expects,\u201d intends,\u201d anticipates,\u201d plans,\u201d believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d will\u201d or words of similar meaning, and include, without limitation, statements regarding the outlook of our business and expected financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to changes and uncertainties which are, in many instances, beyond our control and have been made based upon our assumptions, expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect upon us. There can be no assurance that future developments will be in accordance with our expectations, or that the effect of future developments on us will be as anticipated. It is not a matter of corporate policy for us to make specific projections relating to future earnings, and we do not endorse any projections regarding future performance made by others. Additionally, we do not publicly update or revise forward-looking statements based on the outcome of various foreseeable or unforeseeable events. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve various risks and uncertainties. There are certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements, including without limitation risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. Management's discussion and analysis ( MD&A\u201d) of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOverview\nChartered in 1905, we are a diversified insurance and financial services company offering a broad spectrum of insurance products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our headquarters are in Galveston, Texas.\nOur business has been and will continue to be influenced by a number of industry-wide, segment or product-specific trends and conditions. In our discussion below, we first outline the broad macro-economic or industry trends (General Trends) that we expect to impact our overall business. Second, we discuss certain segment-specific trends we believe may impact individual segments or specific products within these segments.\nSegments\nThe insurance segments do not directly own assets. Rather, assets are allocated to support the liabilities and capital allocated to each segment. The mix of assets allocated to each of the insurance segments is intended to support the characteristics of the insurance liabilities within each segment including expected cash flows and pricing assumptions, and is intended to be sufficient to support each segment's business activities. We have utilized this methodology consistently over all periods presented.\nThe Corporate and Other segment acts as the owner of all of the invested assets of the Company. The investment income from the invested assets is allocated to the insurance segments in accordance with the assets allocated to each insurance segment. Earnings of the Corporate and Other segment are derived from income related to invested assets not allocated to the insurance segments and from our non-insurance businesses. All realized investment gains and losses, which includes other-than-temporary impairments ( OTTI\u201d), are recorded in this segment.\nGeneral Trends\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are materially affected by economic and financial market conditions. The U.S. and global economies, as well as the capital markets, continue to show mixed signals, and uncertainties continue to be significant factors in the markets in which we operate. Factors such as consumer spending, business investment, the volatility of the capital markets, the level of interest rates, unemployment, the level of participation in the workforce and the risk of inflation or deflation will affect the business and economic environment and, in turn, impact the demand for the type of financial and insurance products we offer. Adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe those risks are somewhat mitigated by our financial strength, active enterprise risk management and disciplined underwriting for our products. Our diverse product mix and distribution channels across insurance segments is a strength that we expect will help us adapt to the volatile economic environment and give us the ability to serve the changing needs of our customers. Additionally, through our long-term business approach, we believe we are financially strong, and we are committed to providing a steady and reliable source of financial protection for policyholders.\nInterest Rates: The low-interest rate environment is a challenge for life insurers as the spreads on deposit-type contracts remain narrow, especially as interest rates have approached minimum crediting rates. Low market interest rates reduce the spreads between the amounts we credit to fixed annuity and individual life policyholders and the amounts we earn on the investments that support these obligations. Our ALM Committee actively manages the profitability of our in-force blocks. In previous years, we reduced the guaranteed minimum crediting rates on new fixed annuity contracts, which has afforded us the flexibility to respond to the unusually low-interest rate environment. In previous years, we also reduced crediting rates on in-force contracts, where permitted to do so. These actions help mitigate the adverse impact of low interest rates on the profitability of these products, although sales volume may be negatively impacted as a result. We also maintain assets with various maturities to support product liabilities and ensure liquidity. A gradual increase in longer-term interest rates relative to short-term rates generally will have a favorable effect on the profitability of our products. Rapidly rising interest rates could result in reduced persistency of our spread-based products, if contract holders shift assets into higher yielding investments. We believe our ability to react quickly to the changing marketplace will help us manage this risk.\nThe interest rate environment affects estimated future profit projections, which could impact the amortization of our DAC assets and the estimates of policyholder liabilities. Significantly lower future estimated profits may cause us to accelerate the amortization of DAC or require us to establish additional policyholder liabilities, thereby reducing earnings. We periodically review assumptions with respect to future earnings to make sure that they remain appropriate considering the current interest rate environment.\nLow interest rates are also challenging for property and casualty insurers. Investment income is an important element in earning an acceptable return on capital. Lower interest rates resulting in lower investment income require us to achieve better underwriting results. We have adjusted policy prices to help mitigate the adverse impact of low interest rates on our property and casualty business.\nChanging Regulatory Environment: The insurance industry is primarily regulated at the state level, although some life and annuity products and services are also subject to U.S. federal regulation. We are regularly subjected to additional or changing regulation that requires us to update systems, change product structure, increase the amount of reporting or adopt changes to distribution. These changes may increase the capital requirements for us and the industry, increase operating costs, change our operating practices and change our ability to provide products with pricing attractive to the marketplace.\nImportance of Operating Efficiencies: The volatile economic environment and costs associated with greater regulation create a further need for operating efficiencies. We manage our cost base while maintaining our commitment to provide superior customer service to policyholders and agents. Investments in technology are coordinated through a disciplined project management process. We anticipate continually improving our use of technology to enhance our policyholders' and agents' experience and increase efficiency of our employees.\nIncreased Role of Advanced Technology: The use of mobile technology has changed the way consumers want to conduct their business, including real-time access to information. Many customers expect to complete transactions in a digital format instead of traditional methods that require a phone call or submission of paper forms. Social media and other customer-facing technologies also reshape the way companies communicate and collaborate with key stakeholders, and new tools exist to better collect and analyze information for potential business opportunities and better manage risks. For example, American National has mobile-enabled all of its Internet-based access and leverages social media channels to reach out to potential customers to promote awareness of the company, including the products and services offered. We expect that technology will continue to evolve, offering new and more effective ways to reach and service our customers and shareholders. We evaluate available and evolving technologies and incorporate those that we believe offer appropriate benefits to the company and its customers.\nIncreased Challenges of Talent Attraction and Retention: Attracting qualified individuals and retaining existing employees is a challenge for all employers. Businesses have become extremely competitive in the talent marketplace, and with such low unemployment today, it has become a candidate's job market. Combined with the increasing impact of social media it is easier than ever for companies to find individuals with needed job skills and lure them away from their current positions. As a result, the ability to distinguish American National as the employer of choice grows increasingly challenging.\nOur expanded use of technology, particularly our new recruiting-marketing platform combined with greater use of social media, is intended to enhance our employer brand and educate candidates on why they should work for us. Our ongoing efforts to develop a diverse and inclusive workforce not only strengthens the engagement of our current employee population but helps make us an attractive employer where differing insights and opinions are valued. Valuing different perspectives and the impact of broader employee influence on how decisions are made, are two areas for the company to focus on for successful retention. Providing for robust career development opportunities and effective succession planning is expected to be another important part of our retention efforts.\nLife and Annuity\nLife insurance and annuity are mainstay segments, as they have been during our long history. We believe that the combination of predictable and decreasing mortality rates, positive cash flow generation for many years after policy issue and favorable persistency characteristics suggest a viable and profitable future for these lines of business.\nEffective management of invested assets and associated liabilities using crediting rates and, where applicable, financial hedging instruments (which we use as economic hedges of equity-indexed life and annuity products), is important to the success of our life and annuity segments. Asset disintermediation\u201d, the risk of large outflows of cash at times when it is disadvantageous to us to dispose of invested assets, is a risk associated with these segments.\nDemographics: We believe a key driver shaping the actions of the life insurance industry is the rising income protection, wealth accumulation and insurance needs of retiring Baby Boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964). As a result of increasing longevity and uncertainty regarding the Social Security System and an ongoing transition from defined benefit pension plans to 401(k) type retirement plans, retirees will need to accumulate sufficient savings to support retirement income requirements.\nWe believe we are well positioned to address the Baby Boomers' increasing need for savings tools and income protection. We believe that our overall financial strength and broad distribution channels position us to respond with a variety of products for individuals approaching retirement age, who seek information to plan for and manage their retirement needs. We believe our products that offer guaranteed income flows for life, including single premium immediate annuities, are well positioned to serve this market.\nCompetitive Pressures: In recent years, the competitive landscape of the U.S. life insurance industry has shifted. Established insurers are competing against each other and also against new market entrants that are developing products to attract the interest of the growing number of retirees. Competition exists in terms of retaining and acquiring consumers' business and also in terms of access to producers and distributors. Consolidation among distributors coupled with the aging sales force remains a challenge among insurers. In addition, the increased technological sophistication of consumers necessitates that insurers and distributors invest significant resources in technology to adapt to consumer expectations. We believe we possess sufficient scale, financial strength, resources and flexibility to compete effectively.\nThe annuity market is also highly competitive. In addition to aggressive interest crediting rates and new product features on annuities, there is competition from other financial service firms. Insurers continue to evaluate their distribution channels and the way they deliver products to consumers.\nWe believe we will continue to be competitive in the life and annuity markets through our broad line of products, diverse distribution channels, and consistent high level of customer service. We modify our products to meet customer needs and to expand our reach where we believe we can obtain profitable growth.\nHealth\nMost of the major provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and a reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Healthcare Acts\u201d), phased in effective January 1, 2014. The Healthcare Acts mandated broad changes in the delivery of health care benefits that have impacted our business model including our relationships with current and future customers, producers, and health care providers, as well as our products, services and processes. As a result, the Healthcare Acts generated new opportunities in the limited benefit and supplemental product markets. In recent years, we built a portfolio of such products to be sold in the worksite market as well as to individuals. We feel that recent changes to the Healthcare Acts that removed the tax consequences for not having health coverage and the removal of limitations on Short Term Medical products could significantly increase our production. We also continue to expand our presence in the worksite market to generate new opportunities in the broker market, as well as developing and implementing a captive sales force.\nWe expect our Managing General Underwriter ( MGU\u201d) business to remain stable during 2019. We generally retain only 10% of the MGU premium and risk. The majority of the revenue generated from this business is fee income included in Other income\u201d of the Health segment's operating results.\nProperty and Casualty\nWe offer our personal and commercial property and casualty lines of business primarily through exclusive agents. We favor a balanced, focused and collaborative approach to both growth and profitability through the development of successful agencies.\nTo acquire and retain profitable business, we use sophisticated pricing models and risk segmentation, along with a focused distribution force. We believe this approach allows us to make product enhancements and offer programs that are tailored to our target markets while charging an appropriate premium for the risk.\nDemand for property and casualty credit-related insurance products continues to increase. We continue to update credit-related insurance product offerings and pricing to meet changing market needs, as well as adding new agents to expand market share in the credit-related insurance market. We are reviewing and implementing procedures to enhance customer service while, at the same time, looking for efficiencies to reduce administrative costs.\nCompetition: The property and casualty insurance industry remains highly competitive. Despite the competitive environment, we expect to identify profitable opportunities through our strong distribution channels, expanding geographic coverage, marketing efforts, new product development and pricing sophistication.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that often involve a significant degree of judgment. These estimates and judgments include expectations of current and future mortality, morbidity, persistency, claims and claim adjustment expenses, recoverability of receivables, investment returns and interest rates which extend well into the future. In developing these estimates, there is inherent uncertainty, and material changes to facts and circumstances may develop. Although variability is inherent in these estimates, we believe the amounts as reported are appropriate, based upon the facts available upon compilation of the consolidated financial statements.\nOn an ongoing basis, management reviews the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the financial statements. If current facts and circumstances warrant modifications in estimates and assumptions, our financial position and results of operations as reported in the consolidated financial statements could change significantly.\nA description of these critical accounting estimates is presented below. Also, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nReserves\nLife and Annuity Reserves\nLife Reserving-Principal assumptions used in the determination of the reserves for future policy benefits are mortality, policy lapse rates, investment return, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type. Reserves for incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) claims on life policies are calculated using historical claims information. Reserves for interest-sensitive and variable universal life insurance policies are equal to the current account value calculated for the policyholder. Some of our universal life policies contain secondary guarantees, for which additional reserves are recorded based on the term of the policy.\nAnnuity Reserving-Reserves for payout annuities with more than insignificant amounts of mortality risk are calculated in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for limited pay insurance contracts. Benefit and maintenance expense reserves are calculated by using assumptions reflecting our expectations of future costs, including an appropriate margin for adverse deviation. These assumptions are locked-in at issue and generally reflect pricing assumptions from that period. If the resulting reserve would otherwise cause profits to be recognized at the issue date, additional reserves are recorded. The resulting recognition of profits would be gradual over the expected life of the contract.\nReserves for fixed deferred annuities are established equivalent to the account value held on behalf of the policyholder. Reserves for indexed annuities are calculated in accordance with derivative accounting guidance which defines a host liability for return of principal and guaranteed interest, and an embedded derivative liability for funded benefits in excess of the host guarantee. Additional reserves for benefits that can exceed contract fund value, such as lifetime income riders, are determined as needed in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The profit recognition on deferred annuity contracts is gradual over the expected life of the contract. No immediate profit is recognized on the sale of the contract.\nKey Assumptions-The following assumptions reflect our best estimates and may impact our life and annuity reserves:\n \u2022 Future lapse rates will remain reasonably consistent with our current expectations; \n \u2022 Mortality rates will remain reasonably consistent within standard industry mortality table ranges; and \n \u2022 Future interest spreads will remain reasonably consistent with our current expectations. \nRecoverability-At least annually, we test the adequacy of the net benefit reserves (policy benefit reserves less DAC) recorded for life insurance and annuity products. To perform the tests, we use our current best-estimate assumptions as to policyholder mortality, persistency, maintenance expenses and invested asset returns.\nFor interest-sensitive business, best-estimate assumptions are updated to reflect observed changes based on experience studies and current economic conditions. We reflect the effect of such assumption changes in DAC and reserve balances accordingly. Due to the long-term nature of many of the liabilities, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in profitability. In particular, changes in estimates of the future invested asset return have a large effect on the degree of reserve adequacy and DAC recoverability.\nFor traditional business, a lock-in\u201d principle applies, whereby the assumptions used to calculate the benefit reserves and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience. These include margins for adverse deviation in the event that actual experience differs from the original assumptions.\nHealth Reserves\nHealth reserves are established using the following methods:\nCompletion Factor Approach-This method assumes that the historical claim patterns will be an accurate representation of unpaid claim liabilities. An estimate of the unpaid claims is calculated by subtracting period-to-date paid claims from an estimate of the ultimate complete\u201d payment for all incurred claims in the period. Completion factors are calculated which complete\u201d the current period-to-date payment totals for each incurred month to estimate the ultimate expected payout.\nTabular Claims Reserves-This method is used to calculate the reserves for disability income blocks of business. These reserves rely on published valuation continuance tables created using industry experience regarding assumptions of continued morbidity and subsequent recovery. Reserves are calculated by applying these continuance tables, along with appropriate company experience adjustments, to the stream of contractual benefit payments. These expected benefit payments are discounted at the required interest rate.\nFuture Policy Benefits-Reserves are equal to the aggregate of the present value of expected future benefit payments, less the present value of expected future premiums. Morbidity and termination assumptions are based on our experience or published valuation tables when available and appropriate.\nPremium Deficiency Reserves-Deficiency reserves are established when the expected future claim payments and expenses for a classification of policies are in excess of the expected premiums for these policies. The determination of a deficiency reserve takes into consideration the likelihood of premium rate increases, the timing of these increases, and the expected benefit utilization patterns. We have established premium deficiency reserves for portions of the major medical business and the long-term care business that are in run-off. The assumptions and methods used to determine the deficiency reserves are reviewed periodically for reasonableness, and the reserve amount is monitored against emerging losses.\nProperty and Casualty Reserves\nReserves for Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense ( CAE\u201d)-Property and casualty reserves are established to provide for the estimated cost of settling and paying both reported ( case\u201d) as well as incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) claims. The two major categories of CAE are defense and cost containment expense, and adjusting and other expense. The details of property and casualty reserves are shown below (in thousands):\n\nCase Reserves-Reserves for reported losses are determined on either a judgment or a formula basis, depending on the timing and type of the loss. The formula reserve is a fixed amount for each claim of a given type based on historical paid loss data for similar claims with a provision for claim inflation. Judgment reserve amounts replace initial formula reserves and are set for each loss based on facts and circumstances of each case and the expectation of damages. We regularly monitor the adequacy of reserves on a case-by-case basis and change the amount of such reserves as necessary.\nIBNR-IBNR reserves are estimated based on many variables including: historical statistical information, inflation, legal environment, economic conditions, trends in claim severity and frequency as well as other factors affecting the adequacy of claim reserves. Loss and premium data is aggregated by exposure class and by accident year. IBNR reserves are estimated by projecting ultimate losses on each class of business and subtracting paid losses and case reserves. Our overall reserve practice provides for ongoing claims evaluation and adjustment based on the development of related data and other relevant information pertaining to claims. Adjustments in aggregate reserves, if any, are included in the results of operations of the period during which such adjustments are made.\nWe believe we conservatively reflect the potential uncertainty generated by volatility in our loss development profiles when selecting loss development factor patterns for each line of business. See Note 12, Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe evaluation process to determine reserves involves the collaboration of underwriting, claims and actuarial departments. The process also includes consultation with independent actuarial firms as part of our process of gaining reassurance that claims and CAE reserves estimate sufficiently, all obligations arising from all losses incurred as of year-end. The independent actuarial firm completes the Statements of Actuarial Opinion required by individual state insurance regulations at each year-end, opining that the recorded statutory claims and CAE reserves are reasonable.\nPremium Deficiency Reserve-Deficiency reserves are recorded when the expected claims payments and policy maintenance costs for a product line exceed the expected premiums for that product line. The estimation of a deficiency reserve considers the current profitability of a product line using anticipated claims, CAE, and policy maintenance costs. The assumptions and methods used to determine the need for deficiency reserves are reviewed periodically for reasonableness. There were no reserves of this type at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nProperty and Casualty Reserving Methodology-The following methods are utilized:\n \u2022 Initial Expected Loss Ratio-This method calculates an estimate of ultimate losses by applying an estimated loss ratio to actual earned premium for each calendar/accident year. This method is appropriate for classes of business where the actual paid or reported loss experience is not yet mature enough to influence initial expectations of the ultimate loss ratios. \n \u2022 Bornhuetter-Ferguson-This method uses as a starting point an assumed initial expected loss ratio method and blends in the loss ratio implied by the claims experience to date by using loss development patterns based on our historical experience. This method is generally appropriate where there are few reported claims and an unstable pattern of reported losses. \n \u2022 Loss or Expense Development (Chain Ladder)-This method uses actual loss or defense and cost containment expense data and the historical development profiles on older accident periods to project more recent, less developed periods to their ultimate total. This method is appropriate when there is a relatively stable pattern of loss and expense emergence and a relatively large number of reported claims. \n \u2022 Ratio of Paid Defense and Cost Containment Expense to Paid Loss Development-This method uses the ratio of paid defense and cost containment expense to paid loss data and the historical development profiles on older accident periods to project more recent, less developed periods to their ultimate total. In this method, an ultimate ratio of paid defense and cost containment expense to paid loss is selected for each accident period. The selected paid defense and cost containment expense to paid loss ratio is then applied to the selected ultimate loss for each accident period to estimate the ultimate defense and cost containment expense. Paid defense and cost containment expense is then subtracted from the ultimate defense and cost containment expense to calculate the unpaid defense and cost containment expense for that accident period. \n \u2022 Calendar Year Paid Adjusting and Other Expense to Paid Loss-This method uses a selected prior calendar years' paid expense to paid loss ratio to project ultimate loss adjustment expenses for adjusting and other expense. A percentage of the selected ratio is applied to the case reserves (depending on the line of insurance) and 100% to the indicated IBNR reserves. These ratios assume that a percentage of the expense is incurred when a claim is opened and the remaining percentage is paid throughout the claim's life. \nThe basis of our selected single point best estimate on a particular line of business is often a blended result from two or more methods (e.g. weighted averages). Our estimate is highly dependent on actuarial and management judgment as to which method(s) is most appropriate for a particular accident year and class of business. Our methodology changes over time, as new information emerges regarding underlying loss activity and other factors.\nKey Assumptions-The following assumptions may impact our property and casualty reserves:\n \u2022 Stability of future inflation rates and consistency with historical inflation norms; \n \u2022 The expected loss development patterns; \n \u2022 Consistent claims handling, reserving and payment processes; \n \u2022 No unusual growth patterns or unexpected changes in the mix of business; and \n \u2022 No significant prospective changes in laws that would significantly affect future payouts.  The loss ratio selections and development profiles are developed primarily using our historical claims and loss experience. These development patterns reflect prior inflation rates, and could be impacted by future changes in inflation rates, particularly those relating to medical care costs, automobile repair parts and building or home material costs. These assumptions have not been modified from the preceding periods and are consistent with historical loss reserve development patterns.\nFor non-credit lines of business, future inflation rates could vary from our assumption of relatively stable rates. Unexpected changes in future inflation rates could impact our financial position and liquidity, and we measure the sensitivity of our reserve levels to unexpected changes in inflation. The impacts of future inflation for a 1.0% decrease and 3.0% increase over the implied inflation rate in the December 31, 2018 gross loss reserve balance are as follows (amounts in thousands):\n\nThe analysis of our credit insurance lines of business quantifies the estimated impact on gross loss reserves of a reasonably likely scenario of varying the ratio applied to the earned premium to determine the IBNR reserves at December 31, 2018. IBNR reserving methodology for this line of business focuses primarily on the use of a ratio applied to the unearned premium for each credit insurance product. The selected ratios are based on historical loss and claim data. In our analysis, we varied this ratio by +/- 5% across all credit insurance products combined. The results of our analysis show an increase or decrease in gross reserves across all accident years combined of approximately $10.1 million.\nIt is not appropriate to aggregate the impacts shown in our sensitivity analysis, as our lines of business are not directly correlated. The variations are not meant to be a best-case\u201d or worst-case\u201d scenario, and it is possible that future variations will be more or less than the amounts in the sensitivity analysis. While these are possible scenarios based on the information available to us at this time, we do not believe the reader should consider our sensitivity analysis an actual reserve range.\nManagement believes our reserves at December 31, 2018 are adequate. New information, regulation, events or circumstances unknown at the original valuation date, however, may result in future development resulting in ultimate losses being significantly greater or less than the recorded reserves at December 31, 2018.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nWe had a DAC asset of approximately $1.50 billion and $1.37 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 10, Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nWe believe the estimates used in our DAC calculations provide an example of how variations in assumptions and estimates would affect our business. The following table displays the sensitivity of reasonably likely changes in assumptions in the DAC amortization for our long-tail business at December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\n\nReinsurance\nWe manage our insurance underwriting risk exposures by purchasing reinsurance. We manage counterparty risk by entering into agreements with reinsurers we consider creditworthy, generally measured by the individual entity or entities' financial strength rating. However, we do not require a specified minimum rating. We monitor the concentrations of the reinsurers and reduce the participation percentage of lower-rated and unrated companies when appropriate in our judgment. While we believe we currently have no significant credit risk related to reinsurance counterparties, we continue to monitor their financial condition.\nSome of our reinsurance contracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate the participation with reinsurers whose ratings are downgraded. Information used in our risk assessment is comprised of industry ratings, recent news and reports, and a limited review of financial statements. We also may require reinsurers not licensed in our state of domicile or with whom we have limited experience, to provide letters of credit, trust agreements, or cash advances to fund their share of reserves.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment\nA decline in the fair value of fixed maturity investment securities below their cost basis is evaluated on an ongoing basis to determine if the decline is other-than-temporary. A number of assumptions and estimates inherent in evaluating impairments are used to determine if they are other-than-temporary, which include 1) our ability and intent to hold the investment securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; 2) the expected recoverability of principal and interest; 3) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost basis; 4) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; and 5) the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position, including market conditions, which could affect liquidity.\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities is determined by management using one of the three primary sources of information: the quoted prices in active markets; third-party pricing services; or independent broker quotations. Estimated fair value of securities based on quoted prices in active markets is readily and regularly available; therefore, valuation of these securities generally does not involve management judgment. For securities without quoted prices, fair value measurement is determined using third-party pricing services' proprietary pricing applications. Typical inputs used by the models are relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmark pricing of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. Any securities remaining unpriced after utilizing the first two pricing methods are submitted to independent brokers for prices. We have analyzed the third-party pricing services and independent brokers' valuation methodologies and related inputs, and have evaluated the various types of securities in our investment portfolio to determine an appropriate fair value hierarchy level based upon trading activity and the observability of market inputs. Management completes certain tests throughout the year and at year-end to determine that prices provided by our pricing services are reasonable.\nWe utilize over-the-counter equity options to hedge our exposure to equity-indexed universal life and equity-indexed deferred annuity benefits, and the fair values for these options are sourced from broker quotations. Accounting guidance requires a fair value calculation as part of equity-indexed policy reserves. This is called the value of embedded derivative (or VED) and the other part of the indexed policy reserve is called the host reserve. The embedded derivative represents future benefit cash flows in excess of minimum guarantee cash flows. The host covers the minimum guarantee cash flows. Both the VED and the host reserve are calculated by a vendor-sourced reserve valuation system. The VED calculation model incorporates assumptions related to current option pricing (such as implied volatility and LIBOR/swap curve), future policyholder behavior (such as surrenders and withdrawals), and factors affecting the value of future indexed interest periods (such as option budgets).\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe Company has frozen each of its defined benefit pension plans. Our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related costs covering our employees are estimated using actuarial concepts in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. The discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense and/or liability measurements. Each year, these key assumptions are reevaluated to determine whether they reflect the best estimates for the current period. Changes in the methodology used to determine the best estimates are made when facts or circumstances change. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined using the building-block method which is described further in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices, Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans. In 2017, the Company commenced a one-time window offering to terminated, vested participants of our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The offer allowed participants to take a lump sum or annuity payout which was funded from pension plan assets. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18, Pension and Postretirement Benefits for additional details.\nLitigation Contingencies\nBased on information currently available, we believe that amounts ultimately paid, if any, arising from existing and currently potential litigation would not have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. However, it should be noted that the frequency of large damage awards, which bear little or no relation to the economic damages incurred by plaintiffs, continues to create the potential for an unpredictable judgment in any given lawsuit. It is possible that, if the defenses in these lawsuits are not successful, and the judgments are greater than we anticipate, the resulting liability could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nFederal Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is based on income at statutory tax rates, adjusted for non-taxable and non-deductible items, and tax credits. Management's best estimate of future events and their impact is included in our effective tax rate. Certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, and completion of tax audits could have an impact on our estimates and effective tax rate. Audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed.\nGAAP requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, and if so, the amount of such valuation allowance. There were no material valuation allowances recorded during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that our remaining deferred tax assets will be realized and that no additional valuation allowance is necessary as of December 31, 2018.\nOn December 22, 2017, the federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Reform\u201d). Tax Reform made broad and complex changes to federal corporate tax law and resulted in changes to our overall tax obligations. Most notably, Tax Reform reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Other provisions affecting corporations include, but are not limited to, changes to the deductibility of interest expense, limitations on certain deductions for executive compensation and the repeal of the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. In addition, there were several changes that are specific to insurance companies, namely changes to the proration formula used to determine the amount of dividends eligible for the dividends-received deduction, and changes to the calculation of tax reserves associated with policyholder liabilities.\nSubsequent to enactment, the Securities Exchange Commission introduced Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d). SAB 118 provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the Tax Reform where our determinations were incomplete but we were able to determine a reasonable estimate. A final determination is required to be made within a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment of Tax Reform. In 2017, we recorded a provisional tax benefit of $206.4 million in accordance with the guidance in SAB 118. As a result of Tax Reform, we remeasured our existing deferred tax balances to the new 21% corporate income tax rate. Additionally, we made a reasonable estimate to evaluate the impact of Tax Reform on our 2017 financial statements. There were no adjustments in 2018 to the provisional tax benefit we recorded in 2017.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following sets forth the consolidated results of operations (in thousands):\n\n (1) A negative amount of net change indicates more expense was deferred than amortized and represents a decrease to expenses in the period indicated.  A positive amount of net change indicates less expense was deferred than amortized and represents an increase to expenses in the period indicated.\nIncome before federal income taxes and other items ( Earnings\u201d)\nEarnings decreased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of net unrealized losses on equity securities in income as required by new accounting guidance. The earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018 were also impacted by a reduced interest margin resulting from a decrease in the S&P 500 index on equity-indexed products in our Annuity segment as well as losses impacting our homeowners, commercial auto and GAP lines of business in our Property and Casualty segment. Earnings increased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in net investment income and realized investment gains. The increase in net investment income was attributable to increased income on mortgage loans. The increase in realized investment gains was attributable to an increase in the sale of bonds, equity securities, and certain real estate holdings.\nLife\nLife segment financial results for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands):\n\n (1) A negative amount of net change indicates more expense was deferred than amortized and represents a decrease to expenses in the period indicated.  A positive amount of net change indicates less expense was deferred than amortized and represents an increase to expenses in the period indicated.\nItems affecting the comparability of life results\nThe Company converted the valuation of its universal life business from an internally developed valuation system to a vendor based system in 2016 and further upgraded the system in 2017. Both events resulted in impacts to other policy revenues, policyholder benefits, and change in deferred policy acquisition costs. Neither event had significant impacts on operating income.\nThe unlocking of best estimate assumptions on the interest sensitive block impacted other policy revenues, policyholder benefits, and change in deferred policy acquisition costs. The Company unlocked assumptions in 2017 and 2018 with favorable operating income impacts of $5 million and $6 million, respectively.\nEarnings\nEarnings increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher premiums and other policy revenues. Earnings increased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in policyholder benefits.\nPremiums and other revenues\nPremiums increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 and 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to continued growth in renewal premium on traditional life products.\nOther policy revenues, which include cost of insurance charges, earned policy service fees and surrender charges, have also increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 as the size of our interest sensitive block continues to grow, through increased sales and aging of the in-force. The decrease in other policy revenue during 2017 compared to 2016 is due to the change in estimates discussed in \"Items affecting the comparability of life results\" section.\nLife insurance sales\nThe following table presents life insurance sales as measured by annualized premium, a non-GAAP measure used by the insurance industry, which allows a comparison of new policies sold by an insurance company during the period (in thousands):\n\n(1) These are weighted amounts representing 10% of single and excess premiums and 31% of credit life premiums. In 2018, credit life weighting changed from 15% to 31% due to an increase in monthly outstanding balance; 2017 amounts have been updated for comparison purposes.\nLife insurance sales measure activity associated with gaining new insurance business in the current period, and includes deposits received related to interest sensitive life and universal life-type products. In contrast, GAAP premium revenues are associated with policies sold in current and prior periods, and deposits received related to interest sensitive life and universal life-type products are recorded in a policyholder account which is reflected as a liability. Therefore, a reconciliation of premium revenues and insurance sales is not meaningful.\nLife insurance sales increased during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increased Indexed Universal Life sales. Life insurance sales increased in all major product lines during 2017 compared to 2016.\nBenefits, losses and expenses\nPolicyholder benefits increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 attributable to an increase in the severity of claims. Policyholder benefits decreased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the change in estimates.\nCommissions increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 which was commensurate with the increase in indexed universal life and universal life sales. Commissions increased during 2017 compared to 2016 which was commensurate with the increase in life sales.\nThe following table presents the components of the change in DAC (in thousands):\n\nThe amortization of DAC increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 due to release of reserves due to an increase in the severity of claims. The increase in DAC during 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the change in estimates.\nPolicy in-force information\nThe following table summarizes changes in the Life segment's in-force amounts (in thousands):\n\nThe following table summarizes changes in the Life segment's number of policies in-force:\n\nTotal life insurance in-force increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 and 2017 compared to 2016, due to increased sales, despite a reduction in the number of policies in-force. The reduction in policies in-force reflects continued decrease in lower face amount policies.\nReinsurance\nThe table below summarizes reinsurance reserves and premium amounts assumed and ceded (in thousands):\n\nWe use reinsurance to mitigate certain risks to the life segment. During 2018, our retention limits were $1.5 million for issue ages 65 and under, and $700,000 for issue ages 66 and older for traditional and universal life. In our life segment, we currently retain 100% of newly developed permanent and term products up to our retention limit and cede the excess. We also engage in facultative reinsurance through several reinsurers. Accidental death and premium waiver benefits are mostly retained on new business. Increases in reserves and premium amounts ceded primarily reflect increased use of reinsurance in conjunction with treaties related to universal life products.\nFor 2018, the companies to whom we have ceded reinsurance for the Life segment are shown below (in thousands, except percentages) \n (1) A.M. Best rating as of the most current information available February 15, 2019.  In addition, reinsurance is used in the credit life business primarily to provide producers of credit-related insurance products the opportunity to participate in the underwriting risk through producer-owned captive reinsurance companies often domiciled outside of the United States. A majority of the treaties entered into by our Specialty Markets Group are written on a 100% coinsurance basis with benefit limits of $100,000 on credit life.\nAnnuity\nAnnuity segment financial results for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands):\n\n (1) A negative amount of net change indicates more expense was deferred than amortized and represents a decrease to expenses in the period indicated.  A positive amount of net change indicates less expense was deferred than amortized and represents an increase to expenses in the period indicated.\nItems affecting the comparability of annuity results\nThe Company converted the valuation of its single premium immediate annuity business from a mainframe valuation system to a more robust vendor based system in 2017 resulting in a $9.6 million decrease in estimates affecting policyholder benefits.\nEarnings\nEarnings decreased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a reduced interest margin on equity-indexed products, driven by mark-to-market option volatility resulting from a decrease in the S&P 500 index. Earnings increased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses as well as the conversion of SPIA reserve valuation discussed in \"Items affecting the comparability of annuity results\" section immediately above.\nPremiums and other revenues\nAnnuity premium and deposit amounts received are shown below (in thousands):\n ", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally are indicated by words such as expects,\u201d intends,\u201d anticipates,\u201d plans,\u201d believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d will\u201d or words of similar meaning, and include, without limitation, statements regarding the outlook of our business and expected financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to changes and uncertainties which are, in many instances, beyond our control and have been made based upon our assumptions, expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect upon us. There can be no assurance that future developments will be in accordance with our expectations, or that the effect of future developments on us will be as anticipated. It is not a matter of corporate policy for us to make specific projections relating to future earnings, and we do not endorse any projections regarding future performance made by others. Additionally, we do not publicly update or revise forward-looking statements based on the outcome of various foreseeable or unforeseeable events. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve various risks and uncertainties. There are certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements, including without limitation risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. Management's discussion and analysis ( MD&A\u201d) of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOverview\nChartered in 1905, we are a diversified insurance and financial services company offering a broad spectrum of insurance products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our headquarters are in Galveston, Texas.\nOur business has been and will continue to be influenced by a number of industry-wide, segment or product-specific trends and conditions. In our discussion below, we first outline the broad macro-economic or industry trends (General Trends) that we expect to impact our overall business. Second, we discuss certain segment-specific trends we believe may impact individual segments or specific products within these segments.\nSegments\nThe insurance segments do not directly own assets. Rather, assets are allocated to support the liabilities and capital allocated to each segment. The mix of assets allocated to each of the insurance segments is intended to support the characteristics of the insurance liabilities within each segment including expected cash flows and pricing assumptions, and is intended to be sufficient to support each segment's business activities. We have utilized this methodology consistently over all periods presented.\nThe Corporate and Other segment acts as the owner of all of the invested assets of the Company. The investment income from the invested assets is allocated to the insurance segments in accordance with the assets allocated to each insurance segment. Earnings of the Corporate and Other segment are derived from income related to invested assets not allocated to the insurance segments and from our non-insurance businesses. All realized investment gains and losses, which includes other-than-temporary impairments ( OTTI\u201d), are recorded in this segment.\nGeneral Trends\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are materially affected by economic and financial market conditions. The U.S. and global economies, as well as the capital markets, continue to show mixed signals, and uncertainties continue to be significant factors in the markets in which we operate. Factors such as consumer spending, business investment, the volatility of the capital markets, the level of interest rates, unemployment, the level of participation in the workforce and the risk of inflation or deflation will affect the business and economic environment and, in turn, impact the demand for the type of financial and insurance products we offer. Adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe those risks are somewhat mitigated by our financial strength, active enterprise risk management and disciplined underwriting for our products. Our diverse product mix and distribution channels across insurance segments is a strength that we expect will help us adapt to the volatile economic environment and give us the ability to serve the changing needs of our customers. Additionally, through our long-term business approach, we believe we are financially strong, and we are committed to providing a steady and reliable source of financial protection for policyholders.\nInterest Rates: The low-interest rate environment is a challenge for life insurers as the spreads on deposit-type contracts remain narrow, especially as interest rates have approached minimum crediting rates. Low market interest rates reduce the spreads between the amounts we credit to fixed annuity and individual life policyholders and the amounts we earn on the investments that support these obligations. Our ALM Committee actively manages the profitability of our in-force blocks. In previous years, we reduced the guaranteed minimum crediting rates on new fixed annuity contracts, which has afforded us the flexibility to respond to the unusually low-interest rate environment. In previous years, we also reduced crediting rates on in-force contracts, where permitted to do so. These actions help mitigate the adverse impact of low interest rates on the profitability of these products, although sales volume may be negatively impacted as a result. We also maintain assets with various maturities to support product liabilities and ensure liquidity. A gradual increase in longer-term interest rates relative to short-term rates generally will have a favorable effect on the profitability of our products. Rapidly rising interest rates could result in reduced persistency of our spread-based products, if contract holders shift assets into higher yielding investments. We believe our ability to react quickly to the changing marketplace will help us manage this risk.\nThe interest rate environment affects estimated future profit projections, which could impact the amortization of our DAC assets and the estimates of policyholder liabilities. Significantly lower future estimated profits may cause us to accelerate the amortization of DAC or require us to establish additional policyholder liabilities, thereby reducing earnings. We periodically review assumptions with respect to future earnings to make sure that they remain appropriate considering the current interest rate environment.\nLow interest rates are also challenging for property and casualty insurers. Investment income is an important element in earning an acceptable return on capital. Lower interest rates resulting in lower investment income require us to achieve better underwriting results. We have adjusted policy prices to help mitigate the adverse impact of low interest rates on our property and casualty business.\nChanging Regulatory Environment: The insurance industry is primarily regulated at the state level, although some life and annuity products and services are also subject to U.S. federal regulation. We are regularly subjected to additional or changing regulation that requires us to update systems, change product structure, increase the amount of reporting or adopt changes to distribution. These changes may increase the capital requirements for us and the industry, increase operating costs, change our operating practices and change our ability to provide products with pricing attractive to the marketplace.\nImportance of Operating Efficiencies: The volatile economic environment and costs associated with greater regulation create a further need for operating efficiencies. We manage our cost base while maintaining our commitment to provide superior customer service to policyholders and agents. Investments in technology are coordinated through a disciplined project management process. We anticipate continually improving our use of technology to enhance our policyholders' and agents' experience and increase efficiency of our employees.\nIncreased Role of Advanced Technology: The use of mobile technology has changed the way consumers want to conduct their business, including real-time access to information. Many customers expect to complete transactions in a digital format instead of traditional methods that require a phone call or submission of paper forms. Social media and other customer-facing technologies also reshape the way companies communicate and collaborate with key stakeholders, and new tools exist to better collect and analyze information for potential business opportunities and better manage risks. For example, American National has mobile-enabled all of its Internet-based access and leverages social media channels to reach out to potential customers to promote awareness of the company, including the products and services offered. We expect that technology will continue to evolve, offering new and more effective ways to reach and service our customers and shareholders. We evaluate available and evolving technologies and incorporate those that we believe offer appropriate benefits to the company and its customers.\nIncreased Challenges of Talent Attraction and Retention: Attracting qualified individuals and retaining existing employees is a challenge for all employers. Businesses have become extremely competitive in the talent marketplace, and with such low unemployment today, it has become a candidate's job market. Combined with the increasing impact of social media it is easier than ever for companies to find individuals with needed job skills and lure them away from their current positions. As a result, the ability to distinguish American National as the employer of choice grows increasingly challenging.\nOur expanded use of technology, particularly our new recruiting-marketing platform combined with greater use of social media, is intended to enhance our employer brand and educate candidates on why they should work for us. Our ongoing efforts to develop a diverse and inclusive workforce not only strengthens the engagement of our current employee population but helps make us an attractive employer where differing insights and opinions are valued. Valuing different perspectives and the impact of broader employee influence on how decisions are made, are two areas for the company to focus on for successful retention. Providing for robust career development opportunities and effective succession planning is expected to be another important part of our retention efforts.\nLife and Annuity\nLife insurance and annuity are mainstay segments, as they have been during our long history. We believe that the combination of predictable and decreasing mortality rates, positive cash flow generation for many years after policy issue and favorable persistency characteristics suggest a viable and profitable future for these lines of business.\nEffective management of invested assets and associated liabilities using crediting rates and, where applicable, financial hedging instruments (which we use as economic hedges of equity-indexed life and annuity products), is important to the success of our life and annuity segments. Asset disintermediation\u201d, the risk of large outflows of cash at times when it is disadvantageous to us to dispose of invested assets, is a risk associated with these segments.\nDemographics: We believe a key driver shaping the actions of the life insurance industry is the rising income protection, wealth accumulation and insurance needs of retiring Baby Boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964). As a result of increasing longevity and uncertainty regarding the Social Security System and an ongoing transition from defined benefit pension plans to 401(k) type retirement plans, retirees will need to accumulate sufficient savings to support retirement income requirements.\nWe believe we are well positioned to address the Baby Boomers' increasing need for savings tools and income protection. We believe that our overall financial strength and broad distribution channels position us to respond with a variety of products for individuals approaching retirement age, who seek information to plan for and manage their retirement needs. We believe our products that offer guaranteed income flows for life, including single premium immediate annuities, are well positioned to serve this market.\nCompetitive Pressures: In recent years, the competitive landscape of the U.S. life insurance industry has shifted. Established insurers are competing against each other and also against new market entrants that are developing products to attract the interest of the growing number of retirees. Competition exists in terms of retaining and acquiring consumers' business and also in terms of access to producers and distributors. Consolidation among distributors coupled with the aging sales force remains a challenge among insurers. In addition, the increased technological sophistication of consumers necessitates that insurers and distributors invest significant resources in technology to adapt to consumer expectations. We believe we possess sufficient scale, financial strength, resources and flexibility to compete effectively.\nThe annuity market is also highly competitive. In addition to aggressive interest crediting rates and new product features on annuities, there is competition from other financial service firms. Insurers continue to evaluate their distribution channels and the way they deliver products to consumers.\nWe believe we will continue to be competitive in the life and annuity markets through our broad line of products, diverse distribution channels, and consistent high level of customer service. We modify our products to meet customer needs and to expand our reach where we believe we can obtain profitable growth.\nHealth\nMost of the major provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and a reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Healthcare Acts\u201d), phased in effective January 1, 2014. The Healthcare Acts mandated broad changes in the delivery of health care benefits that have impacted our business model including our relationships with current and future customers, producers, and health care providers, as well as our products, services and processes. As a result, the Healthcare Acts generated new opportunities in the limited benefit and supplemental product markets. In recent years, we built a portfolio of such products to be sold in the worksite market as well as to individuals. We feel that recent changes to the Healthcare Acts that removed the tax consequences for not having health coverage and the removal of limitations on Short Term Medical products could significantly increase our production. We also continue to expand our presence in the worksite market to generate new opportunities in the broker market, as well as developing and implementing a captive sales force.\nWe expect our Managing General Underwriter ( MGU\u201d) business to remain stable during 2019. We generally retain only 10% of the MGU premium and risk. The majority of the revenue generated from this business is fee income included in Other income\u201d of the Health segment's operating results.\nProperty and Casualty\nWe offer our personal and commercial property and casualty lines of business primarily through exclusive agents. We favor a balanced, focused and collaborative approach to both growth and profitability through the development of successful agencies.\nTo acquire and retain profitable business, we use sophisticated pricing models and risk segmentation, along with a focused distribution force. We believe this approach allows us to make product enhancements and offer programs that are tailored to our target markets while charging an appropriate premium for the risk.\nDemand for property and casualty credit-related insurance products continues to increase. We continue to update credit-related insurance product offerings and pricing to meet changing market needs, as well as adding new agents to expand market share in the credit-related insurance market. We are reviewing and implementing procedures to enhance customer service while, at the same time, looking for efficiencies to reduce administrative costs.\nCompetition: The property and casualty insurance industry remains highly competitive. Despite the competitive environment, we expect to identify profitable opportunities through our strong distribution channels, expanding geographic coverage, marketing efforts, new product development and pricing sophistication.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that often involve a significant degree of judgment. These estimates and judgments include expectations of current and future mortality, morbidity, persistency, claims and claim adjustment expenses, recoverability of receivables, investment returns and interest rates which extend well into the future. In developing these estimates, there is inherent uncertainty, and material changes to facts and circumstances may develop. Although variability is inherent in these estimates, we believe the amounts as reported are appropriate, based upon the facts available upon compilation of the consolidated financial statements.\nOn an ongoing basis, management reviews the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the financial statements. If current facts and circumstances warrant modifications in estimates and assumptions, our financial position and results of operations as reported in the consolidated financial statements could change significantly.\nA description of these critical accounting estimates is presented below. Also, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nReserves\nLife and Annuity Reserves\nLife Reserving-Principal assumptions used in the determination of the reserves for future policy benefits are mortality, policy lapse rates, investment return, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type. Reserves for incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) claims on life policies are calculated using historical claims information. Reserves for interest-sensitive and variable universal life insurance policies are equal to the current account value calculated for the policyholder. Some of our universal life policies contain secondary guarantees, for which additional reserves are recorded based on the term of the policy.\nAnnuity Reserving-Reserves for payout annuities with more than insignificant amounts of mortality risk are calculated in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for limited pay insurance contracts. Benefit and maintenance expense reserves are calculated by using assumptions reflecting our expectations of future costs, including an appropriate margin for adverse deviation. These assumptions are locked-in at issue and generally reflect pricing assumptions from that period. If the resulting reserve would otherwise cause profits to be recognized at the issue date, additional reserves are recorded. The resulting recognition of profits would be gradual over the expected life of the contract.\nReserves for fixed deferred annuities are established equivalent to the account value held on behalf of the policyholder. Reserves for indexed annuities are calculated in accordance with derivative accounting guidance which defines a host liability for return of principal and guaranteed interest, and an embedded derivative liability for funded benefits in excess of the host guarantee. Additional reserves for benefits that can exceed contract fund value, such as lifetime income riders, are determined as needed in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The profit recognition on deferred annuity contracts is gradual over the expected life of the contract. No immediate profit is recognized on the sale of the contract.\nKey Assumptions-The following assumptions reflect our best estimates and may impact our life and annuity reserves:\n \u2022 Future lapse rates will remain reasonably consistent with our current expectations; \n \u2022 Mortality rates will remain reasonably consistent within standard industry mortality table ranges; and \n \u2022 Future interest spreads will remain reasonably consistent with our current expectations. \nRecoverability-At least annually, we test the adequacy of the net benefit reserves (policy benefit reserves less DAC) recorded for life insurance and annuity products. To perform the tests, we use our current best-estimate assumptions as to policyholder mortality, persistency, maintenance expenses and invested asset returns.\nFor interest-sensitive business, best-estimate assumptions are updated to reflect observed changes based on experience studies and current economic conditions. We reflect the effect of such assumption changes in DAC and reserve balances accordingly. Due to the long-term nature of many of the liabilities, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in profitability. In particular, changes in estimates of the future invested asset return have a large effect on the degree of reserve adequacy and DAC recoverability.\nFor traditional business, a lock-in\u201d principle applies, whereby the assumptions used to calculate the benefit reserves and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience. These include margins for adverse deviation in the event that actual experience differs from the original assumptions.\nHealth Reserves\nHealth reserves are established using the following methods:\nCompletion Factor Approach-This method assumes that the historical claim patterns will be an accurate representation of unpaid claim liabilities. An estimate of the unpaid claims is calculated by subtracting period-to-date paid claims from an estimate of the ultimate complete\u201d payment for all incurred claims in the period. Completion factors are calculated which complete\u201d the current period-to-date payment totals for each incurred month to estimate the ultimate expected payout.\nTabular Claims Reserves-This method is used to calculate the reserves for disability income blocks of business. These reserves rely on published valuation continuance tables created using industry experience regarding assumptions of continued morbidity and subsequent recovery. Reserves are calculated by applying these continuance tables, along with appropriate company experience adjustments, to the stream of contractual benefit payments. These expected benefit payments are discounted at the required interest rate.\nFuture Policy Benefits-Reserves are equal to the aggregate of the present value of expected future benefit payments, less the present value of expected future premiums. Morbidity and termination assumptions are based on our experience or published valuation tables when available and appropriate.\nPremium Deficiency Reserves-Deficiency reserves are established when the expected future claim payments and expenses for a classification of policies are in excess of the expected premiums for these policies. The determination of a deficiency reserve takes into consideration the likelihood of premium rate increases, the timing of these increases, and the expected benefit utilization patterns. We have established premium deficiency reserves for portions of the major medical business and the long-term care business that are in run-off. The assumptions and methods used to determine the deficiency reserves are reviewed periodically for reasonableness, and the reserve amount is monitored against emerging losses.\nProperty and Casualty Reserves\nReserves for Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense ( CAE\u201d)-Property and casualty reserves are established to provide for the estimated cost of settling and paying both reported ( case\u201d) as well as incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) claims. The two major categories of CAE are defense and cost containment expense, and adjusting and other expense. The details of property and casualty reserves are shown below (in thousands):\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ceded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ceded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Case\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>858,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>800,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>544,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>481,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IBNR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>409,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>382,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>990,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>921,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>953,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>864,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCase Reserves-Reserves for reported losses are determined on either a judgment or a formula basis, depending on the timing and type of the loss. The formula reserve is a fixed amount for each claim of a given type based on historical paid loss data for similar claims with a provision for claim inflation. Judgment reserve amounts replace initial formula reserves and are set for each loss based on facts and circumstances of each case and the expectation of damages. We regularly monitor the adequacy of reserves on a case-by-case basis and change the amount of such reserves as necessary.\nIBNR-IBNR reserves are estimated based on many variables including: historical statistical information, inflation, legal environment, economic conditions, trends in claim severity and frequency as well as other factors affecting the adequacy of claim reserves. Loss and premium data is aggregated by exposure class and by accident year. IBNR reserves are estimated by projecting ultimate losses on each class of business and subtracting paid losses and case reserves. Our overall reserve practice provides for ongoing claims evaluation and adjustment based on the development of related data and other relevant information pertaining to claims. Adjustments in aggregate reserves, if any, are included in the results of operations of the period during which such adjustments are made.\nWe believe we conservatively reflect the potential uncertainty generated by volatility in our loss development profiles when selecting loss development factor patterns for each line of business. See Note 12, Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe evaluation process to determine reserves involves the collaboration of underwriting, claims and actuarial departments. The process also includes consultation with independent actuarial firms as part of our process of gaining reassurance that claims and CAE reserves estimate sufficiently, all obligations arising from all losses incurred as of year-end. The independent actuarial firm completes the Statements of Actuarial Opinion required by individual state insurance regulations at each year-end, opining that the recorded statutory claims and CAE reserves are reasonable.\nPremium Deficiency Reserve-Deficiency reserves are recorded when the expected claims payments and policy maintenance costs for a product line exceed the expected premiums for that product line. The estimation of a deficiency reserve considers the current profitability of a product line using anticipated claims, CAE, and policy maintenance costs. The assumptions and methods used to determine the need for deficiency reserves are reviewed periodically for reasonableness. There were no reserves of this type at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nProperty and Casualty Reserving Methodology-The following methods are utilized:\n \u2022 Initial Expected Loss Ratio-This method calculates an estimate of ultimate losses by applying an estimated loss ratio to actual earned premium for each calendar/accident year. This method is appropriate for classes of business where the actual paid or reported loss experience is not yet mature enough to influence initial expectations of the ultimate loss ratios. \n \u2022 Bornhuetter-Ferguson-This method uses as a starting point an assumed initial expected loss ratio method and blends in the loss ratio implied by the claims experience to date by using loss development patterns based on our historical experience. This method is generally appropriate where there are few reported claims and an unstable pattern of reported losses. \n \u2022 Loss or Expense Development (Chain Ladder)-This method uses actual loss or defense and cost containment expense data and the historical development profiles on older accident periods to project more recent, less developed periods to their ultimate total. This method is appropriate when there is a relatively stable pattern of loss and expense emergence and a relatively large number of reported claims. \n \u2022 Ratio of Paid Defense and Cost Containment Expense to Paid Loss Development-This method uses the ratio of paid defense and cost containment expense to paid loss data and the historical development profiles on older accident periods to project more recent, less developed periods to their ultimate total. In this method, an ultimate ratio of paid defense and cost containment expense to paid loss is selected for each accident period. The selected paid defense and cost containment expense to paid loss ratio is then applied to the selected ultimate loss for each accident period to estimate the ultimate defense and cost containment expense. Paid defense and cost containment expense is then subtracted from the ultimate defense and cost containment expense to calculate the unpaid defense and cost containment expense for that accident period. \n \u2022 Calendar Year Paid Adjusting and Other Expense to Paid Loss-This method uses a selected prior calendar years' paid expense to paid loss ratio to project ultimate loss adjustment expenses for adjusting and other expense. A percentage of the selected ratio is applied to the case reserves (depending on the line of insurance) and 100% to the indicated IBNR reserves. These ratios assume that a percentage of the expense is incurred when a claim is opened and the remaining percentage is paid throughout the claim's life. \nThe basis of our selected single point best estimate on a particular line of business is often a blended result from two or more methods (e.g. weighted averages). Our estimate is highly dependent on actuarial and management judgment as to which method(s) is most appropriate for a particular accident year and class of business. Our methodology changes over time, as new information emerges regarding underlying loss activity and other factors.\nKey Assumptions-The following assumptions may impact our property and casualty reserves:\n \u2022 Stability of future inflation rates and consistency with historical inflation norms; \n \u2022 The expected loss development patterns; \n \u2022 Consistent claims handling, reserving and payment processes; \n \u2022 No unusual growth patterns or unexpected changes in the mix of business; and \n \u2022 No significant prospective changes in laws that would significantly affect future payouts.  The loss ratio selections and development profiles are developed primarily using our historical claims and loss experience. These development patterns reflect prior inflation rates, and could be impacted by future changes in inflation rates, particularly those relating to medical care costs, automobile repair parts and building or home material costs. These assumptions have not been modified from the preceding periods and are consistent with historical loss reserve development patterns.\nFor non-credit lines of business, future inflation rates could vary from our assumption of relatively stable rates. Unexpected changes in future inflation rates could impact our financial position and liquidity, and we measure the sensitivity of our reserve levels to unexpected changes in inflation. The impacts of future inflation for a 1.0% decrease and 3.0% increase over the implied inflation rate in the December 31, 2018 gross loss reserve balance are as follows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cumulative Increase (Decrease) in Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0% Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0% Increase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automobile\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,038\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Homeowner\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,578\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agricultural Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,544\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automobile\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,799\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe analysis of our credit insurance lines of business quantifies the estimated impact on gross loss reserves of a reasonably likely scenario of varying the ratio applied to the earned premium to determine the IBNR reserves at December 31, 2018. IBNR reserving methodology for this line of business focuses primarily on the use of a ratio applied to the unearned premium for each credit insurance product. The selected ratios are based on historical loss and claim data. In our analysis, we varied this ratio by +/- 5% across all credit insurance products combined. The results of our analysis show an increase or decrease in gross reserves across all accident years combined of approximately $10.1 million.\nIt is not appropriate to aggregate the impacts shown in our sensitivity analysis, as our lines of business are not directly correlated. The variations are not meant to be a best-case\u201d or worst-case\u201d scenario, and it is possible that future variations will be more or less than the amounts in the sensitivity analysis. While these are possible scenarios based on the information available to us at this time, we do not believe the reader should consider our sensitivity analysis an actual reserve range.\nManagement believes our reserves at December 31, 2018 are adequate. New information, regulation, events or circumstances unknown at the original valuation date, however, may result in future development resulting in ultimate losses being significantly greater or less than the recorded reserves at December 31, 2018.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nWe had a DAC asset of approximately $1.50 billion and $1.37 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 10, Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nWe believe the estimates used in our DAC calculations provide an example of how variations in assumptions and estimates would affect our business. The following table displays the sensitivity of reasonably likely changes in assumptions in the DAC amortization for our long-tail business at December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease) in DAC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in future investment margins of 25 basis points\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in future investment margins of 25 basis points\n</td> <td>(39,335\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in future life mortality by 1%\n</td> <td>1,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in future life mortality by 1%\n</td> <td>(1,520\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReinsurance\nWe manage our insurance underwriting risk exposures by purchasing reinsurance. We manage counterparty risk by entering into agreements with reinsurers we consider creditworthy, generally measured by the individual entity or entities' financial strength rating. However, we do not require a specified minimum rating. We monitor the concentrations of the reinsurers and reduce the participation percentage of lower-rated and unrated companies when appropriate in our judgment. While we believe we currently have no significant credit risk related to reinsurance counterparties, we continue to monitor their financial condition.\nSome of our reinsurance contracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate the participation with reinsurers whose ratings are downgraded. Information used in our risk assessment is comprised of industry ratings, recent news and reports, and a limited review of financial statements. We also may require reinsurers not licensed in our state of domicile or with whom we have limited experience, to provide letters of credit, trust agreements, or cash advances to fund their share of reserves.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment\nA decline in the fair value of fixed maturity investment securities below their cost basis is evaluated on an ongoing basis to determine if the decline is other-than-temporary. A number of assumptions and estimates inherent in evaluating impairments are used to determine if they are other-than-temporary, which include 1) our ability and intent to hold the investment securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; 2) the expected recoverability of principal and interest; 3) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost basis; 4) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; and 5) the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position, including market conditions, which could affect liquidity.\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities is determined by management using one of the three primary sources of information: the quoted prices in active markets; third-party pricing services; or independent broker quotations. Estimated fair value of securities based on quoted prices in active markets is readily and regularly available; therefore, valuation of these securities generally does not involve management judgment. For securities without quoted prices, fair value measurement is determined using third-party pricing services' proprietary pricing applications. Typical inputs used by the models are relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmark pricing of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. Any securities remaining unpriced after utilizing the first two pricing methods are submitted to independent brokers for prices. We have analyzed the third-party pricing services and independent brokers' valuation methodologies and related inputs, and have evaluated the various types of securities in our investment portfolio to determine an appropriate fair value hierarchy level based upon trading activity and the observability of market inputs. Management completes certain tests throughout the year and at year-end to determine that prices provided by our pricing services are reasonable.\nWe utilize over-the-counter equity options to hedge our exposure to equity-indexed universal life and equity-indexed deferred annuity benefits, and the fair values for these options are sourced from broker quotations. Accounting guidance requires a fair value calculation as part of equity-indexed policy reserves. This is called the value of embedded derivative (or VED) and the other part of the indexed policy reserve is called the host reserve. The embedded derivative represents future benefit cash flows in excess of minimum guarantee cash flows. The host covers the minimum guarantee cash flows. Both the VED and the host reserve are calculated by a vendor-sourced reserve valuation system. The VED calculation model incorporates assumptions related to current option pricing (such as implied volatility and LIBOR/swap curve), future policyholder behavior (such as surrenders and withdrawals), and factors affecting the value of future indexed interest periods (such as option budgets).\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe Company has frozen each of its defined benefit pension plans. Our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related costs covering our employees are estimated using actuarial concepts in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. The discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense and/or liability measurements. Each year, these key assumptions are reevaluated to determine whether they reflect the best estimates for the current period. Changes in the methodology used to determine the best estimates are made when facts or circumstances change. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined using the building-block method which is described further in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices, Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans. In 2017, the Company commenced a one-time window offering to terminated, vested participants of our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The offer allowed participants to take a lump sum or annuity payout which was funded from pension plan assets. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18, Pension and Postretirement Benefits for additional details.\nLitigation Contingencies\nBased on information currently available, we believe that amounts ultimately paid, if any, arising from existing and currently potential litigation would not have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. However, it should be noted that the frequency of large damage awards, which bear little or no relation to the economic damages incurred by plaintiffs, continues to create the potential for an unpredictable judgment in any given lawsuit. It is possible that, if the defenses in these lawsuits are not successful, and the judgments are greater than we anticipate, the resulting liability could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nFederal Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is based on income at statutory tax rates, adjusted for non-taxable and non-deductible items, and tax credits. Management's best estimate of future events and their impact is included in our effective tax rate. Certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, and completion of tax audits could have an impact on our estimates and effective tax rate. Audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed.\nGAAP requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, and if so, the amount of such valuation allowance. There were no material valuation allowances recorded during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that our remaining deferred tax assets will be realized and that no additional valuation allowance is necessary as of December 31, 2018.\nOn December 22, 2017, the federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Reform\u201d). Tax Reform made broad and complex changes to federal corporate tax law and resulted in changes to our overall tax obligations. Most notably, Tax Reform reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Other provisions affecting corporations include, but are not limited to, changes to the deductibility of interest expense, limitations on certain deductions for executive compensation and the repeal of the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. In addition, there were several changes that are specific to insurance companies, namely changes to the proration formula used to determine the amount of dividends eligible for the dividends-received deduction, and changes to the calculation of tax reserves associated with policyholder liabilities.\nSubsequent to enactment, the Securities Exchange Commission introduced Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d). SAB 118 provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the Tax Reform where our determinations were incomplete but we were able to determine a reasonable estimate. A final determination is required to be made within a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment of Tax Reform. In 2017, we recorded a provisional tax benefit of $206.4 million in accordance with the guidance in SAB 118. As a result of Tax Reform, we remeasured our existing deferred tax balances to the new 21% corporate income tax rate. Additionally, we made a reasonable estimate to evaluate the impact of Tax Reform on our 2017 financial statements. There were no adjustments in 2018 to the provisional tax benefit we recorded in 2017.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following sets forth the consolidated results of operations (in

in the period indicated.  A positive amount of net change indicates less expense was deferred than amortized and represents an increase to expenses in the period indicated.\nIncome before federal income taxes and other items ( Earnings\u201d)\nEarnings decreased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of net unrealized losses on equity securities in income as required by new accounting guidance. The earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018 were also impacted by a reduced interest margin resulting from a decrease in the S&P 500 index on equity-indexed products in our Annuity segment as well as losses impacting our homeowners, commercial auto and GAP lines of business in our Property and Casualty segment. Earnings increased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in net investment income and realized investment gains. The increase in net investment income was attributable to increased income on mortgage loans. The increase in realized investment gains was attributable to an increase in the sale of bonds, equity securities, and certain real estate holdings.\nLife\nLife segment financial results for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change over prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PREMIUMS AND OTHER REVENUES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>350,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>328,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>318,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other policy revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>270,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(60,310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>245,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>227,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,654\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>189\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total premiums and other revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>856,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>811,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>844,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,592\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BENEFITS, LOSSES AND EXPENSES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>417,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>410,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>429,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,661\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholders' account balances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,716\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions for acquiring and servicing policies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in deferred policy acquisition costs (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,893\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49,786\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53,673\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total benefits, losses and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>787,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>771,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>816,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44,583\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before federal income taxes and other items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) A negative amount of net change indicates more expense was deferred than amortized and represents a decrease to expenses in the period indicated.

Both events resulted in impacts to other policy revenues, policyholder benefits, and change in deferred policy acquisition costs. Neither event had significant impacts on operating income.\nThe unlocking of best estimate assumptions on the interest sensitive block impacted other policy revenues, policyholder benefits, and change in deferred policy acquisition costs. The Company unlocked assumptions in 2017 and 2018 with favorable operating income impacts of $5 million and $6 million, respectively.\nEarnings\nEarnings increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher premiums and other policy revenues. Earnings increased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in policyholder benefits.\nPremiums and other revenues\nPremiums increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 and 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to continued growth in renewal premium on traditional life products.\nOther policy revenues, which include cost of insurance charges, earned policy service fees and surrender charges, have also increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 as the size of our interest sensitive block continues to grow, through increased sales and aging of the in-force. The decrease in other policy revenue during 2017 compared to 2016 is due to the change in estimates discussed in \"Items affecting the comparability of life results\" section.\nLife insurance sales\nThe following table presents life insurance sales as measured by annualized premium, a non-GAAP measure used by the insurance industry, which allows a comparison of new policies sold by an insurance company during the period (in thousands):\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change over prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Traditional Life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(952\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal Life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indexed UL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Recurring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single and excess(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit life(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(613\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(346\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) These are weighted amounts representing 10% of single and excess premiums and 31% of credit life premiums. In 2018, credit life weighting changed from 15% to 31% due to an increase in monthly outstanding balance; 2017 amounts have been updated for comparison purposes.\nLife insurance sales measure activity associated with gaining new insurance business in the current period, and includes deposits received related to interest sensitive life and universal life-type products. In contrast, GAAP premium revenues are associated with policies sold in current and prior periods, and deposits received related to interest sensitive life and universal life-type products are recorded in a policyholder account which is reflected as a liability. Therefore, a reconciliation of premium revenues and insurance sales is not meaningful.\nLife insurance sales increased during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increased Indexed Universal Life sales. Life insurance sales increased in all major product lines during 2017 compared to 2016.\nBenefits, losses and expenses\nPolicyholder benefits increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 attributable to an increase in the severity of claims. Policyholder benefits decreased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the change in estimates.\nCommissions increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 which was commensurate with the increase in indexed universal life and universal life sales.
