Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding our results of operations and changes in financial position for the past three years. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page 70 of this report and the supplemental financial data contained in Tables 1 through 22 beginning on page 53 of this report. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. The following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nOverview - 2019 Compared to 2018\nWe reported net income per diluted common share of $3.10 in 2019, a 3.0% increase compared to 2018.

The higher earnings in 2019 were primarily related to higher net interest income associated with our growth.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $216.2 million, a 4.2% increase from the $207.4 million recorded in 2018. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to growth in interest-earning assets. Also, see the section entitled Net Interest Income\u201d for additional information.\nOur net interest margin (tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets) was 4.00% for 2019 compared to 4.09% for 2018. The decrease in the net interest margin realized in 2019 was primarily due to a combination of lower loan discount accretion and lower asset yields.\nWe recorded a provision for loan losses of $2.3 million in 2019 compared to negative provision for loan losses of $3.6 million (reduction of the allowance for loan losses) in 2018. The negative provision for 2018 was due primarily to several large loan recoveries realized in the first quarter of 2018 totaling $3.7 million. Generally, our provisions for loan losses have been low over the past several years due to strong asset quality, including low loan charge-offs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, noninterest income amounted to $59.5 million compared to $58.9 million for 2018, an increase of 1.0%. Increases were experienced in i) service charges on deposit accounts due to strong deposit growth, ii) interchange income due to increased credit and debit card usage, and iii) in fees from presold mortgages due to higher mortgage origination activity. Those increases were substantially offset by lower SBA loan sale gains and lower SBA consulting fees. See the section entitled Noninterest Income\u201d for additional information.\nNoninterest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $157.2 million compared to $156.5 million in 2018, an increase of 0.5%. A 5.4% increase in salaries expense associated with wage increases and the growth of the Company was substantially offset by lower merger and acquisition expenses and lower intangibles amortization expense. See the section entitled Noninterest Expense\u201d for additional information.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2019 amounted to $6.1 billion, a 4.8% increase from a year earlier. Loan growth for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $204.4 million, or 4.8%, and deposit growth amounted to $272.0 million, or 5.8%. Within deposits, our retail deposits (excludes brokered deposits and internet time deposits) grew 9.7% during 2019, with 14.8% growth in noninterest-bearing checking accounts. As a result of the strong retail deposit growth, we reduced our level of brokered deposits by $153.7 million, or 64.1%, from $239.9 million at December 31, 2018 to $86.1 million at December 31, 2019. Internet time deposits decreased from $3.4 million at December 31, 2018 to $0.7 million at December 31, 2019. Additionally, we paid down borrowings by $106 million, or 26.0%, during 2019.\nDuring 2019, we repurchased 281,593 shares of the Company's common stock at an average price of $35.51, which totaled $10 million. As of December 31, 2019, we had $40 million of additional share repurchase authority, which has an expiration date of December 31, 2020.\nOverview - 2018 Compared to 2017\nWe reported net income per diluted common share of $3.01 in 2018, a 65.4% increase compared to the $1.82 per share earnings for 2017. In 2018, a full year of earnings and cost efficiencies realized from two significant 2017 acquisitions drove the increase in earnings. Our loan balances, total assets and deposits all grew 5%-6%.\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Highlights\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands except per share data)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>207,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (reversal) for loan losses\n</td> <td>(3,589\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest income\n</td> <td>58,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest expenses\n</td> <td>156,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>113,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>24,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>3.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balances At Year End\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,864,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,547,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans\n</td> <td>4,249,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,042,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits\n</td> <td>4,659,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,406,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratios\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average assets\n</td> <td>1.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average common equity\n</td> <td>12.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest margin (taxable-equivalent)\n</td> <td>4.09\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.08\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>n/m - not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded net income of $89.3 million, or $3.01 per diluted common share, an increase of 65.4% in earnings per share from the $46.0 million, or $1.82 per diluted common share, for 2017. The higher earnings in 2018 were primarily due to the acquisitions of Carolina Bank on March 3, 2017 and Asheville Savings Bank on October 1, 2017. The assets, liabilities and earnings for the acquisitions were recorded beginning on their respective acquisition dates. Therefore, the year 2018 included twelve months of earnings from the acquisition compared to only a partial year in 2017. Earnings and earnings per share for 2018 also benefited\nfrom operational efficiencies that were realized in the integration of the acquisitions that became fully realized in the final three quarters of 2018.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to $207.4 million, a 25.9% increase from the $164.7 million recorded in 2017. The increase in net interest income was due primarily to growth in interest-earning assets, which for the twelve month period was impacted by assets acquired in the Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank acquisitions. Our net interest margin (tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets) of 4.09% for 2018 did not vary significantly from the 4.08% realized for 2017. Also, see the section entitled Net Interest Income\u201d for additional information.\nWe recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $3.6 million (reduction of the allowance for loan losses) in 2018 compared to a provision for loan losses of $0.7 million in 2017. The negative provision for 2018 was due primarily to several large loan recoveries realized in the first quarter of 2018 totaling $3.7 million. See \"Provision for Loan Losses\" for additional discussion.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, noninterest income amounted to $58.9 million compared to $49.2 million for 2017. The primary reasons for the increase in core noninterest income in 2018 were the previously discussed bank acquisitions and an insurance agency acquisition completed late in 2017, as well as higher income realized from SBA consulting fees and SBA loan sale gains. See the section entitled Noninterest Income\u201d for additional information.\nNoninterest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to $156.5 million compared to $145.5 million in 2017. Most categories of noninterest expense experienced general increases in 2018 due to our growth, primarily due to the previously noted acquisitions. Also impacting expenses were other growth initiatives, including continued growth of SBA Complete and the SBA Lending Division. See the section entitled Noninterest Expense\u201d for additional information.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our effective tax rates were 21.3% and 32.1%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 was due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in December 2017 and reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2018 amounted to $5.9 billion, a 5.7% increase from a year earlier. Loan growth for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to $207 million, or 5.1%, and deposit growth amounted to $252.4 million, or 5.7%.\nOutlook for 2020\nOur outlook for 2020 is generally stable. We believe our local economies and business conditions will continue to be healthy and generally favorable and that we will continue to experience solid organic loan and deposit growth in 2020. However, we face challenges to growing our earnings primarily due to the interest rate environment and a likely increase in our provision for loan losses.\nThe Federal Reserve decreased short-term interest rates by 75 basis points in the second half of 2019 and longer term interest rates in the marketplace also declined in 2019 and are near historic lows. The lower interest rates have resulted in declining asset yields, which is expected to continue into 2020. On the funding side, prior to the interest rate declines, we already had a very low cost of funds and our ability to further lower those costs has been limited. These factors resulted in our net interest margin declining in the second half of 2019. We expect these net interest margin pressures to continue into 2020, which would negatively impact the earnings growth we would expect from projected increases in our loans and deposits.\nIn recent years, we have experienced improving trends in the levels of our nonperforming assets and loan losses have been low, and accordingly, we've recorded minimal provisions for loan losses. While we do not currently expect a significant rise in loan delinquencies or loan losses, we believe it is likely that we will need to record higher levels of provisions for loan losses than recent years to provide for loan growth and more normal levels of losses. Any credit deterioration would result in further increases. Furthermore, we believe the new accounting standard for reserving for loan losses, commonly referred to as CECL, will generally result in higher provisions for loan losses, especially during periods of loan growth.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and with general practices followed by the banking industry. Certain of these principles involve a significant amount of judgment and may involve the use of estimates based on our best assumptions at the time of the estimation. The allowance for loan losses, intangible assets, and the fair value and discount accretion of acquired loans are three policies we have identified as being more sensitive in terms of judgments and estimates, taking into account their overall potential impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nDue to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved, we have identified the accounting for the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses as an accounting policy critical to our consolidated financial statements. The provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio.\nOur determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based primarily on a mathematical model that estimates the appropriate allowance for loan losses. This model has two components. The first component involves the estimation of losses on individually evaluated impaired loans.\u201d A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement. A loan is specifically evaluated for an appropriate valuation allowance if the loan balance is above a prescribed evaluation threshold (which varies based on credit quality, accruing status, troubled debt restructured status, purchased credit impaired status, and type of collateral) and the loan is determined to be impaired. The estimated valuation allowance is the difference, if any, between the loan balance outstanding and the value of the impaired loan as determined by either 1) an estimate of the cash flows that we expect to receive from the borrower discounted at the loan's effective rate, or 2) in the case of a collateral-dependent loan, the fair value of the collateral.\nThe second component of the allowance model is an estimate of losses for all loans not considered to be impaired loans ( general reserve loans\u201d). General reserve loans are segregated into pools by loan type and risk grade and estimated loss percentages are assigned to each loan pool based on historical losses. The historical loss percentages are then adjusted for any environmental factors used to reflect changes in the collectability of the portfolio not captured by historical data.\nThe reserves estimated for individually evaluated impaired loans are then added to the reserve estimated for general reserve loans. This becomes our allocated allowance.\u201d The allocated allowance is compared to the actual allowance for loan losses recorded on our books and any adjustment necessary for the recorded allowance to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio is recorded as a provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses is a direct charge to earnings in the period recorded. Any remaining difference between the allocated allowance and the actual allowance for loan losses recorded on our books is our unallocated allowance.\u201d\nPurchased loans are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. Therefore, amounts deemed uncollectible at the acquisition date represent a discount to the loan value and become a part of the fair value calculation. Subsequent decreases in the amount expected to be collected result in a provision for loan losses with a corresponding increase in the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent increases in the amount expected to be collected are accreted into income over the life of the loan and this accretion is referred to as loan discount accretion.\u201d\nWithin the purchased loan portfolio, loans are deemed purchased credit impaired at acquisition if the bank believes it will not be able to collect all contractual cash flows. Performing loans with an unamortized discount or premium that are not deemed purchased credit impaired are considered to be purchased performing loans. Purchased credit impaired loans are individually evaluated as impaired loans, as described above, while purchased performing loans are evaluated as general reserve loans. For purchased performing loan pools, any computed allowance that is in excess of remaining net discounts is a component of the allocated allowance.\nAlthough we use the best information available to make evaluations, future material adjustments may be necessary if economic, operational, or other conditions change. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to\nrecognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners' judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations.\nFor further discussion, see Nonperforming Assets\u201d and Summary of Loan Loss Experience\u201d below.\nThe above discussion reflects our allowance for loan losses policy in effect for 2019. In 2020, our allowance for loan loss policy will be based on the current expected credit losses accounting guidance. See \"Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience\" for additional discussion.\nIntangible Assets\nDue to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved, we have also identified the accounting for intangible assets as an accounting policy critical to our consolidated financial statements.\nWhen we complete an acquisition transaction, the excess of the purchase price over the amount by which the fair market value of assets acquired exceeds the fair market value of liabilities assumed represents an intangible asset. We must then determine the identifiable portions of the intangible asset, with any remaining amount classified as goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets associated with these acquisitions are generally amortized over the estimated life of the related asset, whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment, but not systematically amortized. Assuming no goodwill impairment, it is beneficial to our future earnings to have a lower amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets and higher amount of goodwill as opposed to having a higher amount considered to be identifiable intangible assets and a lower amount classified as goodwill.\nThe primary identifiable intangible asset we typically record in connection with a whole bank or bank branch acquisition is the value of the core deposit intangible, whereas when we acquire an insurance agency or a consulting firm, as we did in 2016 and 2017, the primary identifiable intangible asset is the value of the acquired customer list. Determining the amount of identifiable intangible assets and their average lives involves multiple assumptions and estimates and is typically determined by performing a discounted cash flow analysis, which involves a combination of any or all of the following assumptions: customer attrition/runoff, alternative funding costs, deposit servicing costs, and discount rates. We typically engage a third party consultant to assist in each analysis. For the whole bank and bank branch transactions recorded to date, the core deposit intangibles have generally been estimated to have a life ranging from seven to ten years, with an accelerated rate of amortization. For insurance agency acquisitions, the identifiable intangible assets related to the customer lists were determined to have a life of ten to fifteen years, with amortization occurring on a straight-line basis. For SBA Complete, the consulting firm we acquired in 2016, the identifiable intangible asset related to the customer list was determined to have a life of approximately seven years, with amortization occurring on a straight-line basis.\nSubsequent to the initial recording of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, we amortize the identifiable intangible assets over their estimated average lives, as discussed above. In addition, on at least an annual basis, with the annual evaluation occurring on October 31 of each year, goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their related carrying value, including goodwill. We have three reporting units - 1) First Bank with $222.7 million in goodwill, 2) First Bank Insurance with $7.4 million in goodwill, and 3) SBA activities, including SBA Complete and our SBA Lending Division, with $4.3 million in goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit were ever to exceed its fair value, we would determine whether the implied fair value of the goodwill, using a discounted cash flow analysis, exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss would be recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Performing such a discounted cash flow analysis would involve the significant use of estimates and assumptions.\nIn our 2019 goodwill impairment evaluation, we concluded that the goodwill for each of our reporting units was not impaired.\nWe review identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our policy is that an impairment loss is recognized, equal to the difference between the asset's carrying amount and its fair value, if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Estimating future cash flows involves the use of multiple estimates and assumptions, such as those listed above.\nFair Value and Discount Accretion of Acquired Loans\nWe consider the determination of the initial fair value of acquired loans and the subsequent discount accretion of the purchased loans to involve a high degree of judgment and complexity.\nWe determine fair value accounting estimates of newly assumed assets and liabilities in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. However, the amount that we realize on these assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in our financial statements, based upon the timing of collections on the acquired loans in future periods. Because of inherent credit losses and interest rate marks associated with acquired loans, the amount that we record as the fair values for the loans is generally less than the contractual unpaid principal balance due from the borrowers, with the difference being referred to as the discount\u201d on the acquired loans. For non-impaired purchased loans, we accrete the discount over the lives of the loans in a manner consistent with the guidance for accounting for loan origination fees and costs.\nFor purchased credit-impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans, the excess of the cash flows initially expected to be collected over the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date (i.e., the accretable yield) is accreted into interest income over the estimated remaining life of the loans using the effective yield method, provided that the timing and the amount of future cash flows is reasonably estimable. Accordingly, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual and they are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized under accounting for PCI loans and not to contractual interest payments. The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference.\nSubsequent to an acquisition, estimates of cash flows expected to be collected are updated periodically based on updated assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. If there is a decrease in cash flows expected to be collected, the provision for loan losses is charged, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. If the Company has a probable increase in cash flows expected to be collected, we will first reverse any previously established allowance for loan losses and then increase interest income as a prospective yield adjustment over the remaining life of the loan. The impact of changes in variable interest rates is recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income.\nMerger and Acquisition Activity\nAs previously discussed, in 2017, we completed two full-bank acquisitions - Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank. Also in 2017, we completed the acquisition of an insurance agency headquartered in Albemarle, North Carolina.\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these acquisitions.\nANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet interest income, the spread\u201d between earnings on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, constitutes the largest source of our earnings. Other factors that significantly affect operating results are the provision for loan losses, noninterest income such as service fees and noninterest expenses such as salaries, occupancy expense, equipment expense and other overhead costs, as well as the effects of income taxes.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income on a reported basis amounted to $216.2 million in 2019, $207.4 million in 2018, and $164.7 million in 2017. For internal purposes and in the discussion that follows, we evaluate our net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis by adding the tax benefit realized from tax-exempt loans and securities to reported interest income. Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis amounted to $217.8 million in 2019, $209.0 million in 2018, and $167.3 million in 2017. Management believes that analysis of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis is useful and appropriate because it allows a comparison of net interest amounts in different periods without taking into account the different mix of taxable versus non-taxable loans and investments that may have existed during those periods. The following is a reconciliation of reported net interest income to tax-equivalent net interest income. The tax-equivalent adjustment declined significantly from 2017 to 2018 as a result of the decrease in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>207,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax-equivalent adjustment\n</td> <td>1,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income, tax-equivalent\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>217,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 2 analyzes our net interest income. Our net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased by 4.2% in 2019 and increased by 24.9% in 2018. There are two primary factors that cause changes in the amount of net interest income we record - 1) changes in our loans and deposits balances and 2) our net interest margin. Net interest margin\u201d is a ratio we use to measure the spread between the yield on our earning assets and the cost of our funding and is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.\nThe increase in net interest income in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to growth in our interest-earning assets. For 2019, average interest-earning assets increased $336.0 million, or 6.6%, including growth of $184.5 million in average loans and $281.3 million in average securities. The growth in interest-earning assets was driven by funds provided from growth in deposits.\nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.09% in 2018 to 4.00% in 2019, which partially offset the positive impact on net interest income of the growth of our interest-earning assets just discussed. The lower net interest margin was a result of our funding costs increasing by more than our asset yields, largely as a result of competitive pressures. In 2019, asset yields increased by seven basis points, from 4.52% in 2018 to 4.59% in 2019, primarily as a result of Federal Reserve interest rate increases during the second half of 2018. Average funding costs increased by 18 basis points in 2019, from 0.48% in 2018 to 0.66% in 2019.\nThe increase in net interest income in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to growth in levels of earning assets, as the net interest margin did not change significantly, amounting to 4.09% in 2019 compared to 4.08% in 2018. Excluding the impact of the tax-equivalent adjustment, our net interest income to average earning asset ratio increased from 4.02% to 4.06% as a result of asset yields that increased slightly more than our funding cost. Average earning assets grew by $1.0 billion in 2018, or 24.6%, with average loans growing by $740.9 million, or 21.7%, while average deposits increased by $820.1 million, or 22.2%. Most of increases in average loans and deposits were due to the acquisitions of Asheville Savings Bank and Carolina Bank during 2017.\nThe net interest margin for all periods benefited, by varying amounts, from the net accretion income, primarily associated with purchase accounting premiums/discounts associated with acquisitions. As can be seen in the table below, we recorded $6.0 million in 2019, $7.1 million in 2018, and $7.1 million in 2017 in net accretion that increased net interest income.\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income - increased by accretion of loan discount on acquired loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income - increased by accretion of loan discount on retained SBA loans\n</td> <td>1,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - reduced by premium amortization of deposits\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - increased by discount accretion of borrowings\n</td> <td>(181\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(181\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(148\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact on net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe biggest component of the purchase accounting adjustments in each year was loan discount accretion on purchased loans, which amounted to $4.6 million in 2019, $6.1 million in 2018, and $6.6 million in 2017. Most of this loan discount accretion relates to our 2017 acquisitions of Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank, with the declines in accretion being due to the natural paydowns in those acquired loan portfolios, which is expected to continue. In addition to the loan discount accretion recorded on acquired loans, we recorded loan discount accretion of $1.4 million, $0.9 million, and $0.2 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, on the discounts associated with the retained unguaranteed portions of SBA loans sold in the secondary market. We entered that line of business in late 2016 and the higher discount accretion on those loans is associated with the growth in that business.\nAt December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, unaccreted loan discount on purchased loans amounted to $12.7 million, $17.3 million, and $24.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, unaccreted loan discount on SBA loans amounted to $7.1 million, $5.7 million, and $2.6 million, respectively.\nTable 3 presents additional detail regarding the estimated impact that changes in loan and deposit volumes and changes in the interest rates we earned/paid had on our net interest income in 2018 and 2019. For 2019, higher loan volume positively impacted interest income by $9.3 million, and higher loan interest rates positively impacted interest income by $2.9 million, with the combined effect driving the increase in total interest income of $18.9 million. Higher volumes and higher rates paid on deposits drove an increase of $10.6 million in interest expense. Lower borrowings expense in 2019, which was driven by lower levels of borrowings, partially offset the increase in total interest expense by $0.4 million. Overall, as Table 3 indicates, net interest income grew $8.8 million in 2019, with higher volumes comprising $14.2 million of the increase, which was partially offset by a $5.5 million negative impact associated with changes in interest rates. As previously discussed, in 2019 our average funding costs increased by more than our average asset yields from 2018.\nFor 2018, Table 3 is significantly impacted by our 2017 acquisitions of Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank, which were fully reflected in our average balances in 2018 compared to only a portion of the year in 2017. For 2018, the higher amounts of loans and deposits outstanding drove a net increase of $38.1 million in net interest income, while the impact of changes in interest rates resulted in a $4.6 million increase in net interest income.\nIf our nonaccrual and restructured loans as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period (or since origination if held for part of the period), gross interest income in the amounts of approximately $1,763,000, $1,616,000, and $1,503,000 for nonaccrual loans and $662,000, $974,000, and $1,182,000, for restructured loans would have been recorded for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Interest income on such loans that was actually collected and included in net income in 2019, 2018 and 2017 amounted to approximately $759,000, $765,000, and $415,000 for nonaccrual loans (prior to their being placed on nonaccrual status), and $528,000, $763,000, and $885,000 for restructured loans, respectively. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose loans were nonperforming.\nSee additional information regarding net interest income in the section entitled Interest Rate Risk.\u201d\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Management's determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on our level of loan growth, an evaluation of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, historical loan loss experience and other risk factors.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $2.3 million, a negative provision for loan losses of $3.6 million, and a provision for loan losses of $0.7 million, respectively. In 2019, our provision for loan losses was higher than previous years primarily due to higher net charge-offs. The negative provision for 2018 was due primarily to several large loan recoveries realized in the first quarter of 2018 totaling $3.7 million. Although our provision for loan losses was higher in 2019, it continues a trend in recent years of being low compared to historical levels. The low levels of provision for loan losses recorded in recent years were primarily the result of a sustained period of stable and generally improving loan quality trends, which resulted in lower amounts of provision needed to adjust our allowance for loan losses to the appropriate amount. This is driven by our allowance for loan loss model, which utilizes the net charge-offs experienced in the most recent years as a significant component of estimating the current allowance for loan losses that is necessary. Thus, older years (and parts thereof) systematically age out and are excluded from the analysis as time goes on. For the last three years, the new periods being added into our model had generally lower levels of net charge-offs than the older periods rolling out of the model, and thus mostly offset provisions for loan losses that would normally be required to reflect new loan growth and the net charge-offs experienced. Thus, the low level of net charge-offs (or net recoveries) experienced in recent years has been the primary reason for the low (or negative) provisions for loan losses recorded.\nAs shown in Table 14, total net charge-offs (recoveries) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, were $1.9 million, ($1.3 million), and $1.2 million, respectively. The higher net charge-offs in 2019 resulted from lower loan recoveries in comparison to 2018 and 2017.\nIn 2018, we completed a loan sale of approximately $5.2 million in smaller balance nonperforming loans that resulted in loan charge-offs of $2.2 million. However, this was more than offset by full payoffs on four loans received in the first quarter of 2018 that resulted in recoveries to the allowance for loan losses of $3.3 million\nSee Nonperforming Assets\u201d below for further discussion of our asset quality, which impacts our provisions for loan losses.\nThe allowance is monitored and analyzed regularly in conjunction with our loan analysis and grading program, and adjustments are made to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. See the section entitled Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience\u201d below for a more detailed discussion of the allowance for loan losses, including discussion of a change in the way that we will reserve for credit losses beginning in 2020 that may increase the levels and volatility of our provision for loan losses\nNoninterest Income\nOur noninterest income amounted to $59.5 million in 2019, $58.9 million in 2018, and $49.2 million in 2017.\nSee Table 4 and the following discussion for an understanding of the components of noninterest income.\nManagement evaluates noninterest income on a non-GAAP basis that excludes items such as securities gains and losses and other miscellaneous gains and losses. We refer to this as \"adjusted noninterest income.\" Adjusted noninterest income amounted to $59.6 million in 2019, a 2.4% increase from the $58.2 million recorded in 2018. The 2018 adjusted noninterest income of $58.2 million was an 18.6% increase from the $49.1 million recorded in 2017. Comparisons to 2017 for several line items are significantly impacted by our 2017 acquisitions, which resulted in the noninterest income generated by those entities only impacting 2017 for a partial year compared to the full year impact in 2018 and 2019.\nService charges on deposit accounts amounted to $13.0 million, $12.7 million, and $11.9 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We believe the increase in 2019 is primarily due to growth in our number of checking accounts, which we have promoted with new product offerings. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to the aforementioned acquisitions.\nOther service charges, commissions and fees amounted to $19.5 million in 2019, an 18.2% increase from the $16.5 million in 2018. The 2018 amount of $16.5 million was 14.5% higher than the $14.4 million earned in 2017. This category of noninterest income includes items such as interchange fees, ATM charges, safety deposit box rentals, fees from sales of personalized checks, and check cashing fees. The increase in this line item in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to growth in interchange fees that we earn when our customers use their debit and credit cards issued by our bank. Net interchange fees amounted to $13.8 million in 2019 compared to $12.0 million in 2018, an increase of 15.2%. We believe the growth in card usage by our customers is due to customer payment preferences, as well as a result of ongoing promotion of these products. General growth of our bank also contributed to the increase in this line item in 2019. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to the aforementioned acquisitions.\nFees from presold mortgages amounted to $3.9 million in 2019, $2.7 million in 2018, and $5.7 million in 2017. The increase in 2019 was due to increased volumes in the mortgage industry due to declining interest rates, as well as the hiring of additional loan originators. The decline from 2017 to 2018 was due to: i) overall lower volumes in the mortgage industry as a result of higher interest rates, ii) our Mortgage Loan Division originating a higher percentage of loans with construction components that are held in our loan portfolio and not sold, and iii) mortgage origination employees who left the Company in 2018.\nCommissions from sales of insurance and financial products amounted to $8.5 million in 2019, $8.7 million in 2018, and $5.3 million in 2017. This line item includes commissions we receive from two primary sources - 1) commissions from the sales of investment, annuity, and long term care insurance products, and 2) commissions from the sale of property and casualty insurance. The following table presents the contribution of each source to the total amount recognized in this line item:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions earned from:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales of investments, annuities, and long term care insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales of property and casualty insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs can be seen in the above table, sales of property and casualty insurance increased significantly in 2018, which was due to our September 1, 2017 acquisition of Bear Insurance Services (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information). The decline in in this line item in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to lower contingent commissions, which can vary significantly and are impacted by the claims experience of the insurance carriers used by the Company. Sales of investments, annuities and long term care insurance increased in 2018 and 2019 due to the increased growth and promotion of this line of business.\nWe began offering SBA consulting services in 2016 with our May 2016 acquisition of SBA Complete. In this line of business, SBA Complete assists community banks throughout the nation with SBA origination and servicing activities. SBA consulting fees amounted to $3.9 million in 2019, $4.7 million in 2018 and $4.0 million in 2017. The variances among the years are associated with changes in the origination activity of our client banks.\nShortly after the acquisition of SBA Complete, we began a SBA Lending Division, which originates SBA loans throughout the nation and sells the SBA guaranteed portion of those loans, which results in loan sale gains. Loan sale volume can be volatile based on origination activity and the timing of the funding of loans in the pipeline. This division generated $5.5 million in SBA loan sale gains in 2017. In 2018, this division added originators and generated $10.4 million in gains from sales. In 2019, loan sale gains of $8.3 million were realized, with the decline from 2018 being due to the natural volatility discussed above, as well as lower loan sale premiums commanded by the buyers of these loans for much of the year.\nTable 4 shows earnings from bank-owned life insurance income were $2.6 million in 2019, $2.5 million in 2018, and $2.3 million in 2017, with the increases being driven by growth in the underlying life insurance asset.\nSecurities gains of losses were not significant in the years presented, with 2019 having a net gain of $0.1 million, 2018 having no gains or losses, and 2017 having a net loss of $0.2 million.\nOther gains (losses), net\u201d amounted to a net loss of $0.2 million for 2019, a net gain of $0.7 million in 2018, and a net gain of $0.4 million in 2017. This line item represents the net effects of miscellaneous gains and losses that are non-routine in nature. The net gain of $0.7 million in 2018 primarily related to a gain on the sale of a previously closed branch building.\nNoninterest Expenses\nTotal noninterest expenses totaled $157.2 million, $156.5 million, $145.5 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Table 5 presents the components of our noninterest expense during the past three years. Comparisons to 2017 are impacted by our 2017 acquisitions, which resulted in the noninterest expense of those entities only impacting 2017 for a partial year compared to the full year impact in 2018 and 2019.\nTotal personnel expense increased from $92.0 million in 2018 to $96.0 million in 2019, an increase of $4.0 million, or 4.4%. Within personnel expense, salaries expense increased $4.0 million, or 5.4%, while employee benefits expense was approximately the same in 2018 and 2019 at approximately $16.9 million. Salaries expense increased primarily due to normal wage increases for our employees, as well as the hiring of several experienced bankers. Within employee benefits, health care expense, for which the Company is self-insured, is the single largest item and was unchanged in 2019 compared to 2018.\nIn 2018, total personnel expense increased from $82.1 million in 2017 to $92.0 million in 2018, an increase of $9.9 million, or 12.0%. The primary reason for these increase was the aforementioned acquisitions which impacted 2108 for a full year compared to a partial year in 2017. Also, approximately $1.3 million of the increase in personnel expense in 2018 can be attributed to increases in salaries expense related to our SBA lending activities. Also impacting personnel expense in 2018 was an increase in the 401(k) match offered by the Company to employees that was effective January 1, 2018, which increased from a 100% match up to 4% of an employee's salary contribution to a 100% match up to 6% of an employee's salary contribution.\nNet occupancy expenses amounted to $11.1 million in 2019, $10.8 million in 2018, and $9.7 million in 2017. The increase in 2019 is primarily related to increased rent expense associated with several new leases executed during the year. The increases in 2018 were related to the aforementioned acquisitions and expansion initiatives.\nEquipment related expenses amounted to $5.0 million, $5.6 million, and $4.5 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. In 2018, we accelerated $0.3 million in depreciation expense associated with our ATM fleet in anticipation of replacing our ATM's in early 2019. This resulted in a decline in ATM depreciation expense in 2019, as well as lower associated repairs and maintenance costs. In 2018, the increase in this line item related to the aforementioned acquisitions and expansion initiatives.\nMerger and acquisition expenses amounted to $0.2 million in 2019, $2.4 million in 2018, and $8.1 million in 2017. The 2018 amount was primarily comprised of severance costs and data processing conversion expenses related to the acquisition of Asheville Savings Bank. The 2017 amount was primarily comprised of professional fees and severance costs incurred in our acquisitions of Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank.\nIntangible amortization expense amounted to $4.9 million, $5.9 million and $4.0 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase from 2017 to 2018 was due to the addition of $22.5 million in amortizable intangible assets recorded in connection with the 2017 acquisitions of Carolina Bank, Asheville Savings Bank, and Bear Insurance Services. In 2019, intangible amortization expense declined to $4.9 million due to the amortization schedules of those intangible assets generally declining over time.\nFDIC insurance expense amounted to $0.3 million in 2019, $2.3 million in 2018, and $2.4 million in 2017. As discussed previously in the section FDIC Insurance\u201d, in 2019, we received an assessment credit of $1.3 million that was used to offset FDIC insurance expense in the last three quarters of 2019.\nOutside consultant expenses amounted to $1.5 million in 2019, $1.8 million in 2018, $2.5 million in 2017, with 2017 being impacted by consulting expense associated with various operational activities and enhancements.\nData processing expenses did not vary significantly among the periods presented, amounting to $3.1 million $3.2 million, $2.9 million, in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nMarketing expense amounted to $2.7 million in 2019, $3.1 million in 2018, and $2.5 million in 2017. In 2018, we initiated special promotional efforts in our new and expanded market areas.\nNon-credit losses remained relatively unchanged for the periods presented, amounting to $1.0 million in 2019, $1.0 million in 2018, and $0.9 million in 2017. These losses primarily related to debit card and credit card fraud losses.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 6 presents the components of income tax expense and the related effective tax rates. We recorded income tax expense of $24.2 million in 2019, $24.2 million in 2018, and $21.8 million in 2017. Our effective tax rates were 20.8% for 2019, 21.3% for 2018, and 32.1% for 2017. The lower effective rates in 2019 and 2018 compared to 2017 were the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017, which reduced the federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%. At December 31, 2017, we revalued our net deferred tax liability, which reduced income tax expense by $1.3 million for 2017, while in 2018, the new income tax rate of 21% reduced our effective tax rate from 2017.\nAlso, our effective tax rate has been impacted in recent years due lower statutory income tax rates in North Carolina. North Carolina reduced the state income tax rate for corporations from 4.0% in 2017 to 3.0% in 2018 and to 2.5% in 2019, which is where it remains for 2020. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 21.0% in 2020.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recorded stock-based compensation expense of $2.3 million, $1.6 million, and $1.1 million, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increases in this expense have been due to retention-based restricted stock grants made to certain officers during the years presented.

The following table presents detailed information regarding the nature of changes in our loans and deposits in 2018 and 2019. There were no acquisitions impacting year over year growth for either year.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance at\nbeginning of\nperiod\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Internal\ngrowth,\nnet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance at\nend of\nperiod\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\npercentage\ngrowth\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,249,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,453,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits -

Loan growth for the periods was organic and primarily driven by our expansion in high-growth markets, hiring of experienced bankers, and increases in SBA lending. We expect continued growth in our loan portfolio for 2020.\nDuring 2019, we experienced an increase in total deposits of $272.0 million, or 5.8%. Within total deposits, we grew our retail deposits (non-brokered deposits) by $426 million, or 9.6%. Within our retail deposits, we experienced growth of $321.9 million, or 8.7%, in checking, money market and savings accounts, and had growth of $106.6 million, or 15.0%, in our retail time deposits. We routinely engage in activities designed to grow and retain deposits, such as (1) emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with us, (2) pricing deposits at rate levels that will attract and/or retain deposits, and (3) continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or\nenhance our appeal as a primary provider of financial services. The high retail deposit growth in 2019 allowed us to reduce our level of brokered deposits by $154 million, or 64.1% during the year. Additionally, we were able to pay down our borrowings in 2019 by $106 million.\nDuring 2018, we experienced an increase in total deposits of $252.4 million, or 5.7%, which was substantially all retail deposit growth. Within our retail deposits, we experienced growth of $186.3 million, or 5.3%, in checking, money market and savings accounts, and had growth of $70.4 million, or 11.0%, in our retail time deposits.\nOur overall liquidity did not vary significantly at December 31, 2019 compared to a year earlier. Our liquid assets (cash and securities) as a percentage of our total deposits and borrowings was 21.4% at December 31, 2019 compared to 21.0% at December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2019, our nonperforming assets to total assets ratio was 0.62% compared to 0.74% at December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to on-going resolution of nonperforming assets and improving credit quality.\nDistribution of Assets and Liabilities\nTable 7 sets forth the percentage relationships of significant components of our balance sheet at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nOur balance sheet mix has remained relatively stable over the past three years. On the asset side, net loans have consistently comprised 72% to 73% of total assets and interest-earning assets have ranged from 88%-90%. In both 2018 and 2019, we used excess cash balances to purchase available for sale securities, which resulted in our mix of securities available for sale increasing from 6% of total assets at year end 2017 to 9% of total assets at the end of 2018 and to 13% of total assets at the end of 2019.\nOn the liability side, deposits have consistently comprised 79% to 80% of total liabilities and shareholders' equity. In 2019, we paid down our borrowings by $106 million, which resulted in our borrowings decreasing to 5% of total liabilities and shareholders' equity from 7% at the two prior year ends.\nShareholders' equity increased from 12% of total liabilities and shareholders' equity at December 31, 2017 to 14% at December 31, 2019 due to increases in retained earnings due to high levels of net income recorded.\nSecurities\nInformation regarding our securities portfolio as of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 is presented in Tables 8 and 9.\nThe composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income. The investment portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds, furnishing liquidity, and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits. We obtain fair values for our investment securities from a third-party investment recordkeeper, who specializes in securities purchases and sales, recordkeeping, and valuation. This recordkeeper provides us with a third-party report that contains an evaluation of internal controls that includes testwork of securities valuation. We further test the values we receive by comparing the values for a significant sample of securities to another third-party valuation service on a quarterly basis.\nTotal securities amounted to $889.9 million, $602.6 million, and $461.8 million at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increase in securities in 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to purchases of fixed rate securities that we initiated to realize higher yields and to protect the Company from expectations of falling interest rates. To fund the purchases, we primarily used interest-bearing cash balances, which earn interest tied to the federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve.\nThe majority of our government-sponsored enterprise\u201d securities carry one maturity date, often with an issuer call feature. At December 31, 2019, of the $20.0 million in available for sale government-sponsored enterprise securities, $15.0 million were issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank system and the remaining $5 million were issued by the Federal Farm Credit Bank system.\nNearly all of our $767.3 million in available for sale mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2019 were issued by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, or the SBA, each of which is a government agency or government-sponsored corporation and guarantees the repayment of the securities. Included in this total are commercial mortgage-backed securities of $262.3 million. Mortgage-backed securities vary in their repayment in correlation with the underlying pools of mortgage loans.\nOur investment policy permits us to hold up to 15% of our securities portfolio in corporate bonds. These bonds have the most credit risk of any of our securities. At December 31, 2019, our $34.7 million investment in corporate bonds was comprised of the following:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Issuer\nRatings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank of America\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A2\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>1/11/2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Citigroup\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa2\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>Various\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goldman Sachs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>1/22/2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>JP Morgan Chase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A2\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>1/25/2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Institutions, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>4/15/2030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wells Fargo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>2/13/2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eagle Bancorp, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>9/1/2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Citizens Bancorp (North Carolina) Trust Preferred Security\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Not Rated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/15/2034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>915\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment in corporate bonds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________________________________\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Ratings issued by Moody's\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Rating issued by Kroll Bond Rating Agency.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We have concluded that any unrealized losses associated with our corporate bonds are due to interest rate considerations and not due to credit concerns.\nAt December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, net unrealized gains (losses) of $9.7 million, ($12.4 million), and ($2.2 million), respectively, were included in the carrying value of securities classified as available for sale. Management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates and the overall economic environment, not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations. Net unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable deferred income taxes, are included as part of a separate component of shareholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income) as of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2019, we held $67.9 million in securities classified as held to maturity, which are carried at amortized cost. These securities had fair values that exceeded their carrying values by $0.4 million December 31, 2019. Approximately $41.4 million of the securities held to maturity are mortgage-backed securities that have been issued by either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. The remaining $26.5 million in securities held to maturity are comprised almost entirely of municipal bonds issued by state and local governments throughout our market area. We have no significant concentration of bond holdings from one government entity, with the single largest exposure to any one entity being $4.5 million. Management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates, not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations.\nThe weighted average taxable-equivalent yield for the securities available for sale portfolio was 2.70% at December 31, 2019. The expected weighted average life of the available for sale portfolio using the call date for above-market callable bonds, the maturity date for all other non-mortgage-backed securities, and the expected life for mortgage-backed securities, was 4.7 years.\nThe weighted average taxable-equivalent yield for the securities held to maturity portfolio was 2.84% at December 31, 2019. The expected weighted average life of the held to maturity portfolio using the call date for above-market callable bonds, the expected life for mortgage-backed securities, and the maturity date for all other securities, was 2.3 years.\nWe expect the adoption of CECL to result in an insignificant amount of credit losses related to our securities portfolio.\nThe following table provides the names of issuers for which the Company has investment securities totaling in excess of 10% of shareholders' equity and the fair value and amortized cost of these investments as of December 31, 2019. All of these securities are issued by government sponsored corporations.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuer\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nShareholders'\nEquity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>438,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>443,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ginnie Mae\n</td> <td>172,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>174,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freddie Mac\n</td> <td>162,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>772,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>781,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoans\nThe loan portfolio is the largest category of our earning assets and is comprised of commercial loans, real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, and consumer loans. The majority of our loan portfolio is within our 36 county market area, which are located in western, central and eastern North Carolina and three counties in northeastern South Carolina. We also have a portfolio of SBA loans that have been made on a nationwide basis. The diversity of the economic bases of our market areas has historically provided a stable lending environment.\nIn 2019, loans outstanding increased $204.4 million, or 4.8%, whereas in 2018, loans outstanding increased $206.7 million, or 5.1%. The growth in 2019 and 2018 was generated internally and was concentrated primarily within our higher growth markets. Also, our SBA Lending Division contributed $14 million of the growth in 2019 and $72 million in 2018.\nThe majority of our loan portfolio over the years has been real estate mortgage loans, with loans secured by real estate consistently comprising 88% to 90% of our outstanding loan balances. Except for construction, land development and other land loans, the majority of our real estate\u201d loans are personal and commercial loans where cash flow from the borrower's occupation or business is the primary repayment source, with the real estate pledged providing a secondary repayment source.\nTable 10 provides a summary of the loan portfolio composition of our total loans at each of the past five year ends.\nCommercial, financial, and agricultural loans have increased from 8% at December 31, 2015 to 11% at December 31, 2019, due primarily to growth in loans made to municipalities and loans originated by our SBA Lending Division.\nResidential real estate loans have declined from 31% of total loans at December 31, 2015 to 25% of total loans at December 31, 2019. This decline has been due to a combination of factors including consumers refinancing their home loans held by the Bank with long term fixed rate loans, which we typically sell in the secondary market. Additionally, the Carolina Bank loan portfolio assumed during 2017 had only an 11% mix of residential real estate loans.\nCommercial real estate loans as a percentage of total loans has increased steadily over the past five years and amounted to 43% of all loans at December 31, 2019. Consistent with our community banking strategy, we have placed emphases on this type of loan growth and hired a number of experienced community bankers, who have originated a significant amount of business loans secured by real estate. Also, growth in our SBA loan portfolio has contributed to the increase in this category.\nTable 11 provides a summary of scheduled loan maturities over certain time periods, with fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans shown separately. Approximately 12% of our accruing loans outstanding at December 31, 2019 mature within one year and 54% of total loans mature within five years, with both of those measures being consistent with recent years. As of December 31, 2019, the percentages of variable rate loans and fixed rate loans as compared to total performing loans were 33% and 67%, which is also consistent with recent years. Fixed rate loans continue to be popular with many borrowers in order to lock in a low interest rate during the historically low interest rate environment that has been in effect. While this presents risk to our Company if interest rates rise, we\nmeasure our interest rate risk closely and, as discussed in the section Interest Rate Risk\u201d below, we do not believe that an increase in interest rates would materially negatively impact our net interest income.\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings, loans past due 90 or more days and still accruing interest, and foreclosed properties. As a matter of policy we place all loans that are past due 90 or more days on nonaccrual basis, and thus there were no loans at any of the past five year ends that were 90 days past due and still accruing interest.\nNonaccrual loans are loans on which interest income is no longer being recognized or accrued because management has determined that the collection of interest is doubtful. Placing loans on nonaccrual status negatively impacts earnings because (i) interest accrued but unpaid as of the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed and deducted from interest income, (ii) future accruals of interest income are not recognized until it becomes probable that both principal and interest will be paid and (iii) principal charged-off, if appropriate, may necessitate additional provisions for loan losses that are charged against earnings. In some cases, where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties, loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the originally contracted terms.\nTable 12 summarizes our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated. Prior to September 2016, we presented nonperforming assets that were subject to the loss share agreements as covered\u201d and nonperforming assets that were not subject to the loss share agreements as non-covered.\u201d Our loss share agreements with the FDIC were terminated during 2016, and all assets became non-covered at that time.\nIn the past several years, we have benefited from improving economic conditions and successfully implemented a combination of strategies to reduce nonperforming assets. As a result, our nonperforming asset levels have declined steadily over the years, with nonperforming assets amounting to amounting to just 0.62% of total assets at December 31, 2019. This compares to ratios of 0.74% and 0.96% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In 2018, our nonperforming asset levels benefited from a loan sale of approximately $5.2 million in smaller balance nonperforming loans.\nTable 12a presents our nonperforming assets at December 31, 2019 by general geographic region.\nThe following is the composition, by loan type, of all of our nonaccrual loans at each period end:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>At December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial, financial, and agricultural\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>919\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - construction, land development, and other land loans\n</td> <td>1,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - mortgage - residential (1-4 family) first mortgages\n</td> <td>7,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - mortgage - home equity loans/lines of credit\n</td> <td>1,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - mortgage - commercial and other\n</td> <td>8,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Installment loans to individuals\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe nonaccrual table above generally indicates a net increase in nonaccrual loans during the year, with the Commercial, financial and agricultural\u201d and \"Real estate - mortgage - commercial and other\" categories experiencing the largest increases. Both of the increases were primarily driven by SBA loans that were placed on nonaccrual status during 2019.\nManagement routinely monitors the status of certain large loans that, in management's opinion, have credit weaknesses that could cause them to become nonperforming loans. In addition to the nonperforming loan amounts discussed above, management believes that an estimated $3 to $7 million of loans that were performing in accordance with their contractual terms at December 31, 2019 have the potential to develop problems in the near term depending upon the particular financial situations of the borrowers and economic conditions in general. Management has taken these potential problem loans into consideration when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 (see discussion below).\nLoans classified for regulatory purposes as loss, doubtful, substandard, or special mention that have not been disclosed in the problem loan amounts and the potential problem loan amounts discussed above do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties that management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results, liquidity, or capital resources, or represent material credits about which management is aware of any information that causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms.\nWe provide additional information regarding the credit quality classification status of our loans in tables contained in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Those tables indicate that at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, our level of classified and nonaccrual loans amounted to approximately 1.4% of total loans at each year end.\nForeclosed properties includes primarily foreclosed real estate. Total foreclosed real estate amounted to $3.9 million, $7.4 million, and $12.6 million at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Generally, we have experienced decreases in foreclosed real estate over the past several years primarily due to increased property sales activity and the improvement in our overall asset quality.\nThe following table presents the detail of our foreclosed real estate at each of the past two year ends:\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in thousands\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vacant land and farmland\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1-4 family residential properties\n</td> <td>974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>1,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total foreclosed real estate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAllowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience\nThe allowance for loan losses is created by direct charges to operations (known as a provision for loan losses\u201d for the period in which the charge is taken). Losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which such loans, in management's opinion, become uncollectible. Recoveries realized during the period are credited to this allowance. We consider our procedures for recording the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy. See the heading Critical Accounting Policies\u201d above for further discussion.\nThe factors that influence management's judgment in determining the amount charged to operating expense include recent loan loss experience, composition of the loan portfolio, evaluation of probable inherent losses and current economic conditions.\nWe use a loan analysis and grading program to facilitate our evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. In this program, credit risk grades are assigned by management and tested by an internal loan review department and also an independent third-party consulting firm. The testing program includes an evaluation of a sample of new loans, loans we identify as having potential credit weaknesses, loans past due 90 days or more, loans originated by new loan officers, nonaccrual loans and any other loans identified during previous regulatory and other examinations.\nWe strive to maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with what management believes are conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of our market areas. Every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies. We have no foreign loans, few agricultural loans and do not engage in significant lease financing or highly leveraged transactions. Commercial loans are diversified among a variety of industries. The majority of loans captioned in the tables discussed below as real estate\u201d loans are personal and commercial loans where real estate provides additional security for the loan. Collateral for the majority of these loans is located within our principal market area.\nThe total allowance for loan losses amounted to $21.4 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $21.0 million at December 31, 2018 and $23.3 million at December 31, 2017.\nOur allowance for loan losses is primarily based on mathematical model with the primary factors impacting this model being loan growth, net charge-off history, and asset quality trends, as well as specific reserves we set aside\non certain individual loans exhibiting signs of deterioration. Our allowance for loan loss model utilizes the net charge-offs experienced in the most recent years as a significant component of estimating the current allowance for loan losses that is necessary. Thus, older years (and parts thereof) systematically age out and are excluded from the analysis as time goes on. In recent years, the new periods have had generally lower levels of net charge-offs (and net recoveries in some periods) than the older periods rolling out of the model, and thus mostly offset upward adjustments to the allowance that would normally be required to reflect new loan growth and the net charge-offs experienced. Thus, the low level of net charge-offs (or net recoveries) experienced in recent years has been the primary reason for the low (or negative) provisions for loan losses that have been necessary to appropriately adjust the level or our allowance for loan losses.\nNet loan charge-offs (recoveries) of total loans amounted to $1.9 million in 2019, ($1.3 million) in 2018, and $1.2 million in 2017. The trend of lower net charge-offs is associated with lower levels of nonperforming loans and credit improvements in our underlying loan portfolio. In 2019, the increases in the categories of \"Commercial, financial, and agricultural\" and \"Real estate - mortgage - commercial and other\" were driven by charge-offs within our SBA loan portfolio. In 2018, we received full payoffs on four loans that had been previously charged-down by approximately $3.3 million and are included in the table as recoveries, contributing significantly to the net recovery position for the year.\nThe ratio of our allowance to total loans was 0.48%, 0.50%, and 0.58% at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The decline in this ratio from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2019 was a result of the factors discussed above that impacted our low levels of provision for loan losses. Our relatively low level of allowance to total loans is also significantly impacted by the acquisitions of Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank, which had over $1 billion in total loans. Applicable accounting guidance did not allow us to record an allowance for loan losses upon the acquisition of loans - instead the acquired loans were recorded at their discounted fair value, which included the consideration of any expected losses. No allowance for loan losses is recorded for the acquired loans unless the expected credit losses exceed the remaining unamortized discounts - based on an individual basis for purchased credit impaired loans and on a pooled basis for performing acquired loans. See Critical Accounting Policies above for further discussion. Unaccreted discount on acquired loans, which is available to absorb loan losses on those acquired loans, amounted to $12.7 million, $17.3 million, and $24.3 million at December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nTable 13 sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated. However, the allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses in all categories.\nManagement considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover probable loan losses on the loans outstanding as of each reporting date. It must be emphasized, however, that the determination of the allowance using our procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about economic conditions and other factors affecting loans. No assurance can be given that we will not in any particular period sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of conditions and factors then prevailing, will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings.\nIn addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and losses on foreclosed real estate. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners' judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations.\nFor the years indicated, Table 14 summarizes our balances of loans outstanding, average loans outstanding, and a detailed rollforward of the allowance for loan losses.\nThe way that we reserve for loan losses will experience a significant change in 2020, as a result of new guidance issued by the FASB. The guidance requires an entity to utilize a new impairment model known as the current expected credit loss (\"CECL\") model to estimate its lifetime \"expected credit losses\" and record an allowance that, when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial assets. The CECL framework is expected to result in earlier recognition of credit losses and is expected to be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of the Company's loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts. The Company will initially apply the impact of the new guidance through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption, which, for the Company, is January 1, 2020. At this time, the Company expects its allowance for credit\nlosses will increase to approximately $40-$44 million upon adoption compared to its allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 of approximately $21 million.\nThe CECL standard provides significant flexibility and requires a high degree of judgment with regards to pooling financial assets with similar risk characteristics and adjusting the relevant historical loss information in order to develop an estimate of expected lifetime losses. Providing for losses over the life of our loan portfolio is a change to the previous method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable and incurred. This change may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses rapidly in future periods, and greatly increases the types of data we need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. It may also result in even small changes to future forecasts having a significant impact on the allowance, which could make the allowance more volatile, and regulators may impose additional capital buffers to absorb this volatility.\nDeposits\nDeposits are a critical part of our business, as they provide the primary funding source for our loans and investments. Accordingly, as discussed below, we have implemented various strategies and developed competitive products to promote growth of our deposit balances.\nAt December 31, 2019, deposits outstanding amounted to $4.93 billion, an increase of 5.8%, or $272.0 million, from the $4.66 billion at December 31, 2018, all of which was organic growth. Within total deposits, we grew our retail deposits (non-brokered deposits) in 2019 by $426 million, or 9.6%. Within our retail deposits, we experienced growth of $321.9 million, or 8.7%, in checking, money market and savings accounts, and had growth of $106.6 million, or 15.0%, in our retail time deposits. As a result of the strong retail deposit growth in 2019, we were able to reduce our level of brokered deposits during the year by $153.7 million, a decrease of 64.1%.\nDuring 2018, we experienced an increase in total deposits of $252.4 million, or 5.7%, which was substantially all retail deposit growth. Within our retail deposits, we experienced growth of $186.3 million, or 5.3%, in checking, money market and savings accounts, and had growth of $70.4 million, or 11.0%, in our retail time deposits.\nWe routinely engage in activities designed to grow and retain deposits, such as (1) emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with us, (2) pricing deposits at rate levels that will attract and/or retain deposits, and (3) continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our appeal as a primary provider of financial services.\nThe nature of our deposit growth is illustrated in the table on page 40. The following table reflects the mix of our deposits at each of the past three year ends:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest-bearing checking accounts\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing checking accounts\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money market deposits\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings deposits\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits - Brokered\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits > $100,000 - retail\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits < $100,000 - retail\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deposits\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur deposit mix remains heavily concentrated in transaction and non-time deposit accounts, with time deposits comprising 21% or less of total deposits at each year end. This is beneficial for us, as these accounts generally carry lower interest rates compared to time deposits. Prior to the very low interest rate environment that we have been in for the past decade, the time deposit concentration was closer to 50%. We believe the lower mix of time deposits has been due to the relatively small gap between the interest rates that we pay on transaction accounts versus the rates we pay on time deposits.\nTable 15 presents the average amounts of our deposits and the average yield paid for those deposits for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we held approximately $649.9 million in time deposits of $100,000 or more. Table 16 is a maturity schedule of time deposits of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2019. This table shows that 87% of our time deposits greater than $100,000 mature within one year.\nAt each of the past three year ends, we have no deposits issued through foreign offices, nor do we believe that we held any deposits by foreign depositors.\nBorrowings\nWe typically utilize borrowings to provide balance sheet liquidity and to fund imbalances in our loan growth compared to our deposit growth. Our borrowings outstanding totaled $300.7 million at December 31, 2019, $406.6 million at December 31, 2018, and $407.5 million at December 31, 2017. Table 2 shows that average borrowings were $332.6 million in 2019, $406.9 million in 2018, and $325.9 million in 2017.\nComparing year end 2018 to year end 2017, borrowings remained essentially unchanged as deposit growth fully funded our loan growth for the year. In 2019, we used a portion of excess cash generated from deposit growth that has exceed loan growth in recent years to pay down $106 million in borrowings.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had three sources of readily available borrowing capacity - 1) an approximately $1.05 billion line of credit with the FHLB, of which $247 million and $353 million was outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, 2) a $35 million federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2019 or 2018, and 3) an approximately $129 million line of credit through the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's ( FRB\u201d) discount window, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nIn addition to any outstanding borrowings from the FHLB that reduce the available borrowing capacity of the line of credit, our borrowing capacity was further reduced by $190 million at both December 31, 2019 and 2018, as a result of our pledging letters of credit backed by the FHLB for public deposits at each of those dates. Thus, our unused available line of credit with the FHLB amounted to approximately $610 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $502 million a year earlier.\nOur line of credit with the FHLB can be structured as either short-term or long-term borrowings, depending on the particular funding or liquidity need, and is secured by our FHLB stock and a blanket lien on most of our real estate loan portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the average amount of FHLB borrowings outstanding was approximately $278.4 million with a weighted average interest rate for the year of 2.22%. The maximum amount of short-term FHLB borrowings outstanding at any month-end during 2019 was $352.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the average amount of FHLB borrowings outstanding was approximately $353.2 million with a weighted average interest rate for the year of 1.91%. The maximum amount of short-term FHLB borrowings outstanding at any month-end during 2018 was $353.5 million.\nOur correspondent bank relationship allows us to purchase up to $35 million in federal funds on an overnight, unsecured basis (federal funds purchased). We had no borrowings under this line at December 31, 2019 or 2018. There were no federal funds purchased outstanding at any month-end during 2019 or 2018.\nWe also have a line of credit with the FRB discount window. This line is secured by a blanket lien on a portion of our commercial and consumer loan portfolio (excluding real estate loans). Based on the collateral that we owned as of December 31, 2019, the available line of credit was approximately $129 million. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding under this line.\nIn addition to the lines of credit described above, we also have of $56.7 million of trust preferred security debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Each of our three issuances have 30 year final maturities and were structured in a manner that allows them to qualify as Tier 1 capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements. We may call these debt securities at par on any quarterly interest payment, but do not expect to do so. The interest rate on these debt securities adjusts on a quarterly basis at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.70% for $20.6 million, three-month LIBOR plus 1.39% on $25.8 million, and LIBOR + 2.00% for $10.3 million that was assumed in the Carolina Bank acquisition.\nLiquidity, Commitments, and Contingencies\nOur liquidity is determined by our ability to convert assets to cash or to acquire alternative sources of funds to meet the needs of our customers who are withdrawing or borrowing funds, and our ability to maintain required reserve\nlevels, pay expenses and operate the Company on an ongoing basis. Our primary liquidity sources are net income from operations, cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and other short-term investments. Our securities portfolio is comprised almost entirely of readily marketable securities which could also be sold to provide cash.\nAs noted above, in addition to internally generated liquidity sources, at December 31, 2019, we had the ability to obtain borrowings from the following three sources - 1) an approximately $1.05 billion line of credit with the FHLB, 2) a $35 million federal funds line with a correspondent bank, and 3) an approximately $129 million line of credit through the FRB's discount window.\nOur overall liquidity remained relatively unchanged at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. Our liquid assets (cash and securities) as a percentage of our total deposits and borrowings amounted to 21.4% at December 31, 2019 compared to 21.0% at December 31, 2018.\nWe continue to believe our liquidity sources, including unused lines of credit, are at an acceptable level and remain adequate to meet our operating needs in the foreseeable future. We will continue to monitor our liquidity position carefully and will explore and implement strategies to increase liquidity if deemed appropriate.\nIn the normal course of business we have various outstanding contractual obligations that will require future cash outflows. In addition, there are commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit, that may or may not require future cash outflows.\nTable 18 reflects our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2019. Any of our $247 million in outstanding borrowings with the FHLB may be accelerated immediately by the FHLB in certain circumstances, including material adverse changes in our condition or if our qualifying collateral is less than the amount required under the terms of the borrowing agreement.\nIn the normal course of business there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities such as commitments to extend credit, which are not reflected in the financial statements. The following table presents a summary of our outstanding loan commitments as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Type of Commitment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fixed Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variable Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>387\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>936\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, we also had $12.0 million and $15.7 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit outstanding. We had no carrying amount for these standby letters of credit at either of those dates. The nature of the standby letters of credit is that of a stand-alone obligation made on behalf of our customers to suppliers of the customers to guarantee payments owed to the supplier by the customer. The standby letters of credit are generally for terms of one year, at which time they may be renewed for another year if both parties agree. The payment of the guarantees would generally be triggered by a continued nonpayment of an obligation owed by the customer to the supplier. The maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted) we could be required to make under the guarantees in the event of nonperformance by the parties to whom credit or financial guarantees have been extended is represented by the contractual amount of the financial instruments discussed above. In the event that we are required to honor a standby letter of credit, a note, already executed by the customer, becomes effective providing repayment terms and any collateral. Over the past two years, we have had to honor only a few standby letters of credit, none of which resulted in any loss to the Company. We expect any draws under existing commitments to be funded through normal operations.\nIt has been our experience that deposit withdrawals are generally able to be replaced with new deposits when needed. Based on that assumption, management believes that it can meet its contractual cash obligations and existing commitments from normal operations.\nWe are not involved in any legal proceedings that, in management's opinion, are likely to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.\nCapital Resources and Shareholders' Equity\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2019 amounted to $852.4 million compared to $764.2 million at December 31, and $693.0 million at December 31, 2017. The two basic components that typically have the largest impact on our shareholders' equity are net income, which increases shareholders' equity, and dividends declared, which decrease shareholders' equity. Additionally, any stock issuances can significantly increase shareholders' equity, including those associated with acquisitions, and any stock repurchases would reduce shareholders' equity.\nIn 2019, the most significant factors that impacted our equity were 1) the $92.0 million net income reported for 2019, which increased equity, 2) common stock dividends declared of $16.0 million, which reduced equity, 3) other comprehensive income of $17.1 million (primarily driven by increases in unrealized gains on available securities for sale), which increased equity, 4) stock repurchases of $10.0 million, which decreased equity, and 5) the issuance of $3.1 million in stock related to the conclusion of an earn-out period related to a 2016 acquisition, which increased equity. See the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity within the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of other less significant items affecting shareholders' equity.\nIn 2018, the most significant factors that impacted our equity were 1) the $89.3 million net income reported for 2018, which increased equity, and 2) common stock dividends declared of $11.9 million, which reduced equity. See the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity within the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of other less significant items affecting shareholders' equity.\nIn 2017, the most significant factors that impacted our equity were 1) the issuances of $284.2 million of common stock in connection with two bank acquisitions, which increased equity, 2) the $46.0 million net income reported for 2017, which increased equity, and 3) common stock dividends declared of $8.3 million, which reduced equity.\nWith the acquisition of Carolina Bank in March 2017, we assumed a deferred compensation plan for certain members of Carolina Bank's board of directors that is fully funded by Company stock, which was valued at $7.7 million on the date of acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition in 2017, approximately $5.1 million of the deferred compensation has been paid to the plan participants. The balances of the related asset and liability were each $2.6 million at December 31, 2019, both of which are presented as components of shareholders' equity.\nAs discussed in Borrowings\u201d above, we also currently have $56.7 million in trust preferred securities outstanding, all of which qualify as Tier I capital under both current and forthcoming regulatory standards.\nWe are not aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities or otherwise which, if they were to be implemented, would have a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources, or operations.\nThe Company and the Bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the Commissioner. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nTable 21 presents our regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. All of our capital ratios have significantly exceeded the minimum regulatory thresholds for all periods covered by this report.\nIn this economic environment, our goal is to maintain our capital ratios at levels at least 200 basis points higher than the well capitalized\u201d thresholds set for banks. At December 31, 2019, our tier 1 leverage ratio was 11.19% compared to the regulatory well capitalized bank-level threshold of 5.00% and our total risk-based capital ratio was 14.89% compared to the 10.00% regulatory well capitalized threshold.\nIn addition to regulatory capital ratios, we also closely monitor our ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets ( TCE Ratio\u201d). Our TCE Ratio was 10.20% at December 31, 2019 compared to 9.07% at December 31, 2018.\nSee Supervision and Regulation\u201d under Business\u201d above and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of other matters that may affect our capital resources.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments\nOff-balance sheet arrangements include transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements pursuant to which we have obligations or provide guarantees on behalf of an unconsolidated entity. We have no off-balance\nsheet arrangements of this kind other than letters of credit and repayment guarantees associated with our trust preferred securities.\nDerivative financial instruments include futures, forwards, interest rate swaps, options contracts, and other financial instruments with similar characteristics. We have not engaged in significant derivatives activities through December 31, 2019 and have no current plans to do so.\nReturn on Assets and Equity\nTable 20 shows return on average assets (net income divided by average total assets), return on average common equity (net income divided by average common shareholders' equity), dividend payout ratio (dividends per share divided by net income per common share) and shareholders' equity to assets ratio (average total shareholders' equity divided by average total assets) for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest Rate Risk (Including Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk -", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to comprehend the table you have provided since it appears to be incomplete.\n- I am unable to proceed with the task unless I have complete information.\n- Could you please provide me with the missing information so that I can complete the table for you?\n- Once I have received the complete information, I will be able to proceed with the task and provide you with a completed table.\n\nCould you please provide me with the information that is missing from the table?", "item_7_tables": "Table 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Highlights\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands except per share data)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>207,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (reversal) for loan losses\n</td> <td>2,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,589\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest income\n</td> <td>59,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest expenses\n</td> <td>157,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>116,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>24,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>3.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balances At Year End\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,143,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,864,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans\n</td> <td>4,453,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,249,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits\n</td> <td>4,931,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,659,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratios\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average assets\n</td> <td>1.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average common equity\n</td> <td>11.32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest margin (taxable-equivalent)\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.09\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>n/m -

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding our results of operations and changes in financial position for the past three years. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page 70 of this report and the supplemental financial data contained in Tables 1 through 22 beginning on page 53 of this report. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. The following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nOverview - 2019 Compared to 2018\nWe reported net income per diluted common share of $3.10 in 2019, a 3.0% increase compared to 2018. Our outstanding loan balances increased by 4.8% and total deposits increased 5.8%.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded net income of $92.0 million, or $3.10 per diluted common share, an increase of 3% in earnings per share from the $89.3 million, or $3.01 per diluted common share, for 2018. The higher earnings in 2019 were primarily related to higher net interest income associated with our growth.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $216.2 million, a 4.2% increase from the $207.4 million recorded in 2018. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to growth in interest-earning assets. Also, see the section entitled Net Interest Income\u201d for additional information.\nOur net interest margin (tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets) was 4.00% for 2019 compared to 4.09% for 2018. The decrease in the net interest margin realized in 2019 was primarily due to a combination of lower loan discount accretion and lower asset yields.\nWe recorded a provision for loan losses of $2.3 million in 2019 compared to negative provision for loan losses of $3.6 million (reduction of the allowance for loan losses) in 2018. The negative provision for 2018 was due primarily to several large loan recoveries realized in the first quarter of 2018 totaling $3.7 million. Generally, our provisions for loan losses have been low over the past several years due to strong asset quality, including low loan charge-offs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, noninterest income amounted to $59.5 million compared to $58.9 million for 2018, an increase of 1.0%. Increases were experienced in i) service charges on deposit accounts due to strong deposit growth, ii) interchange income due to increased credit and debit card usage, and iii) in fees from presold mortgages due to higher mortgage origination activity. Those increases were substantially offset by lower SBA loan sale gains and lower SBA consulting fees. See the section entitled Noninterest Income\u201d for additional information.\nNoninterest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $157.2 million compared to $156.5 million in 2018, an increase of 0.5%. A 5.4% increase in salaries expense associated with wage increases and the growth of the Company was substantially offset by lower merger and acquisition expenses and lower intangibles amortization expense. See the section entitled Noninterest Expense\u201d for additional information.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2019 amounted to $6.1 billion, a 4.8% increase from a year earlier. Loan growth for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $204.4 million, or 4.8%, and deposit growth amounted to $272.0 million, or 5.8%. Within deposits, our retail deposits (excludes brokered deposits and internet time deposits) grew 9.7% during 2019, with 14.8% growth in noninterest-bearing checking accounts. As a result of the strong retail deposit growth, we reduced our level of brokered deposits by $153.7 million, or 64.1%, from $239.9 million at December 31, 2018 to $86.1 million at December 31, 2019. Internet time deposits decreased from $3.4 million at December 31, 2018 to $0.7 million at December 31, 2019. Additionally, we paid down borrowings by $106 million, or 26.0%, during 2019.\nDuring 2019, we repurchased 281,593 shares of the Company's common stock at an average price of $35.51, which totaled $10 million. As of December 31, 2019, we had $40 million of additional share repurchase authority, which has an expiration date of December 31, 2020.\nOverview - 2018 Compared to 2017\nWe reported net income per diluted common share of $3.01 in 2018, a 65.4% increase compared to the $1.82 per share earnings for 2017. In 2018, a full year of earnings and cost efficiencies realized from two significant 2017 acquisitions drove the increase in earnings. Our loan balances, total assets and deposits all grew 5%-6%.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded net income of $89.3 million, or $3.01 per diluted common share, an increase of 65.4% in earnings per share from the $46.0 million, or $1.82 per diluted common share, for 2017. The higher earnings in 2018 were primarily due to the acquisitions of Carolina Bank on March 3, 2017 and Asheville Savings Bank on October 1, 2017. The assets, liabilities and earnings for the acquisitions were recorded beginning on their respective acquisition dates. Therefore, the year 2018 included twelve months of earnings from the acquisition compared to only a partial year in 2017. Earnings and earnings per share for 2018 also benefited\nfrom operational efficiencies that were realized in the integration of the acquisitions that became fully realized in the final three quarters of 2018.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to $207.4 million, a 25.9% increase from the $164.7 million recorded in 2017. The increase in net interest income was due primarily to growth in interest-earning assets, which for the twelve month period was impacted by assets acquired in the Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank acquisitions. Our net interest margin (tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets) of 4.09% for 2018 did not vary significantly from the 4.08% realized for 2017. Also, see the section entitled Net Interest Income\u201d for additional information.\nWe recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $3.6 million (reduction of the allowance for loan losses) in 2018 compared to a provision for loan losses of $0.7 million in 2017. The negative provision for 2018 was due primarily to several large loan recoveries realized in the first quarter of 2018 totaling $3.7 million. See \"Provision for Loan Losses\" for additional discussion.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, noninterest income amounted to $58.9 million compared to $49.2 million for 2017. The primary reasons for the increase in core noninterest income in 2018 were the previously discussed bank acquisitions and an insurance agency acquisition completed late in 2017, as well as higher income realized from SBA consulting fees and SBA loan sale gains. See the section entitled Noninterest Income\u201d for additional information.\nNoninterest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to $156.5 million compared to $145.5 million in 2017. Most categories of noninterest expense experienced general increases in 2018 due to our growth, primarily due to the previously noted acquisitions. Also impacting expenses were other growth initiatives, including continued growth of SBA Complete and the SBA Lending Division. See the section entitled Noninterest Expense\u201d for additional information.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our effective tax rates were 21.3% and 32.1%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 was due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in December 2017 and reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2018 amounted to $5.9 billion, a 5.7% increase from a year earlier. Loan growth for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to $207 million, or 5.1%, and deposit growth amounted to $252.4 million, or 5.7%.\nOutlook for 2020\nOur outlook for 2020 is generally stable. We believe our local economies and business conditions will continue to be healthy and generally favorable and that we will continue to experience solid organic loan and deposit growth in 2020. However, we face challenges to growing our earnings primarily due to the interest rate environment and a likely increase in our provision for loan losses.\nThe Federal Reserve decreased short-term interest rates by 75 basis points in the second half of 2019 and longer term interest rates in the marketplace also declined in 2019 and are near historic lows. The lower interest rates have resulted in declining asset yields, which is expected to continue into 2020. On the funding side, prior to the interest rate declines, we already had a very low cost of funds and our ability to further lower those costs has been limited. These factors resulted in our net interest margin declining in the second half of 2019. We expect these net interest margin pressures to continue into 2020, which would negatively impact the earnings growth we would expect from projected increases in our loans and deposits.\nIn recent years, we have experienced improving trends in the levels of our nonperforming assets and loan losses have been low, and accordingly, we've recorded minimal provisions for loan losses. While we do not currently expect a significant rise in loan delinquencies or loan losses, we believe it is likely that we will need to record higher levels of provisions for loan losses than recent years to provide for loan growth and more normal levels of losses. Any credit deterioration would result in further increases. Furthermore, we believe the new accounting standard for reserving for loan losses, commonly referred to as CECL, will generally result in higher provisions for loan losses, especially during periods of loan growth.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and with general practices followed by the banking industry. Certain of these principles involve a significant amount of judgment and may involve the use of estimates based on our best assumptions at the time of the estimation. The allowance for loan losses, intangible assets, and the fair value and discount accretion of acquired loans are three policies we have identified as being more sensitive in terms of judgments and estimates, taking into account their overall potential impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nDue to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved, we have identified the accounting for the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses as an accounting policy critical to our consolidated financial statements. The provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio.\nOur determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based primarily on a mathematical model that estimates the appropriate allowance for loan losses. This model has two components. The first component involves the estimation of losses on individually evaluated impaired loans.\u201d A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement. A loan is specifically evaluated for an appropriate valuation allowance if the loan balance is above a prescribed evaluation threshold (which varies based on credit quality, accruing status, troubled debt restructured status, purchased credit impaired status, and type of collateral) and the loan is determined to be impaired. The estimated valuation allowance is the difference, if any, between the loan balance outstanding and the value of the impaired loan as determined by either 1) an estimate of the cash flows that we expect to receive from the borrower discounted at the loan's effective rate, or 2) in the case of a collateral-dependent loan, the fair value of the collateral.\nThe second component of the allowance model is an estimate of losses for all loans not considered to be impaired loans ( general reserve loans\u201d). General reserve loans are segregated into pools by loan type and risk grade and estimated loss percentages are assigned to each loan pool based on historical losses. The historical loss percentages are then adjusted for any environmental factors used to reflect changes in the collectability of the portfolio not captured by historical data.\nThe reserves estimated for individually evaluated impaired loans are then added to the reserve estimated for general reserve loans. This becomes our allocated allowance.\u201d The allocated allowance is compared to the actual allowance for loan losses recorded on our books and any adjustment necessary for the recorded allowance to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio is recorded as a provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses is a direct charge to earnings in the period recorded. Any remaining difference between the allocated allowance and the actual allowance for loan losses recorded on our books is our unallocated allowance.\u201d\nPurchased loans are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. Therefore, amounts deemed uncollectible at the acquisition date represent a discount to the loan value and become a part of the fair value calculation. Subsequent decreases in the amount expected to be collected result in a provision for loan losses with a corresponding increase in the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent increases in the amount expected to be collected are accreted into income over the life of the loan and this accretion is referred to as loan discount accretion.\u201d\nWithin the purchased loan portfolio, loans are deemed purchased credit impaired at acquisition if the bank believes it will not be able to collect all contractual cash flows. Performing loans with an unamortized discount or premium that are not deemed purchased credit impaired are considered to be purchased performing loans. Purchased credit impaired loans are individually evaluated as impaired loans, as described above, while purchased performing loans are evaluated as general reserve loans. For purchased performing loan pools, any computed allowance that is in excess of remaining net discounts is a component of the allocated allowance.\nAlthough we use the best information available to make evaluations, future material adjustments may be necessary if economic, operational, or other conditions change. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to\nrecognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners' judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations.\nFor further discussion, see Nonperforming Assets\u201d and Summary of Loan Loss Experience\u201d below.\nThe above discussion reflects our allowance for loan losses policy in effect for 2019. In 2020, our allowance for loan loss policy will be based on the current expected credit losses accounting guidance. See \"Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience\" for additional discussion.\nIntangible Assets\nDue to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved, we have also identified the accounting for intangible assets as an accounting policy critical to our consolidated financial statements.\nWhen we complete an acquisition transaction, the excess of the purchase price over the amount by which the fair market value of assets acquired exceeds the fair market value of liabilities assumed represents an intangible asset. We must then determine the identifiable portions of the intangible asset, with any remaining amount classified as goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets associated with these acquisitions are generally amortized over the estimated life of the related asset, whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment, but not systematically amortized. Assuming no goodwill impairment, it is beneficial to our future earnings to have a lower amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets and higher amount of goodwill as opposed to having a higher amount considered to be identifiable intangible assets and a lower amount classified as goodwill.\nThe primary identifiable intangible asset we typically record in connection with a whole bank or bank branch acquisition is the value of the core deposit intangible, whereas when we acquire an insurance agency or a consulting firm, as we did in 2016 and 2017, the primary identifiable intangible asset is the value of the acquired customer list. Determining the amount of identifiable intangible assets and their average lives involves multiple assumptions and estimates and is typically determined by performing a discounted cash flow analysis, which involves a combination of any or all of the following assumptions: customer attrition/runoff, alternative funding costs, deposit servicing costs, and discount rates. We typically engage a third party consultant to assist in each analysis. For the whole bank and bank branch transactions recorded to date, the core deposit intangibles have generally been estimated to have a life ranging from seven to ten years, with an accelerated rate of amortization. For insurance agency acquisitions, the identifiable intangible assets related to the customer lists were determined to have a life of ten to fifteen years, with amortization occurring on a straight-line basis. For SBA Complete, the consulting firm we acquired in 2016, the identifiable intangible asset related to the customer list was determined to have a life of approximately seven years, with amortization occurring on a straight-line basis.\nSubsequent to the initial recording of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, we amortize the identifiable intangible assets over their estimated average lives, as discussed above. In addition, on at least an annual basis, with the annual evaluation occurring on October 31 of each year, goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their related carrying value, including goodwill. We have three reporting units - 1) First Bank with $222.7 million in goodwill, 2) First Bank Insurance with $7.4 million in goodwill, and 3) SBA activities, including SBA Complete and our SBA Lending Division, with $4.3 million in goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit were ever to exceed its fair value, we would determine whether the implied fair value of the goodwill, using a discounted cash flow analysis, exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss would be recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Performing such a discounted cash flow analysis would involve the significant use of estimates and assumptions.\nIn our 2019 goodwill impairment evaluation, we concluded that the goodwill for each of our reporting units was not impaired.\nWe review identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our policy is that an impairment loss is recognized, equal to the difference between the asset's carrying amount and its fair value, if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Estimating future cash flows involves the use of multiple estimates and assumptions, such as those listed above.\nFair Value and Discount Accretion of Acquired Loans\nWe consider the determination of the initial fair value of acquired loans and the subsequent discount accretion of the purchased loans to involve a high degree of judgment and complexity.\nWe determine fair value accounting estimates of newly assumed assets and liabilities in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. However, the amount that we realize on these assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in our financial statements, based upon the timing of collections on the acquired loans in future periods. Because of inherent credit losses and interest rate marks associated with acquired loans, the amount that we record as the fair values for the loans is generally less than the contractual unpaid principal balance due from the borrowers, with the difference being referred to as the discount\u201d on the acquired loans. For non-impaired purchased loans, we accrete the discount over the lives of the loans in a manner consistent with the guidance for accounting for loan origination fees and costs.\nFor purchased credit-impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans, the excess of the cash flows initially expected to be collected over the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date (i.e., the accretable yield) is accreted into interest income over the estimated remaining life of the loans using the effective yield method, provided that the timing and the amount of future cash flows is reasonably estimable. Accordingly, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual and they are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized under accounting for PCI loans and not to contractual interest payments. The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference.\nSubsequent to an acquisition, estimates of cash flows expected to be collected are updated periodically based on updated assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. If there is a decrease in cash flows expected to be collected, the provision for loan losses is charged, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. If the Company has a probable increase in cash flows expected to be collected, we will first reverse any previously established allowance for loan losses and then increase interest income as a prospective yield adjustment over the remaining life of the loan. The impact of changes in variable interest rates is recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income.\nMerger and Acquisition Activity\nAs previously discussed, in 2017, we completed two full-bank acquisitions - Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank. Also in 2017, we completed the acquisition of an insurance agency headquartered in Albemarle, North Carolina.\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these acquisitions.\nANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet interest income, the spread\u201d between earnings on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, constitutes the largest source of our earnings. Other factors that significantly affect operating results are the provision for loan losses, noninterest income such as service fees and noninterest expenses such as salaries, occupancy expense, equipment expense and other overhead costs, as well as the effects of income taxes.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income on a reported basis amounted to $216.2 million in 2019, $207.4 million in 2018, and $164.7 million in 2017. For internal purposes and in the discussion that follows, we evaluate our net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis by adding the tax benefit realized from tax-exempt loans and securities to reported interest income. Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis amounted to $217.8 million in 2019, $209.0 million in 2018, and $167.3 million in 2017. Management believes that analysis of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis is useful and appropriate because it allows a comparison of net interest amounts in different periods without taking into account the different mix of taxable versus non-taxable loans and investments that may have existed during those periods. The following is a reconciliation of reported net interest income to tax-equivalent net interest income. The tax-equivalent adjustment declined significantly from 2017 to 2018 as a result of the decrease in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%.\n\nTable 2 analyzes our net interest income. Our net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased by 4.2% in 2019 and increased by 24.9% in 2018. There are two primary factors that cause changes in the amount of net interest income we record - 1) changes in our loans and deposits balances and 2) our net interest margin. Net interest margin\u201d is a ratio we use to measure the spread between the yield on our earning assets and the cost of our funding and is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.\nThe increase in net interest income in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to growth in our interest-earning assets. For 2019, average interest-earning assets increased $336.0 million, or 6.6%, including growth of $184.5 million in average loans and $281.3 million in average securities. The growth in interest-earning assets was driven by funds provided from growth in deposits.\nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.09% in 2018 to 4.00% in 2019, which partially offset the positive impact on net interest income of the growth of our interest-earning assets just discussed. The lower net interest margin was a result of our funding costs increasing by more than our asset yields, largely as a result of competitive pressures. In 2019, asset yields increased by seven basis points, from 4.52% in 2018 to 4.59% in 2019, primarily as a result of Federal Reserve interest rate increases during the second half of 2018. Average funding costs increased by 18 basis points in 2019, from 0.48% in 2018 to 0.66% in 2019.\nThe increase in net interest income in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to growth in levels of earning assets, as the net interest margin did not change significantly, amounting to 4.09% in 2019 compared to 4.08% in 2018. Excluding the impact of the tax-equivalent adjustment, our net interest income to average earning asset ratio increased from 4.02% to 4.06% as a result of asset yields that increased slightly more than our funding cost. Average earning assets grew by $1.0 billion in 2018, or 24.6%, with average loans growing by $740.9 million, or 21.7%, while average deposits increased by $820.1 million, or 22.2%. Most of increases in average loans and deposits were due to the acquisitions of Asheville Savings Bank and Carolina Bank during 2017.\nThe net interest margin for all periods benefited, by varying amounts, from the net accretion income, primarily associated with purchase accounting premiums/discounts associated with acquisitions. As can be seen in the table below, we recorded $6.0 million in 2019, $7.1 million in 2018, and $7.1 million in 2017 in net accretion that increased net interest income.\n\nThe biggest component of the purchase accounting adjustments in each year was loan discount accretion on purchased loans, which amounted to $4.6 million in 2019, $6.1 million in 2018, and $6.6 million in 2017. Most of this loan discount accretion relates to our 2017 acquisitions of Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank, with the declines in accretion being due to the natural paydowns in those acquired loan portfolios, which is expected to continue. In addition to the loan discount accretion recorded on acquired loans, we recorded loan discount accretion of $1.4 million, $0.9 million, and $0.2 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, on the discounts associated with the retained unguaranteed portions of SBA loans sold in the secondary market. We entered that line of business in late 2016 and the higher discount accretion on those loans is associated with the growth in that business.\nAt December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, unaccreted loan discount on purchased loans amounted to $12.7 million, $17.3 million, and $24.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, unaccreted loan discount on SBA loans amounted to $7.1 million, $5.7 million, and $2.6 million, respectively.\nTable 3 presents additional detail regarding the estimated impact that changes in loan and deposit volumes and changes in the interest rates we earned/paid had on our net interest income in 2018 and 2019. For 2019, higher loan volume positively impacted interest income by $9.3 million, and higher loan interest rates positively impacted interest income by $2.9 million, with the combined effect driving the increase in total interest income of $18.9 million. Higher volumes and higher rates paid on deposits drove an increase of $10.6 million in interest expense. Lower borrowings expense in 2019, which was driven by lower levels of borrowings, partially offset the increase in total interest expense by $0.4 million. Overall, as Table 3 indicates, net interest income grew $8.8 million in 2019, with higher volumes comprising $14.2 million of the increase, which was partially offset by a $5.5 million negative impact associated with changes in interest rates. As previously discussed, in 2019 our average funding costs increased by more than our average asset yields from 2018.\nFor 2018, Table 3 is significantly impacted by our 2017 acquisitions of Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank, which were fully reflected in our average balances in 2018 compared to only a portion of the year in 2017. For 2018, the higher amounts of loans and deposits outstanding drove a net increase of $38.1 million in net interest income, while the impact of changes in interest rates resulted in a $4.6 million increase in net interest income.\nIf our nonaccrual and restructured loans as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period (or since origination if held for part of the period), gross interest income in the amounts of approximately $1,763,000, $1,616,000, and $1,503,000 for nonaccrual loans and $662,000, $974,000, and $1,182,000, for restructured loans would have been recorded for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Interest income on such loans that was actually collected and included in net income in 2019, 2018 and 2017 amounted to approximately $759,000, $765,000, and $415,000 for nonaccrual loans (prior to their being placed on nonaccrual status), and $528,000, $763,000, and $885,000 for restructured loans, respectively. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose loans were nonperforming.\nSee additional information regarding net interest income in the section entitled Interest Rate Risk.\u201d\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Management's determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on our level of loan growth, an evaluation of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, historical loan loss experience and other risk factors.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $2.3 million, a negative provision for loan losses of $3.6 million, and a provision for loan losses of $0.7 million, respectively. In 2019, our provision for loan losses was higher than previous years primarily due to higher net charge-offs. The negative provision for 2018 was due primarily to several large loan recoveries realized in the first quarter of 2018 totaling $3.7 million. Although our provision for loan losses was higher in 2019, it continues a trend in recent years of being low compared to historical levels. The low levels of provision for loan losses recorded in recent years were primarily the result of a sustained period of stable and generally improving loan quality trends, which resulted in lower amounts of provision needed to adjust our allowance for loan losses to the appropriate amount. This is driven by our allowance for loan loss model, which utilizes the net charge-offs experienced in the most recent years as a significant component of estimating the current allowance for loan losses that is necessary. Thus, older years (and parts thereof) systematically age out and are excluded from the analysis as time goes on. For the last three years, the new periods being added into our model had generally lower levels of net charge-offs than the older periods rolling out of the model, and thus mostly offset provisions for loan losses that would normally be required to reflect new loan growth and the net charge-offs experienced. Thus, the low level of net charge-offs (or net recoveries) experienced in recent years has been the primary reason for the low (or negative) provisions for loan losses recorded.\nAs shown in Table 14, total net charge-offs (recoveries) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, were $1.9 million, ($1.3 million), and $1.2 million, respectively. The higher net charge-offs in 2019 resulted from lower loan recoveries in comparison to 2018 and 2017.\nIn 2018, we completed a loan sale of approximately $5.2 million in smaller balance nonperforming loans that resulted in loan charge-offs of $2.2 million. However, this was more than offset by full payoffs on four loans received in the first quarter of 2018 that resulted in recoveries to the allowance for loan losses of $3.3 million\nSee Nonperforming Assets\u201d below for further discussion of our asset quality, which impacts our provisions for loan losses.\nThe allowance is monitored and analyzed regularly in conjunction with our loan analysis and grading program, and adjustments are made to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. See the section entitled Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience\u201d below for a more detailed discussion of the allowance for loan losses, including discussion of a change in the way that we will reserve for credit losses beginning in 2020 that may increase the levels and volatility of our provision for loan losses\nNoninterest Income\nOur noninterest income amounted to $59.5 million in 2019, $58.9 million in 2018, and $49.2 million in 2017.\nSee Table 4 and the following discussion for an understanding of the components of noninterest income.\nManagement evaluates noninterest income on a non-GAAP basis that excludes items such as securities gains and losses and other miscellaneous gains and losses. We refer to this as \"adjusted noninterest income.\" Adjusted noninterest income amounted to $59.6 million in 2019, a 2.4% increase from the $58.2 million recorded in 2018. The 2018 adjusted noninterest income of $58.2 million was an 18.6% increase from the $49.1 million recorded in 2017. Comparisons to 2017 for several line items are significantly impacted by our 2017 acquisitions, which resulted in the noninterest income generated by those entities only impacting 2017 for a partial year compared to the full year impact in 2018 and 2019.\nService charges on deposit accounts amounted to $13.0 million, $12.7 million, and $11.9 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We believe the increase in 2019 is primarily due to growth in our number of checking accounts, which we have promoted with new product offerings. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to the aforementioned acquisitions.\nOther service charges, commissions and fees amounted to $19.5 million in 2019, an 18.2% increase from the $16.5 million in 2018. The 2018 amount of $16.5 million was 14.5% higher than the $14.4 million earned in 2017. This category of noninterest income includes items such as interchange fees, ATM charges, safety deposit box rentals, fees from sales of personalized checks, and check cashing fees. The increase in this line item in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to growth in interchange fees that we earn when our customers use their debit and credit cards issued by our bank. Net interchange fees amounted to $13.8 million in 2019 compared to $12.0 million in 2018, an increase of 15.2%. We believe the growth in card usage by our customers is due to customer payment preferences, as well as a result of ongoing promotion of these products. General growth of our bank also contributed to the increase in this line item in 2019. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to the aforementioned acquisitions.\nFees from presold mortgages amounted to $3.9 million in 2019, $2.7 million in 2018, and $5.7 million in 2017. The increase in 2019 was due to increased volumes in the mortgage industry due to declining interest rates, as well as the hiring of additional loan originators. The decline from 2017 to 2018 was due to: i) overall lower volumes in the mortgage industry as a result of higher interest rates, ii) our Mortgage Loan Division originating a higher percentage of loans with construction components that are held in our loan portfolio and not sold, and iii) mortgage origination employees who left the Company in 2018.\nCommissions from sales of insurance and financial products amounted to $8.5 million in 2019, $8.7 million in 2018, and $5.3 million in 2017. This line item includes commissions we receive from two primary sources - 1) commissions from the sales of investment, annuity, and long term care insurance products, and 2) commissions from the sale of property and casualty insurance. The following table presents the contribution of each source to the total amount recognized in this line item:\n\nAs can be seen in the above table, sales of property and casualty insurance increased significantly in 2018, which was due to our September 1, 2017 acquisition of Bear Insurance Services (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information). The decline in in this line item in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to lower contingent commissions, which can vary significantly and are impacted by the claims experience of the insurance carriers used by the Company. Sales of investments, annuities and long term care insurance increased in 2018 and 2019 due to the increased growth and promotion of this line of business.\nWe began offering SBA consulting services in 2016 with our May 2016 acquisition of SBA Complete. In this line of business, SBA Complete assists community banks throughout the nation with SBA origination and servicing activities. SBA consulting fees amounted to $3.9 million in 2019, $4.7 million in 2018 and $4.0 million in 2017. The variances among the years are associated with changes in the origination activity of our client banks.\nShortly after the acquisition of SBA Complete, we began a SBA Lending Division, which originates SBA loans throughout the nation and sells the SBA guaranteed portion of those loans, which results in loan sale gains. Loan sale volume can be volatile based on origination activity and the timing of the funding of loans in the pipeline. This division generated $5.5 million in SBA loan sale gains in 2017. In 2018, this division added originators and generated $10.4 million in gains from sales. In 2019, loan sale gains of $8.3 million were realized, with the decline from 2018 being due to the natural volatility discussed above, as well as lower loan sale premiums commanded by the buyers of these loans for much of the year.\nTable 4 shows earnings from bank-owned life insurance income were $2.6 million in 2019, $2.5 million in 2018, and $2.3 million in 2017, with the increases being driven by growth in the underlying life insurance asset.\nSecurities gains of losses were not significant in the years presented, with 2019 having a net gain of $0.1 million, 2018 having no gains or losses, and 2017 having a net loss of $0.2 million.\nOther gains (losses), net\u201d amounted to a net loss of $0.2 million for 2019, a net gain of $0.7 million in 2018, and a net gain of $0.4 million in 2017. This line item represents the net effects of miscellaneous gains and losses that are non-routine in nature. The net gain of $0.7 million in 2018 primarily related to a gain on the sale of a previously closed branch building.\nNoninterest Expenses\nTotal noninterest expenses totaled $157.2 million, $156.5 million, $145.5 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Table 5 presents the components of our noninterest expense during the past three years. Comparisons to 2017 are impacted by our 2017 acquisitions, which resulted in the noninterest expense of those entities only impacting 2017 for a partial year compared to the full year impact in 2018 and 2019.\nTotal personnel expense increased from $92.0 million in 2018 to $96.0 million in 2019, an increase of $4.0 million, or 4.4%. Within personnel expense, salaries expense increased $4.0 million, or 5.4%, while employee benefits expense was approximately the same in 2018 and 2019 at approximately $16.9 million. Salaries expense increased primarily due to normal wage increases for our employees, as well as the hiring of several experienced bankers. Within employee benefits, health care expense, for which the Company is self-insured, is the single largest item and was unchanged in 2019 compared to 2018.\nIn 2018, total personnel expense increased from $82.1 million in 2017 to $92.0 million in 2018, an increase of $9.9 million, or 12.0%. The primary reason for these increase was the aforementioned acquisitions which impacted 2108 for a full year compared to a partial year in 2017. Also, approximately $1.3 million of the increase in personnel expense in 2018 can be attributed to increases in salaries expense related to our SBA lending activities. Also impacting personnel expense in 2018 was an increase in the 401(k) match offered by the Company to employees that was effective January 1, 2018, which increased from a 100% match up to 4% of an employee's salary contribution to a 100% match up to 6% of an employee's salary contribution.\nNet occupancy expenses amounted to $11.1 million in 2019, $10.8 million in 2018, and $9.7 million in 2017. The increase in 2019 is primarily related to increased rent expense associated with several new leases executed during the year. The increases in 2018 were related to the aforementioned acquisitions and expansion initiatives.\nEquipment related expenses amounted to $5.0 million, $5.6 million, and $4.5 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. In 2018, we accelerated $0.3 million in depreciation expense associated with our ATM fleet in anticipation of replacing our ATM's in early 2019. This resulted in a decline in ATM depreciation expense in 2019, as well as lower associated repairs and maintenance costs. In 2018, the increase in this line item related to the aforementioned acquisitions and expansion initiatives.\nMerger and acquisition expenses amounted to $0.2 million in 2019, $2.4 million in 2018, and $8.1 million in 2017. The 2018 amount was primarily comprised of severance costs and data processing conversion expenses related to the acquisition of Asheville Savings Bank. The 2017 amount was primarily comprised of professional fees and severance costs incurred in our acquisitions of Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank.\nIntangible amortization expense amounted to $4.9 million, $5.9 million and $4.0 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase from 2017 to 2018 was due to the addition of $22.5 million in amortizable intangible assets recorded in connection with the 2017 acquisitions of Carolina Bank, Asheville Savings Bank, and Bear Insurance Services. In 2019, intangible amortization expense declined to $4.9 million due to the amortization schedules of those intangible assets generally declining over time.\nFDIC insurance expense amounted to $0.3 million in 2019, $2.3 million in 2018, and $2.4 million in 2017. As discussed previously in the section FDIC Insurance\u201d, in 2019, we received an assessment credit of $1.3 million that was used to offset FDIC insurance expense in the last three quarters of 2019.\nOutside consultant expenses amounted to $1.5 million in 2019, $1.8 million in 2018, $2.5 million in 2017, with 2017 being impacted by consulting expense associated with various operational activities and enhancements.\nData processing expenses did not vary significantly among the periods presented, amounting to $3.1 million $3.2 million, $2.9 million, in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nMarketing expense amounted to $2.7 million in 2019, $3.1 million in 2018, and $2.5 million in 2017. In 2018, we initiated special promotional efforts in our new and expanded market areas.\nNon-credit losses remained relatively unchanged for the periods presented, amounting to $1.0 million in 2019, $1.0 million in 2018, and $0.9 million in 2017. These losses primarily related to debit card and credit card fraud losses.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 6 presents the components of income tax expense and the related effective tax rates. We recorded income tax expense of $24.2 million in 2019, $24.2 million in 2018, and $21.8 million in 2017. Our effective tax rates were 20.8% for 2019, 21.3% for 2018, and 32.1% for 2017. The lower effective rates in 2019 and 2018 compared to 2017 were the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017, which reduced the federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%. At December 31, 2017, we revalued our net deferred tax liability, which reduced income tax expense by $1.3 million for 2017, while in 2018, the new income tax rate of 21% reduced our effective tax rate from 2017.\nAlso, our effective tax rate has been impacted in recent years due lower statutory income tax rates in North Carolina. North Carolina reduced the state income tax rate for corporations from 4.0% in 2017 to 3.0% in 2018 and to 2.5% in 2019, which is where it remains for 2020. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 21.0% in 2020.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recorded stock-based compensation expense of $2.3 million, $1.6 million, and $1.1 million, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increases in this expense have been due to retention-based restricted stock grants made to certain officers during the years presented. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding stock-based compensation.\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION\nOverview\nAt December 31, 2019, our total assets amounted to $6.1 billion, a 4.8% increase from 2018. The following table presents detailed information regarding the nature of changes in our loans and deposits in 2018 and 2019. There were no acquisitions impacting year over year growth for either year.\n\nAs shown in the table above, in 2019 and 2018, our total loans outstanding increased $204.4 million, or 4.8%, and $206.7 million, or 5.1%, respectively. Loan growth for the periods was organic and primarily driven by our expansion in high-growth markets, hiring of experienced bankers, and increases in SBA lending. We expect continued growth in our loan portfolio for 2020.\nDuring 2019, we experienced an increase in total deposits of $272.0 million, or 5.8%. Within total deposits, we grew our retail deposits (non-brokered deposits) by $426 million, or 9.6%. Within our retail deposits, we experienced growth of $321.9 million, or 8.7%, in checking, money market and savings accounts, and had growth of $106.6 million, or 15.0%, in our retail time deposits. We routinely engage in activities designed to grow and retain deposits, such as (1) emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with us, (2) pricing deposits at rate levels that will attract and/or retain deposits, and (3) continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or\nenhance our appeal as a primary provider of financial services. The high retail deposit growth in 2019 allowed us to reduce our level of brokered deposits by $154 million, or 64.1% during the year. Additionally, we were able to pay down our borrowings in 2019 by $106 million.\nDuring 2018, we experienced an increase in total deposits of $252.4 million, or 5.7%, which was substantially all retail deposit growth. Within our retail deposits, we experienced growth of $186.3 million, or 5.3%, in checking, money market and savings accounts, and had growth of $70.4 million, or 11.0%, in our retail time deposits.\nOur overall liquidity did not vary significantly at December 31, 2019 compared to a year earlier. Our liquid assets (cash and securities) as a percentage of our total deposits and borrowings was 21.4% at December 31, 2019 compared to 21.0% at December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2019, our nonperforming assets to total assets ratio was 0.62% compared to 0.74% at December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to on-going resolution of nonperforming assets and improving credit quality.\nDistribution of Assets and Liabilities\nTable 7 sets forth the percentage relationships of significant components of our balance sheet at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nOur balance sheet mix has remained relatively stable over the past three years. On the asset side, net loans have consistently comprised 72% to 73% of total assets and interest-earning assets have ranged from 88%-90%. In both 2018 and 2019, we used excess cash balances to purchase available for sale securities, which resulted in our mix of securities available for sale increasing from 6% of total assets at year end 2017 to 9% of total assets at the end of 2018 and to 13% of total assets at the end of 2019.\nOn the liability side, deposits have consistently comprised 79% to 80% of total liabilities and shareholders' equity. In 2019, we paid down our borrowings by $106 million, which resulted in our borrowings decreasing to 5% of total liabilities and shareholders' equity from 7% at the two prior year ends.\nShareholders' equity increased from 12% of total liabilities and shareholders' equity at December 31, 2017 to 14% at December 31, 2019 due to increases in retained earnings due to high levels of net income recorded.\nSecurities\nInformation regarding our securities portfolio as of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 is presented in Tables 8 and 9.\nThe composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income. The investment portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds, furnishing liquidity, and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits. We obtain fair values for our investment securities from a third-party investment recordkeeper, who specializes in securities purchases and sales, recordkeeping, and valuation. This recordkeeper provides us with a third-party report that contains an evaluation of internal controls that includes testwork of securities valuation. We further test the values we receive by comparing the values for a significant sample of securities to another third-party valuation service on a quarterly basis.\nTotal securities amounted to $889.9 million, $602.6 million, and $461.8 million at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increase in securities in 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to purchases of fixed rate securities that we initiated to realize higher yields and to protect the Company from expectations of falling interest rates. To fund the purchases, we primarily used interest-bearing cash balances, which earn interest tied to the federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve.\nThe majority of our government-sponsored enterprise\u201d securities carry one maturity date, often with an issuer call feature. At December 31, 2019, of the $20.0 million in available for sale government-sponsored enterprise securities, $15.0 million were issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank system and the remaining $5 million were issued by the Federal Farm Credit Bank system.\nNearly all of our $767.3 million in available for sale mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2019 were issued by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, or the SBA, each of which is a government agency or government-sponsored corporation and guarantees the repayment of the securities. Included in this total are commercial mortgage-backed securities of $262.3 million. Mortgage-backed securities vary in their repayment in correlation with the underlying pools of mortgage loans.\nOur investment policy permits us to hold up to 15% of our securities portfolio in corporate bonds. These bonds have the most credit risk of any of our securities. At December 31, 2019, our $34.7 million investment in corporate bonds was comprised of the following:\n\n____________________________________________________________\n (1) Ratings issued by Moody's \n (2) Rating issued by Kroll Bond Rating Agency.  We have concluded that any unrealized losses associated with our corporate bonds are due to interest rate considerations and not due to credit concerns.\nAt December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, net unrealized gains (losses) of $9.7 million, ($12.4 million), and ($2.2 million), respectively, were included in the carrying value of securities classified as available for sale. Management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates and the overall economic environment, not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations. Net unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable deferred income taxes, are included as part of a separate component of shareholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income) as of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2019, we held $67.9 million in securities classified as held to maturity, which are carried at amortized cost. These securities had fair values that exceeded their carrying values by $0.4 million December 31, 2019. Approximately $41.4 million of the securities held to maturity are mortgage-backed securities that have been issued by either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. The remaining $26.5 million in securities held to maturity are comprised almost entirely of municipal bonds issued by", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding our results of operations and changes in financial position for the past three years. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page 70 of this report and the supplemental financial data contained in Tables 1 through 22 beginning on page 53 of this report. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. The following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nOverview - 2019 Compared to 2018\nWe reported net income per diluted common share of $3.10 in 2019, a 3.0% increase compared to 2018. Our outstanding loan balances increased by 4.8% and total deposits increased 5.8%.\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Highlights\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands except per share data)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>207,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (reversal) for loan losses\n</td> <td>2,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,589\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest income\n</td> <td>59,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest expenses\n</td> <td>157,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>116,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>24,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>3.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balances At Year End\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,143,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,864,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans\n</td> <td>4,453,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,249,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits\n</td> <td>4,931,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,659,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratios\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average assets\n</td> <td>1.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average common equity\n</td> <td>11.32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest margin (taxable-equivalent)\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.09\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>n/m - not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded net income of $92.0 million, or $3.10 per diluted common share, an increase of 3% in earnings per share from the $89.3 million, or $3.01 per diluted common share, for 2018. The higher earnings in 2019 were primarily related to higher net interest income associated with our growth.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $216.2 million, a 4.2% increase from the $207.4 million recorded in 2018. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to growth in interest-earning assets. Also, see the section entitled Net Interest Income\u201d for additional information.\nOur net interest margin (tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets) was 4.00% for 2019 compared to 4.09% for 2018. The decrease in the net interest margin realized in 2019 was primarily due to a combination of lower loan discount accretion and lower asset yields.\nWe recorded a provision for loan losses of $2.3 million in 2019 compared to negative provision for loan losses of $3.6 million (reduction of the allowance for loan losses) in 2018. The negative provision for 2018 was due primarily to several large loan recoveries realized in the first quarter of 2018 totaling $3.7 million. Generally, our provisions for loan losses have been low over the past several years due to strong asset quality, including low loan charge-offs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, noninterest income amounted to $59.5 million compared to $58.9 million for 2018, an increase of 1.0%. Increases were experienced in i) service charges on deposit accounts due to strong deposit growth, ii) interchange income due to increased credit and debit card usage, and iii) in fees from presold mortgages due to higher mortgage origination activity. Those increases were substantially offset by lower SBA loan sale gains and lower SBA consulting fees. See the section entitled Noninterest Income\u201d for additional information.\nNoninterest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $157.2 million compared to $156.5 million in 2018, an increase of 0.5%. A 5.4% increase in salaries expense associated with wage increases and the growth of the Company was substantially offset by lower merger and acquisition expenses and lower intangibles amortization expense. See the section entitled Noninterest Expense\u201d for additional information.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2019 amounted to $6.1 billion, a 4.8% increase from a year earlier. Loan growth for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $204.4 million, or 4.8%, and deposit growth amounted to $272.0 million, or 5.8%. Within deposits, our retail deposits (excludes brokered deposits and internet time deposits) grew 9.7% during 2019, with 14.8% growth in noninterest-bearing checking accounts. As a result of the strong retail deposit growth, we reduced our level of brokered deposits by $153.7 million, or 64.1%, from $239.9 million at December 31, 2018 to $86.1 million at December 31, 2019. Internet time deposits decreased from $3.4 million at December 31, 2018 to $0.7 million at December 31, 2019. Additionally, we paid down borrowings by $106 million, or 26.0%, during 2019.\nDuring 2019, we repurchased 281,593 shares of the Company's common stock at an average price of $35.51, which totaled $10 million. As of December 31, 2019, we had $40 million of additional share repurchase authority, which has an expiration date of December 31, 2020.\nOverview - 2018 Compared to 2017\nWe reported net income per diluted common share of $3.01 in 2018, a 65.4% increase compared to the $1.82 per share earnings for 2017. In 2018, a full year of earnings and cost efficiencies realized from two significant 2017 acquisitions drove the increase in earnings. Our loan balances, total assets and deposits all grew 5%-6%.\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Highlights\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands except per share data)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>207,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (reversal) for loan losses\n</td> <td>(3,589\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest income\n</td> <td>58,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest expenses\n</td> <td>156,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>113,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>24,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>3.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balances At Year End\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,864,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,547,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans\n</td> <td>4,249,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,042,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits\n</td> <td>4,659,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,406,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratios\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average assets\n</td> <td>1.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average common equity\n</td> <td>12.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest margin (taxable-equivalent)\n</td> <td>4.09\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.08\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>n/m - not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded net income of $89.3 million, or $3.01 per diluted common share, an increase of 65.4% in earnings per share from the $46.0 million, or $1.82 per diluted common share, for 2017. The higher earnings in 2018 were primarily due to the acquisitions of Carolina Bank on March 3, 2017 and Asheville Savings Bank on October 1, 2017. The assets, liabilities and earnings for the acquisitions were recorded beginning on their respective acquisition dates. Therefore, the year 2018 included twelve months of earnings from the acquisition compared to only a partial year in 2017. Earnings and earnings per share for 2018 also benefited\nfrom operational efficiencies that were realized in the integration of the acquisitions that became fully realized in the final three quarters of 2018.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to $207.4 million, a 25.9% increase from the $164.7 million recorded in 2017. The increase in net interest income was due primarily to growth in interest-earning assets, which for the twelve month period was impacted by assets acquired in the Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank acquisitions. Our net interest margin (tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets) of 4.09% for 2018 did not vary significantly from the 4.08% realized for 2017. Also, see the section entitled Net Interest Income\u201d for additional information.\nWe recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $3.6 million (reduction of the allowance for loan losses) in 2018 compared to a provision for loan losses of $0.7 million in 2017. The negative provision for 2018 was due primarily to several large loan recoveries realized in the first quarter of 2018 totaling $3.7 million. See \"Provision for Loan Losses\" for additional discussion.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, noninterest income amounted to $58.9 million compared to $49.2 million for 2017. The primary reasons for the increase in core noninterest income in 2018 were the previously discussed bank acquisitions and an insurance agency acquisition completed late in 2017, as well as higher income realized from SBA consulting fees and SBA loan sale gains. See the section entitled Noninterest Income\u201d for additional information.\nNoninterest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to $156.5 million compared to $145.5 million in 2017. Most categories of noninterest expense experienced general increases in 2018 due to our growth, primarily due to the previously noted acquisitions. Also impacting expenses were other growth initiatives, including continued growth of SBA Complete and the SBA Lending Division. See the section entitled Noninterest Expense\u201d for additional information.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our effective tax rates were 21.3% and 32.1%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 was due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in December 2017 and reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2018 amounted to $5.9 billion, a 5.7% increase from a year earlier. Loan growth for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to $207 million, or 5.1%, and deposit growth amounted to $252.4 million, or 5.7%.\nOutlook for 2020\nOur outlook for 2020 is generally stable. We believe our local economies and business conditions will continue to be healthy and generally favorable and that we will continue to experience solid organic loan and deposit growth in 2020. However, we face challenges to growing our earnings primarily due to the interest rate environment and a likely increase in our provision for loan losses.\nThe Federal Reserve decreased short-term interest rates by 75 basis points in the second half of 2019 and longer term interest rates in the marketplace also declined in 2019 and are near historic lows. The lower interest rates have resulted in declining asset yields, which is expected to continue into 2020. On the funding side, prior to the interest rate declines, we already had a very low cost of funds and our ability to further lower those costs has been limited. These factors resulted in our net interest margin declining in the second half of 2019. We expect these net interest margin pressures to continue into 2020, which would negatively impact the earnings growth we would expect from projected increases in our loans and deposits.\nIn recent years, we have experienced improving trends in the levels of our nonperforming assets and loan losses have been low, and accordingly, we've recorded minimal provisions for loan losses. While we do not currently expect a significant rise in loan delinquencies or loan losses, we believe it is likely that we will need to record higher levels of provisions for loan losses than recent years to provide for loan growth and more normal levels of losses. Any credit deterioration would result in further increases. Furthermore, we believe the new accounting standard for reserving for loan losses, commonly referred to as CECL, will generally result in higher provisions for loan losses, especially during periods of loan growth.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and with general practices followed by the banking industry. Certain of these principles involve a significant amount of judgment and may involve the use of estimates based on our best assumptions at the time of the estimation. The allowance for loan losses, intangible assets, and the fair value and discount accretion of acquired loans are three policies we have identified as being more sensitive in terms of judgments and estimates, taking into account their overall potential impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nDue to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved, we have identified the accounting for the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses as an accounting policy critical to our consolidated financial statements. The provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio.\nOur determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based primarily on a mathematical model that estimates the appropriate allowance for loan losses. This model has two components. The first component involves the estimation of losses on individually evaluated impaired loans.\u201d A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement. A loan is specifically evaluated for an appropriate valuation allowance if the loan balance is above a prescribed evaluation threshold (which varies based on credit quality, accruing status, troubled debt restructured status, purchased credit impaired status, and type of collateral) and the loan is determined to be impaired. The estimated valuation allowance is the difference, if any, between the loan balance outstanding and the value of the impaired loan as determined by either 1) an estimate of the cash flows that we expect to receive from the borrower discounted at the loan's effective rate, or 2) in the case of a collateral-dependent loan, the fair value of the collateral.\nThe second component of the allowance model is an estimate of losses for all loans not considered to be impaired loans ( general reserve loans\u201d). General reserve loans are segregated into pools by loan type and risk grade and estimated loss percentages are assigned to each loan pool based on historical losses. The historical loss percentages are then adjusted for any environmental factors used to reflect changes in the collectability of the portfolio not captured by historical data.\nThe reserves estimated for individually evaluated impaired loans are then added to the reserve estimated for general reserve loans. This becomes our allocated allowance.\u201d The allocated allowance is compared to the actual allowance for loan losses recorded on our books and any adjustment necessary for the recorded allowance to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio is recorded as a provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses is a direct charge to earnings in the period recorded. Any remaining difference between the allocated allowance and the actual allowance for loan losses recorded on our books is our unallocated allowance.\u201d\nPurchased loans are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. Therefore, amounts deemed uncollectible at the acquisition date represent a discount to the loan value and become a part of the fair value calculation. Subsequent decreases in the amount expected to be collected result in a provision for loan losses with a corresponding increase in the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent increases in the amount expected to be collected are accreted into income over the life of the loan and this accretion is referred to as loan discount accretion.\u201d\nWithin the purchased loan portfolio, loans are deemed purchased credit impaired at acquisition if the bank believes it will not be able to collect all contractual cash flows. Performing loans with an unamortized discount or premium that are not deemed purchased credit impaired are considered to be purchased performing loans. Purchased credit impaired loans are individually evaluated as impaired loans, as described above, while purchased performing loans are evaluated as general reserve loans. For purchased performing loan pools, any computed allowance that is in excess of remaining net discounts is a component of the allocated allowance.\nAlthough we use the best information available to make evaluations, future material adjustments may be necessary if economic, operational, or other conditions change. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to\nrecognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners' judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations.\nFor further discussion, see Nonperforming Assets\u201d and Summary of Loan Loss Experience\u201d below.\nThe above discussion reflects our allowance for loan losses policy in effect for 2019. In 2020, our allowance for loan loss policy will be based on the current expected credit losses accounting guidance. See \"Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience\" for additional discussion.\nIntangible Assets\nDue to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved, we have also identified the accounting for intangible assets as an accounting policy critical to our consolidated financial statements.\nWhen we complete an acquisition transaction, the excess of the purchase price over the amount by which the fair market value of assets acquired exceeds the fair market value of liabilities assumed represents an intangible asset. We must then determine the identifiable portions of the intangible asset, with any remaining amount classified as goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets associated with these acquisitions are generally amortized over the estimated life of the related asset, whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment, but not systematically amortized. Assuming no goodwill impairment, it is beneficial to our future earnings to have a lower amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets and higher amount of goodwill as opposed to having a higher amount considered to be identifiable intangible assets and a lower amount classified as goodwill.\nThe primary identifiable intangible asset we typically record in connection with a whole bank or bank branch acquisition is the value of the core deposit intangible, whereas when we acquire an insurance agency or a consulting firm, as we did in 2016 and 2017, the primary identifiable intangible asset is the value of the acquired customer list. Determining the amount of identifiable intangible assets and their average lives involves multiple assumptions and estimates and is typically determined by performing a discounted cash flow analysis, which involves a combination of any or all of the following assumptions: customer attrition/runoff, alternative funding costs, deposit servicing costs, and discount rates. We typically engage a third party consultant to assist in each analysis. For the whole bank and bank branch transactions recorded to date, the core deposit intangibles have generally been estimated to have a life ranging from seven to ten years, with an accelerated rate of amortization. For insurance agency acquisitions, the identifiable intangible assets related to the customer lists were determined to have a life of ten to fifteen years, with amortization occurring on a straight-line basis. For SBA Complete, the consulting firm we acquired in 2016, the identifiable intangible asset related to the customer list was determined to have a life of approximately seven years, with amortization occurring on a straight-line basis.\nSubsequent to the initial recording of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, we amortize the identifiable intangible assets over their estimated average lives, as discussed above. In addition, on at least an annual basis, with the annual evaluation occurring on October 31 of each year, goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their related carrying value, including goodwill. We have three reporting units - 1) First Bank with $222.7 million in goodwill, 2) First Bank Insurance with $7.4 million in goodwill, and 3) SBA activities, including SBA Complete and our SBA Lending Division, with $4.3 million in goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit were ever to exceed its fair value, we would determine whether the implied fair value of the goodwill, using a discounted cash flow analysis, exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss would be recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Performing such a discounted cash flow analysis would involve the significant use of estimates and assumptions.\nIn our 2019 goodwill impairment evaluation, we concluded that the goodwill for each of our reporting units was not impaired.\nWe review identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our policy is that an impairment loss is recognized, equal to the difference between the asset's carrying amount and its fair value, if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Estimating future cash flows involves the use of multiple estimates and assumptions, such as those listed above.\nFair Value and Discount Accretion of Acquired Loans\nWe consider the determination of the initial fair value of acquired loans and the subsequent discount accretion of the purchased loans to involve a high degree of judgment and complexity.\nWe determine fair value accounting estimates of newly assumed assets and liabilities in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. However, the amount that we realize on these assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in our financial statements, based upon the timing of collections on the acquired loans in future periods. Because of inherent credit losses and interest rate marks associated with acquired loans, the amount that we record as the fair values for the loans is generally less than the contractual unpaid principal balance due from the borrowers, with the difference being referred to as the discount\u201d on the acquired loans. For non-impaired purchased loans, we accrete the discount over the lives of the loans in a manner consistent with the guidance for accounting for loan origination fees and costs.\nFor purchased credit-impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans, the excess of the cash flows initially expected to be collected over the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date (i.e., the accretable yield) is accreted into interest income over the estimated remaining life of the loans using the effective yield method, provided that the timing and the amount of future cash flows is reasonably estimable. Accordingly, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual and they are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized under accounting for PCI loans and not to contractual interest payments. The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference.\nSubsequent to an acquisition, estimates of cash flows expected to be collected are updated periodically based on updated assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. If there is a decrease in cash flows expected to be collected, the provision for loan losses is charged, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. If the Company has a probable increase in cash flows expected to be collected, we will first reverse any previously established allowance for loan losses and then increase interest income as a prospective yield adjustment over the remaining life of the loan. The impact of changes in variable interest rates is recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income.\nMerger and Acquisition Activity\nAs previously discussed, in 2017, we completed two full-bank acquisitions - Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank. Also in 2017, we completed the acquisition of an insurance agency headquartered in Albemarle, North Carolina.\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these acquisitions.\nANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet interest income, the spread\u201d between earnings on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, constitutes the largest source of our earnings. Other factors that significantly affect operating results are the provision for loan losses, noninterest income such as service fees and noninterest expenses such as salaries, occupancy expense, equipment expense and other overhead costs, as well as the effects of income taxes.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income on a reported basis amounted to $216.2 million in 2019, $207.4 million in 2018, and $164.7 million in 2017. For internal purposes and in the discussion that follows, we evaluate our net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis by adding the tax benefit realized from tax-exempt loans and securities to reported interest income. Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis amounted to $217.8 million in 2019, $209.0 million in 2018, and $167.3 million in 2017. Management believes that analysis of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis is useful and appropriate because it allows a comparison of net interest amounts in different periods without taking into account the different mix of taxable versus non-taxable loans and investments that may have existed during those periods. The following is a reconciliation of reported net interest income to tax-equivalent net interest income. The tax-equivalent adjustment declined significantly from 2017 to 2018 as a result of the decrease in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>207,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax-equivalent adjustment\n</td> <td>1,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income, tax-equivalent\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>217,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 2 analyzes our net interest income. Our net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased by 4.2% in 2019 and increased by 24.9% in 2018. There are two primary factors that cause changes in the amount of net interest income we record - 1) changes in our loans and deposits balances and 2) our net interest margin. Net interest margin\u201d is a ratio we use to measure the spread between the yield on our earning assets and the cost of our funding and is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.\nThe increase in net interest income in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to growth in our interest-earning assets. For 2019, average interest-earning assets increased $336.0 million, or 6.6%, including growth of $184.5 million in average loans and $281.3 million in average securities. The growth in interest-earning assets was driven by funds provided from growth in deposits.\nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.09% in 2018 to 4.00% in 2019, which partially offset the positive impact on net interest income of the growth of our interest-earning assets just discussed. The lower net interest margin was a result of our funding costs increasing by more than our asset yields, largely as a result of competitive pressures. In 2019, asset yields increased by seven basis points, from 4.52% in 2018 to 4.59% in 2019, primarily as a result of Federal Reserve interest rate increases during the second half of 2018. Average funding costs increased by 18 basis points in 2019, from 0.48% in 2018 to 0.66% in 2019.\nThe increase in net interest income in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to growth in levels of earning assets, as the net interest margin did not change significantly, amounting to 4.09% in 2019 compared to 4.08% in 2018. Excluding the impact of the tax-equivalent adjustment, our net interest income to average earning asset ratio increased from 4.02% to 4.06% as a result of asset yields that increased slightly more than our funding cost. Average earning assets grew by $1.0 billion in 2018, or 24.6%, with average loans growing by $740.9 million, or 21.7%, while average deposits increased by $820.1 million, or 22.2%. Most of increases in average loans and deposits were due to the acquisitions of Asheville Savings Bank and Carolina Bank during 2017.\nThe net interest margin for all periods benefited, by varying amounts, from the net accretion income, primarily associated with purchase accounting premiums/discounts associated with acquisitions. As can be seen in the table below, we recorded $6.0 million in 2019, $7.1 million in 2018, and $7.1 million in 2017 in net accretion that increased net interest income.\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income - increased by accretion of loan discount on acquired loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income - increased by accretion of loan discount on retained SBA loans\n</td> <td>1,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - reduced by premium amortization of deposits\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - increased by discount accretion of borrowings\n</td> <td>(181\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(181\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(148\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact on net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe biggest component of the purchase accounting adjustments in each year was loan discount accretion on purchased loans, which amounted to $4.6 million in 2019, $6.1 million in 2018, and $6.6 million in 2017. Most of this loan discount accretion relates to our 2017 acquisitions of Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank, with the declines in accretion being due to the natural paydowns in those acquired loan portfolios, which is expected to continue. In addition to the loan discount accretion recorded on acquired loans, we recorded loan discount accretion of $1.4 million, $0.9 million, and $0.2 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, on the discounts associated with the retained unguaranteed portions of SBA loans sold in the secondary market. We entered that line of business in late 2016 and the higher discount accretion on those loans is associated with the growth in that business.\nAt December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, unaccreted loan discount on purchased loans amounted to $12.7 million, $17.3 million, and $24.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, unaccreted loan discount on SBA loans amounted to $7.1 million, $5.7 million, and $2.6 million, respectively.\nTable 3 presents additional detail regarding the estimated impact that changes in loan and deposit volumes and changes in the interest rates we earned/paid had on our net interest income in 2018 and 2019. For 2019, higher loan volume positively impacted interest income by $9.3 million, and higher loan interest rates positively impacted interest income by $2.9 million, with the combined effect driving the increase in total interest income of $18.9 million. Higher volumes and higher rates paid on deposits drove an increase of $10.6 million in interest expense. Lower borrowings expense in 2019, which was driven by lower levels of borrowings, partially offset the increase in total interest expense by $0.4 million. Overall, as Table 3 indicates, net interest income grew $8.8 million in 2019, with higher volumes comprising $14.2 million of the increase, which was partially offset by a $5.5 million negative impact associated with changes in interest rates. As previously discussed, in 2019 our average funding costs increased by more than our average asset yields from 2018.\nFor 2018, Table 3 is significantly impacted by our 2017 acquisitions of Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank, which were fully reflected in our average balances in 2018 compared to only a portion of the year in 2017. For 2018, the higher amounts of loans and deposits outstanding drove a net increase of $38.1 million in net interest income, while the impact of changes in interest rates resulted in a $4.6 million increase in net interest income.\nIf our nonaccrual and restructured loans as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period (or since origination if held for part of the period), gross interest income in the amounts of approximately $1,763,000, $1,616,000, and $1,503,000 for nonaccrual loans and $662,000, $974,000, and $1,182,000, for restructured loans would have been recorded for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Interest income on such loans that was actually collected and included in net income in 2019, 2018 and 2017 amounted to approximately $759,000, $765,000, and $415,000 for nonaccrual loans (prior to their being placed on nonaccrual status), and $528,000, $763,000, and $885,000 for restructured loans, respectively. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose loans were nonperforming.\nSee additional information regarding net interest income in the section entitled Interest Rate Risk.\u201d\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Management's determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on our level of loan growth, an evaluation of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, historical loan loss experience and other risk factors.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $2.3 million, a negative provision for loan losses of $3.6 million, and a provision for loan losses of $0.7 million, respectively. In 2019, our provision for loan losses was higher than previous years primarily due to higher net charge-offs. The negative provision for 2018 was due primarily to several large loan recoveries realized in the first quarter of 2018 totaling $3.7 million. Although our provision for loan losses was higher in 2019, it continues a trend in recent years of being low compared to historical levels. The low levels of provision for loan losses recorded in recent years were primarily the result of a sustained period of stable and generally improving loan quality trends, which resulted in lower amounts of provision needed to adjust our allowance for loan losses to the appropriate amount. This is driven by our allowance for loan loss model, which utilizes the net charge-offs experienced in the most recent years as a significant component of estimating the current allowance for loan losses that is necessary. Thus, older years (and parts thereof) systematically age out and are excluded from the analysis as time goes on. For the last three years, the new periods being added into our model had generally lower levels of net charge-offs than the older periods rolling out of the model, and thus mostly offset provisions for loan losses that would normally be required to reflect new loan growth and the net charge-offs experienced. Thus, the low level of net charge-offs (or net recoveries) experienced in recent years has been the primary reason for the low (or negative) provisions for loan losses recorded.\nAs shown in Table 14, total net charge-offs (recoveries) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, were $1.9 million, ($1.3 million), and $1.2 million, respectively. The higher net charge-offs in 2019 resulted from lower loan recoveries in comparison to 2018 and 2017.\nIn 2018, we completed a loan sale of approximately $5.2 million in smaller balance nonperforming loans that resulted in loan charge-offs of $2.2 million. However, this was more than offset by full payoffs on four loans received in the first quarter of 2018 that resulted in recoveries to the allowance for loan losses of $3.3 million\nSee Nonperforming Assets\u201d below for further discussion of our asset quality, which impacts our provisions for loan losses.\nThe allowance is monitored and analyzed regularly in conjunction with our loan analysis and grading program, and adjustments are made to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. See the section entitled Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience\u201d below for a more detailed discussion of the allowance for loan losses, including discussion of a change in the way that we will reserve for credit losses beginning in 2020 that may increase the levels and volatility of our provision for loan losses\nNoninterest Income\nOur noninterest income amounted to $59.5 million in 2019, $58.9 million in 2018, and $49.2 million in 2017.\nSee Table 4 and the following discussion for an understanding of the components of noninterest income.\nManagement evaluates noninterest income on a non-GAAP basis that excludes items such as securities gains and losses and other miscellaneous gains and losses. We refer to this as \"adjusted noninterest income.\" Adjusted noninterest income amounted to $59.6 million in 2019, a 2.4% increase from the $58.2 million recorded in 2018. The 2018 adjusted noninterest income of $58.2 million was an 18.6% increase from the $49.1 million recorded in 2017. Comparisons to 2017 for several line items are significantly impacted by our 2017 acquisitions, which resulted in the noninterest income generated by those entities only impacting 2017 for a partial year compared to the full year impact in 2018 and 2019.\nService charges on deposit accounts amounted to $13.0 million, $12.7 million, and $11.9 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We believe the increase in 2019 is primarily due to growth in our number of checking accounts, which we have promoted with new product offerings. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to the aforementioned acquisitions.\nOther service charges, commissions and fees amounted to $19.5 million in 2019, an 18.2% increase from the $16.5 million in 2018. The 2018 amount of $16.5 million was 14.5% higher than the $14.4 million earned in 2017. This category of noninterest income includes items such as interchange fees, ATM charges, safety deposit box rentals, fees from sales of personalized checks, and check cashing fees. The increase in this line item in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to growth in interchange fees that we earn when our customers use their debit and credit cards issued by our bank. Net interchange fees amounted to $13.8 million in 2019 compared to $12.0 million in 2018, an increase of 15.2%. We believe the growth in card usage by our customers is due to customer payment preferences, as well as a result of ongoing promotion of these products. General growth of our bank also contributed to the increase in this line item in 2019. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to the aforementioned acquisitions.\nFees from presold mortgages amounted to $3.9 million in 2019, $2.7 million in 2018, and $5.7 million in 2017. The increase in 2019 was due to increased volumes in the mortgage industry due to declining interest rates, as well as the hiring of additional loan originators. The decline from 2017 to 2018 was due to: i) overall lower volumes in the mortgage industry as a result of higher interest rates, ii) our Mortgage Loan Division originating a higher percentage of loans with construction components that are held in our loan portfolio and not sold, and iii) mortgage origination employees who left the Company in 2018.\nCommissions from sales of insurance and financial products amounted to $8.5 million in 2019, $8.7 million in 2018, and $5.3 million in 2017. This line item includes commissions we receive from two primary sources - 1) commissions from the sales of investment, annuity, and long term care insurance products, and 2) commissions from the sale of property and casualty insurance. The following table presents the contribution of each source to the total amount recognized in this line item:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions earned from:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales of investments, annuities, and long term care insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales of property and casualty insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs can be seen in the above table, sales of property and casualty insurance increased significantly in 2018, which was due to our September 1, 2017 acquisition of Bear Insurance Services (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information). The decline in in this line item in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to lower contingent commissions, which can vary significantly and are impacted by the claims experience of the insurance carriers used by the Company. Sales of investments, annuities and long term care insurance increased in 2018 and 2019 due to the increased growth and promotion of this line of business.\nWe began offering SBA consulting services in 2016 with our May 2016 acquisition of SBA Complete. In this line of business, SBA Complete assists community banks throughout the nation with SBA origination and servicing activities. SBA consulting fees amounted to $3.9 million in 2019, $4.7 million in 2018 and $4.0 million in 2017. The variances among the years are associated with changes in the origination activity of our client banks.\nShortly after the acquisition of SBA Complete, we began a SBA Lending Division, which originates SBA loans throughout the nation and sells the SBA guaranteed portion of those loans, which results in loan sale gains. Loan sale volume can be volatile based on origination activity and the timing of the funding of loans in the pipeline. This division generated $5.5 million in SBA loan sale gains in 2017. In 2018, this division added originators and generated $10.4 million in gains from sales. In 2019, loan sale gains of $8.3 million were realized, with the decline from 2018 being due to the natural volatility discussed above, as well as lower loan sale premiums commanded by the buyers of these loans for much of the year.\nTable 4 shows earnings from bank-owned life insurance income were $2.6 million in 2019, $2.5 million in 2018, and $2.3 million in 2017, with the increases being driven by growth in the underlying life insurance asset.\nSecurities gains of losses were not significant in the years presented, with 2019 having a net gain of $0.1 million, 2018 having no gains or losses, and 2017 having a net loss of $0.2 million.\nOther gains (losses), net\u201d amounted to a net loss of $0.2 million for 2019, a net gain of $0.7 million in 2018, and a net gain of $0.4 million in 2017. This line item represents the net effects of miscellaneous gains and losses that are non-routine in nature. The net gain of $0.7 million in 2018 primarily related to a gain on the sale of a previously closed branch building.\nNoninterest Expenses\nTotal noninterest expenses totaled $157.2 million, $156.5 million, $145.5 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Table 5 presents the components of our noninterest expense during the past three years. Comparisons to 2017 are impacted by our 2017 acquisitions, which resulted in the noninterest expense of those entities only impacting 2017 for a partial year compared to the full year impact in 2018 and 2019.\nTotal personnel expense increased from $92.0 million in 2018 to $96.0 million in 2019, an increase of $4.0 million, or 4.4%. Within personnel expense, salaries expense increased $4.0 million, or 5.4%, while employee benefits expense was approximately the same in 2018 and 2019 at approximately $16.9 million. Salaries expense increased primarily due to normal wage increases for our employees, as well as the hiring of several experienced bankers. Within employee benefits, health care expense, for which the Company is self-insured, is the single largest item and was unchanged in 2019 compared to 2018.\nIn 2018, total personnel expense increased from $82.1 million in 2017 to $92.0 million in 2018, an increase of $9.9 million, or 12.0%. The primary reason for these increase was the aforementioned acquisitions which impacted 2108 for a full year compared to a partial year in 2017. Also, approximately $1.3 million of the increase in personnel expense in 2018 can be attributed to increases in salaries expense related to our SBA lending activities. Also impacting personnel expense in 2018 was an increase in the 401(k) match offered by the Company to employees that was effective January 1, 2018, which increased from a 100% match up to 4% of an employee's salary contribution to a 100% match up to 6% of an employee's salary contribution.\nNet occupancy expenses amounted to $11.1 million in 2019, $10.8 million in 2018, and $9.7 million in 2017. The increase in 2019 is primarily related to increased rent expense associated with several new leases executed during the year. The increases in 2018 were related to the aforementioned acquisitions and expansion initiatives.\nEquipment related expenses amounted to $5.0 million, $5.6 million, and $4.5 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. In 2018, we accelerated $0.3 million in depreciation expense associated with our ATM fleet in anticipation of replacing our ATM's in early 2019. This resulted in a decline in ATM depreciation expense in 2019, as well as lower associated repairs and maintenance costs. In 2018, the increase in this line item related to the aforementioned acquisitions and expansion initiatives.\nMerger and acquisition expenses amounted to $0.2 million in 2019, $2.4 million in 2018, and $8.1 million in 2017. The 2018 amount was primarily comprised of severance costs and data processing conversion expenses related to the acquisition of Asheville Savings Bank. The 2017 amount was primarily comprised of professional fees and severance costs incurred in our acquisitions of Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank.\nIntangible amortization expense amounted to $4.9 million, $5.9 million and $4.0 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase from 2017 to 2018 was due to the addition of $22.5 million in amortizable intangible assets recorded in connection with the 2017 acquisitions of Carolina Bank, Asheville Savings Bank, and Bear Insurance Services. In 2019, intangible amortization expense declined to $4.9 million due to the amortization schedules of those intangible assets generally declining over time.\nFDIC insurance expense amounted to $0.3 million in 2019, $2.3 million in 2018, and $2.4 million in 2017. As discussed previously in the section FDIC Insurance\u201d, in 2019, we received an assessment credit of $1.3 million that was used to offset FDIC insurance expense in the last three quarters of 2019.\nOutside consultant expenses amounted to $1.5 million in 2019, $1.8 million in 2018, $2.5 million in 2017, with 2017 being impacted by consulting expense associated with various operational activities and enhancements.\nData processing expenses did not vary significantly among the periods presented, amounting to $3.1 million $3.2 million, $2.9 million, in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nMarketing expense amounted to $2.7 million in 2019, $3.1 million in 2018, and $2.5 million in 2017. In 2018, we initiated special promotional efforts in our new and expanded market areas.\nNon-credit losses remained relatively unchanged for the periods presented, amounting to $1.0 million in 2019, $1.0 million in 2018, and $0.9 million in 2017. These losses primarily related to debit card and credit card fraud losses.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 6 presents the components of income tax expense and the related effective tax rates. We recorded income tax expense of $24.2 million in 2019, $24.2 million in 2018, and $21.8 million in 2017. Our effective tax rates were 20.8% for 2019, 21.3% for 2018, and 32.1% for 2017. The lower effective rates in 2019 and 2018 compared to 2017 were the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017, which reduced the federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%. At December 31, 2017, we revalued our net deferred tax liability, which reduced income tax expense by $1.3 million for 2017, while in 2018, the new income tax rate of 21% reduced our effective tax rate from 2017.\nAlso, our effective tax rate has been impacted in recent years due lower statutory income tax rates in North Carolina. North Carolina reduced the state income tax rate for corporations from 4.0% in 2017 to 3.0% in 2018 and to 2.5% in 2019, which is where it remains for 2020. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 21.0% in 2020.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recorded stock-based compensation expense of $2.3 million, $1.6 million, and $1.1 million, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increases in this expense have been due to retention-based restricted stock grants made to certain officers during the years presented.

The following table presents detailed information regarding the nature of changes in our loans and deposits in 2018 and 2019.

Loan growth for the periods was organic and primarily driven by our expansion in high-growth markets, hiring of experienced bankers, and increases in SBA lending. We expect continued growth in our loan portfolio for 2020.\nDuring 2019, we experienced an increase in total deposits of $272.0 million, or 5.8%. Within total deposits, we grew our retail deposits (non-brokered deposits) by $426 million, or 9.6%. Within our retail deposits, we experienced growth of $321.9 million, or 8.7%, in checking, money market and savings accounts, and had growth of $106.6 million, or 15.0%, in our retail time deposits. We routinely engage in activities designed to grow and retain deposits, such as (1) emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with us, (2) pricing deposits at rate levels that will attract and/or retain deposits, and (3) continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or\nenhance our appeal as a primary provider of financial services. The high retail deposit growth in 2019 allowed us to reduce our level of brokered deposits by $154 million, or 64.1% during the year. Additionally, we were able to pay down our borrowings in 2019 by $106 million.\nDuring 2018, we experienced an increase in total deposits of $252.4 million, or 5.7%, which was substantially all retail deposit growth. Within our retail deposits, we experienced growth of $186.3 million, or 5.3%, in checking, money market and savings accounts, and had growth of $70.4 million, or 11.0%, in our retail time deposits.\nOur overall liquidity did not vary significantly at December 31, 2019 compared to a year earlier. Our liquid assets (cash and securities) as a percentage of our total deposits and borrowings was 21.4% at December 31, 2019 compared to 21.0% at December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2019, our nonperforming assets to total assets ratio was 0.62% compared to 0.74% at December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to on-going resolution of nonperforming assets and improving credit quality.\nDistribution of Assets and Liabilities\nTable 7 sets forth the percentage relationships of significant components of our balance sheet at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nOur balance sheet mix has remained relatively stable over the past three years. On the asset side, net loans have consistently comprised 72% to 73% of total assets and interest-earning assets have ranged from 88%-90%. In both 2018 and 2019, we used excess cash balances to purchase available for sale securities, which resulted in our mix of securities available for sale increasing from 6% of total assets at year end 2017 to 9% of total assets at the end of 2018 and to 13% of total assets at the end of 2019.\nOn the liability side, deposits have consistently comprised 79% to 80% of total liabilities and shareholders' equity. In 2019, we paid down our borrowings by $106 million, which resulted in our borrowings decreasing to 5% of total liabilities and shareholders' equity from 7% at the two prior year ends.\nShareholders' equity increased from 12% of total liabilities and shareholders' equity at December 31, 2017 to 14% at December 31, 2019 due to increases in retained earnings due to high levels of net income recorded.\nSecurities\nInformation regarding our securities portfolio as of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 is presented in Tables 8 and 9.\nThe composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income. The investment portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds, furnishing liquidity, and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits. We obtain fair values for our investment securities from a third-party investment recordkeeper, who specializes in securities purchases and sales, recordkeeping, and valuation. This recordkeeper provides us with a third-party report that contains an evaluation of internal controls that includes testwork of securities valuation. We further test the values we receive by comparing the values for a significant sample of securities to another third-party valuation service on a quarterly basis.\nTotal securities amounted to $889.9 million, $602.6 million, and $461.8 million at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increase in securities in 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to purchases of fixed rate securities that we initiated to realize higher yields and to protect the Company from expectations of falling interest rates. To fund the purchases, we primarily used interest-bearing cash balances, which earn interest tied to the federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve.\nThe majority of our government-sponsored enterprise\u201d securities carry one maturity date, often with an issuer call feature. At December 31, 2019, of the $20.0 million in available for sale government-sponsored enterprise securities, $15.0 million were issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank system and the remaining $5 million were issued by the Federal Farm Credit Bank system.\nNearly all of our $767.3 million in available for sale mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2019 were issued by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, or the SBA, each of which is a government agency or government-sponsored corporation and guarantees the repayment of the securities. Included in this total are commercial mortgage-backed securities of $262.3 million. Mortgage-backed securities vary in their repayment in correlation with the underlying pools of mortgage loans.\nOur investment policy permits us to hold up to 15% of our securities portfolio in corporate bonds. These bonds have the most credit risk of any of our securities. At December 31, 2019, our $34.7 million investment in corporate bonds was comprised of the following:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Issuer\nRatings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank of America\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A2\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>1/11/2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Citigroup\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa2\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>Various\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goldman Sachs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>1/22/2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>JP Morgan Chase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A2\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>1/25/2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Institutions, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>4/15/2030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wells Fargo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>2/13/2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eagle Bancorp, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>9/1/2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Citizens Bancorp (North Carolina) Trust Preferred Security\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Not Rated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/15/2034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>915\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment in corporate bonds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________________________________\n (1) Ratings issued by Moody's \n (2) Rating issued by Kroll Bond Rating Agency.  We have concluded that any unrealized losses associated with our corporate bonds are due to interest rate considerations and not due to credit concerns.\nAt December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, net unrealized gains (losses) of $9.7 million, ($12.4 million), and ($2.2 million), respectively, were included in the carrying value of securities classified as available for sale. Management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates and the overall economic environment, not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations. Net unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable deferred income taxes, are included as part of a separate component of shareholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income) as of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2019, we held $67.9 million in securities classified as held to maturity, which are carried at amortized cost. These securities had fair values that exceeded their carrying values by $0.4 million December 31, 2019. Approximately $41.4 million of the securities held to maturity are mortgage-backed securities that have been issued by either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. The remaining $26.5 million in securities held to maturity are comprised almost entirely of municipal bonds issued by"}
