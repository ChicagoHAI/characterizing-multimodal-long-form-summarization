interest rate debt outstanding during 2017. Interest expense, net of Interest income increased $13 million in 2016 versus 2015 as interest income decreased year-over-year due to lower interest rates and lower average cash deposits on hand.\nBusiness restructuring\nIn 2016, PPG recorded a pre-tax business restructuring charge of $195 million. During 2017, PPG realized approximately $50 million of cost savings related to restructuring actions. Once fully implemented, the total annual savings run rate is expected to be approximately $125 million. Refer to Note 7, \"Business Restructuring\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nIn 2015, PPG recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $136 million, of which about 85% represented employee severance and other cash charges. As of December 31, 2016, substantially all actions have been completed.\n24 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K\nPension settlements\nDuring 2017, PPG made lump-sum payments to certain retirees who had participated in PPG's U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans totaling approximately $127 million. As the lump-sum payments were in excess of the expected 2017 service and interest costs for the affected plans, PPG remeasured the periodic benefit obligation of these plans in the period payments were made and recorded settlement charges totaling $60 million ($38 million after-tax) during 2017.\nDuring 2016, PPG permanently transferred approximately $1.8 billion of its U.S. and Canadian pension obligations and assets to several highly rated insurance companies. These actions triggered remeasurement and partial settlement of certain of the Company's defined benefit pension plans. PPG recognized a $968 million pre-tax settlement charge in connection with these transactions. Refer to Note 12, \"Employee Benefit Plans\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nOther charges\nOther charges in 2017 were lower than 2016 due to the absence of environmental charges and certain asset write-downs. In 2016, Other charges were higher than in 2015 due to environmental charges of $82 million. These charges were principally for environmental remediation at a former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in New Jersey.\nOther income\nOther income was higher in 2017 than in 2016 primarily due to the gain from the sale of the Mexican Plaka business of $25 million. Other income in 2016 was higher than in 2015 due to gains totaling $46 million resulting from the sale of a PPG legacy U.S. automotive glass and services business and a U.S. business affiliate, higher equity earnings from a 2017 acquisition of a 40% interest in a joint venture and was partially offset by the absence of certain business transaction-related gains.\nEffective tax rate and earnings per diluted share, continuing operations\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183.9%\n</td> <td>(47.5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>30.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>27.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>23.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>3.1%\n</td> <td>3.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted effective tax rate*\n</td> <td>24.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>24.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>23.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.2)%\n</td> <td>0.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per diluted share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$4.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159.5%\n</td> <td>(57.2)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings per diluted share*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5%\n</td> <td>6.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*See the Regulation G reconciliations - results of operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe effective tax rate for the year-ended December 31, 2017 was 30.7% and increased 3.1% from the prior year primarily due to recording the net charge triggered by the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This charge is approximately $37 million higher than the net charge included in PPG's fourth quarter earnings release and Form 8-K furnished on January 18, 2018, primarily due to new IRS regulations issued and refinements of management estimates.\nAs reported, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased year-over-year, primarily due to the absence of the pension settlement charge of $616 million after-tax recorded in 2016. Refer to the Regulation G Reconciliations - Results of Operations for additional information. The Company's earnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per diluted share both benefited from the 7.4 million, 10.7 million and 7.0 million shares of stock repurchased in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nRegulation G Reconciliations - Results of Operations\nPPG Industries believes investors' understanding of the company's operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income, earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate adjusted for certain charges. PPG's management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company's ongoing operating performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations. Net income and earnings per diluted share adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for net income or earnings per diluted share or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, adjusted net income, earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies.\n2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND

Segment income margins expanded, increasing 40 basis points year-over-year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLooking Ahead\nIn the first quarter 2018, we expect sales volumes in the architectural coatings - Americas and Asia Pacific business to be seasonally lower than the fourth quarter 2017. In addition, overall volume trends by customer channel are anticipated to be consistent with the fourth quarter 2017. The PPG TIMELESS\u00ae product, launched in certain HOME DEPOT\u00ae stores in 2017, is projected to continue to meet our sales targets and is being expanded to more locations during 2018. We also anticipate additional growth-related spending of up to $5 million in the first quarter to support the continued momentum in the region. The volume growth trend for architectural coatings - EMEA is expected to improve modestly in the first quarter 2018, with results remaining uneven by country. We expect continued, high end-use demand in our automotive refinish coatings business as customers continue to adopt PPG's industry leading technologies. In aerospace coatings, we anticipate continued improvement in industry demand growth. The protective and marine coatings business is expected to perform in-line with the market in the first quarter 2018.\nWe expect raw material costs to remain elevated in the first-quarter 2018 at similar levels experienced in the fourth quarter. Further selling price increases in 2018 will be needed to offset more recent raw material inflation. There will be no material benefit from acquisition-related sales in the segment, and, based on mid-January exchange rates, foreign currency translation is expected to have a similar sequential favorable impact on segment sales and income in the first quarter 2018.\nDue to the timing of the Easter holiday, there is one fewer ship day in the first-quarter 2018 compared to first-quarter 2017, which is expected to unfavorably impact global architectural coatings sales volumes by about $20 million to $25 million in net sales. This unfavorable impact will reverse in the second quarter.\n28 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K\nIndustrial Coatings\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$6,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$328\n</td> <td>$214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8%\n</td> <td>3.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(70)\n</td> <td>$57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7)%\n</td> <td>5.8%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial Coatings segment net sales increased (6%) due to the following:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25cf Higher sales volumes (+4%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25cf Acquisition-related sales (+3%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Partially offset by:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25cf Lower selling prices (1%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PPG's automotive OEM coatings sales volumes increased by a low-single-digit percentage versus the prior year, consistent with the global automotive industry production growth rate, led by China, Mexico, Europe and Brazil.

In China, automotive production is expected to modestly decrease in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting the expiration of a small engine subsidy that had been in effect the past several years. We anticipate solid general industrial demand growth trends to continue in aggregate, but remain mixed by geography and end-use market. PPG's market outperformance is expected to continue. In our packaging coatings business, we anticipate volume growth will continue due to the ongoing industry conversion to BPA non-intent interior can coatings, with PPG's year-over-year growth rates continuing at an above market level in 2018. We expect acquisition-related sales to add approximately $30 million to first quarter 2018 segment sales and, based on mid-January exchange rates, foreign currency translation is expected to have a similar sequential favorable impact on segment sales and income in the first quarter 2018.\nSegment margin recovery continues to be a priority for 2018. Based on recent raw material inflation, segment margin recovery is expected to continue through the first half of 2018. All businesses in the segment have made progress with selling price initiatives and additional price increases have been announced for early 2018. Also, efforts to reduce costs remain a key focus in 2018.\nReview and Outlook\nDuring 2017, economic conditions improved in all of our major geographical regions while remaining mixed by end-use market. PPG's aggregate organic sales grew 1.5% versus the prior year and were higher in the second half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2017. Acquisition-related sales from two acquisitions completed in 2016 and the four completed in 2017 contributed over 1% to net sales growth year-over-year. Foreign currency translation was modestly favorable to net sales year-over-year. Favorable foreign currency translation experienced in the second half of 2017 slightly offset unfavorable impacts during the first half of the year. Raw material inflation rose by a mid-single-digit percentage driven mostly by supply related factors, including an unusual high number of supplier force majeure events in Europe, government mandated production curtailments in China to help improve pollution, and severe hurricanes in the U.S. In addition, oil prices moved sharply higher in the second half of the year also contributing to raw material inflation.\nU.S. and Canada\nDuring 2017, the pace of economic activity improved in the U.S. and Canada region versus the prior year, with higher industrial production despite lower automotive industry builds. Demand in the residential and commercial construction markets were modestly higher in 2017 compared to 2016. New home starts advanced about 2% in 2017 versus approximately 6% in 2016. Residential remodeling declined 1% in 2017 versus 2016, while commercial construction was flat compared to 7% growth in 2016. Market demand for architectural paint shifted more to trade paint as U.S. unemployment continued to decline. Demand in the overall U.S. DIY paint market remained soft throughout the year. PPG's architectural coatings performance in the U.S. followed market trends with solid improvement in company-owned same store sales throughout the year. The automotive refinish coatings business benefited from higher miles driven and more congestion on the roads due to lower unemployment. PPG's packaging coatings business continued to expand well ahead of the industry end-use market growth driven by continued strong sales growth momentum related to customer adoption of PPG's new interior can coatings technologies. Similar to 2016, PPG's automotive OEM coatings business lagged industry demand levels due to a customer-driven market-share shift away from PPG that was offset in other regions of the world. The U.S. and Canada region remained PPG's largest, representing approximately 43% of 2017 sales, although a smaller percentage of total sales than in the prior year.\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\nEuropean economic activity improved in 2017 despite continued regional uncertainty over the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union. Overall GDP and industrial production improved in the region. Regional demand continued to be mixed by country and end-use market. Demand for PPG's products in several end-use markets drove the regional growth rate, including above market performance in automotive OEM coatings, aerospace coatings and specialty coatings and materials. PPG's architectural coatings - EMEA business sales volumes decreased year-over-year, driven by soft market demand in France and more competitive pressures in Northern and Eastern Europe.\nEMEA represented approximately 30% of PPG's 2017 sales, similar to prior year levels. Regional coatings volumes remain approximately 13% below their pre-recession levels in 2008. The modest volume recovery reflects the slow pace of economic growth in the region. PPG expects continued volume growth over time at attractive incremental margins due to significant cost structure improvements and available capacity to satisfy additional demand. In the second half of the year, the euro appreciated approximately 5% against the U.S. dollar. The British pound recovered some of its 2016 declines versus the U.S. dollar gaining about 10% from the start of 2017.\n30 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K\nAsia Pacific and Latin America\nThe emerging regional markets of Asia Pacific and Latin America represented 27% of PPG's 2017 sales in aggregate, 200 basis points higher than the prior year.\nAsia remained the largest emerging region, with sales of approximately $2.5 billion, led by China, which continued as PPG's second largest country by revenue. Sales volume growth in Asia was led by the Industrial Coatings segment, in part due to strong sales volume growth in general industrial and automotive OEM. These increases were partially offset by the continued demand decline in the marine shipbuilding industry.\nOverall, demand in Latin America improved year-over-year, with continued above market growth in Mexico and Central America. Economic conditions modestly improved in South America, primarily led by Brazil. In Mexico, the PPG-Comex business added over 200 new concessionaire locations, and strong growth continued in the automotive industry due to the opening of new automotive assembly plants within the country in the past 18 months. Foreign currency translation turned favorable in the second half of the year, principally the Mexican peso and Chinese yuan. In Central America, the Company continued to grow organically following a 2015 acquisition to expand its presence in the architectural end-use market.\nRegional Outlook\nLooking ahead to 2018, we expect to continue to operate in a more balanced global growth environment. We anticipate the positive economic trends in 2017 to mostly continue. We expect economic growth rates to remain consistent with 2017 for the U.S. and Canada, Europe, and Asia Pacific regions, and we expect the Latin America region will increase its economic growth year-over-year, when compared to 2017.\nWe anticipate PPG's U.S. and Canada regional growth will be led by general industrial coatings and packaging coatings, with flat automotive industry builds. We expect growth in the housing and commercial construction markets to be better than 2017.\nWe expect growth rates in Europe to stay at similar levels as 2017 but will remain mixed by sub-region and country. Favorable end-use market trends are expected to continue, particularly in automotive OEM coatings as industry build growth rates are anticipated to remain positive. Market demand is expected to improve in the architectural coatings business. There is greater risk to the economic environment in the U.K. as their exit from the European Union progresses.\nIn Asia Pacific, we expect continued industrial production growth in China as well as gains in Southeast Asia and India. In China, we see continued above global average growth with heightened risk as the Chinese economy continues to shift and rely more on domestic consumption. The regional declines in marine coatings sales volumes were less severe in the second half of 2017, and we expect a moderate recovery in sales volumes starting in the second half of 2018. Automotive build growth is expected to remain modestly positive.\nIn Latin America, we anticipate economic expansion will be led by Brazil and that Mexico's economic conditions will modestly improve.\nSignificant other factors\nDuring 2017, PPG finalized the divestiture of its North American fiber glass business. This is a transformational milestone for the Company as it completed the culmination of a multi-year strategic shift in the company's business portfolio. The pre-tax cash proceeds from the sale were approximately $540 million.\nIn December 2016, PPG initiated a $195 million global restructuring program, with anticipated annual savings of approximately $125 million once fully implemented. The expected cost savings are broadly spread across all regions and all business units. The company achieved approximately $50 million of savings in 2017 and expects to achieve the full annualized target of $125 million by 2019. PPG will continue to aggressively manage the company's cost structure to ensure alignment with the overall demand environment and make adjustments as required to remain competitive in the marketplace.\nRaw materials are a significant input cost to the process of manufacturing coatings. PPG experiences fluctuating energy and raw material costs driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, and global supply and demand factors. In aggregate, average raw material costs were higher in 2017 versus 2016, due to supplier force majeure, natural disasters and environmental regulation enforcement. PPG currently expects overall coatings raw material prices to increase a mid-single-digit percentage in the first half of 2018, with impacts varied by region and commodity.\nIn 2017, aggregate selling prices were modestly higher year-over-year, reflecting the company's efforts to offset higher raw material costs. We expect to see further benefits from selling price actions taken in 2017 and other actions planned in 2018 to recover profit contribution margins. The Company will carefully monitor raw material costs during 2018 and assess the need for additional increases to selling prices to compensate for increases in raw material costs.\n2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 31\nPension and postretirement benefit costs, excluding settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits, totaled approximately $50 million in 2017, down approximately $70 million from 2016. In 2018, we expect pension and other postretirement benefit costs to decrease by approximately $15 million to $20 million due to strong 2017 asset performance improving the expected return on assets component of net periodic benefit cost as well as certain U.S. plan changes made in 2017.\nPPG contributed $54 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2017 and an additional $25 million in January 2018. In 2017, the Company made contributions aggregating $33 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In 2018, mandatory contributions to PPG's non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be between $20 million and $30 million.\nIn 2017, unfavorable foreign currency translation experienced in the first half was completely offset by favorable foreign currency translation experienced in the second half of the year. Based on mid-January 2018 exchange rates, the Company expects year-over-year favorable foreign currency translation to increase 2018 sales by $250 million to $300 million and 2018 income before income taxes by $25 million to $30 million. We expect the foreign currency translation impact to be more prevalent during the first half of 2018, due to prior year foreign exchange rate trends. The foreign currency environment continues to be volatile and the impact on 2018 net sales and income before income taxes could differ from the guidance provided above. The Company generally purchases raw materials, incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in the same currency, so we typically incur only modest foreign currency transaction costs.\nWith the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company's 2018 effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 23.0% and 24.0%. This range represents the Company's best estimate, including the new legislation, however, our estimate is subject to revision as the Company completes its assessment of the new law and as additional regulations and interpretations are issued. Other factors may affect the expected 2018 effective tax rate positively or negatively throughout the year, including changes to various statutory tax rates and regulations around the world.\nOver the past four years, the Company used $3.4 billion of cash to repurchase about 33 million shares of PPG stock, including over $800 million in 2017. The Company ended the year with approximately $3.6 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorizations. During 2017, the Company deployed approximately $325 million for acquisitions and $434 million for dividends. PPG increased its per-share dividend in July 2017, marking the 46th annual increase and the 118th consecutive year of dividend payments. The Company is committed to deploying a minimum of $2.4 billion of cash during 2018 on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of our previously communicated commitment to deploy $3.5 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined. In 2017, PPG deployed $1.1 million for acquisitions and share repurchases.\nPPG ended 2017 with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. The Company expects continued strong cash generation in 2018.\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2017\nNote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the Company's recently adopted accounting pronouncements.\nAccounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Years\nNote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes accounting pronouncements that have been promulgated prior to December 31, 2017 but are not effective until a future date.\nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities, including Environmental Matters\nPPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and Note 13, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of certain of these lawsuits.\nAs discussed in Item 3 and Note 13, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including asbestos-related claims, will not have a material effect on PPG's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.\nIt is PPG's policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. In management's opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the Company's environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on PPG's financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. Management anticipates that the resolution of the Company's environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time.\n32 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K\nThe Company continues to analyze, assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with PPG's former chromium manufacturing plant in Jersey City, N.J. and associated sites ( New Jersey Chrome\u201d). Information will continue to be generated from the ongoing groundwater remedial investigation activities related to New Jersey Chrome and will be incorporated into a final draft remedial action work plan for groundwater expected to be submitted to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 2021.\nThere are multiple, future events yet to occur, including further remedy selection and design, remedy implementation and execution and applicable governmental agency or community organization approvals. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding the timing of these future events for the New Jersey Chrome sites. Final resolution of these events is expected to occur over the next several years. As these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation remedies change, the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will be adjusted.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the past three years, PPG has had sufficient financial resources to meet its operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, including acquisitions, share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to shareholders.\nCash and cash equivalents and short-term investments\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash from operating activities - continuing operations\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash from operating activities\n</td> <td>$1,556\n</td> <td>$1,218\n</td> <td>$1,759\n</td> <td>27.8%\n</td> <td>(30.8)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 vs. 2016\nThe $338 million increase in cash from operating activities - continuing operations, was primarily due to the absence of the prior year funding of the Pittsburgh Corning asbestos trust (the Trust\u201d), lower defined benefit pension contributions, lower restructuring payments and lower interest payments, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid in 2017 and higher working capital.\n2016 vs. 2015\nThe $541 million decrease in cash from operating activities - continuing operations, was primarily due to the after-tax funding of the Trust, partially offset by lower working capital and lower defined benefit pension contributions.\nOperating working capital\nOperating Working Capital is a subset of total working capital and represents (1) receivables from customers, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, (2) inventories, and (3) trade liabilities. See Note 3, Working Capital Detail\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information related to the components of the Company's Operating Working Capital. We believe Operating Working Capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses.\nA key metric we use to measure our working capital management is Operating Working Capital as a percentage of sales (fourth quarter sales annualized).\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade Receivables, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories, FIFO\n</td> <td>1,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade Creditor's Liabilities\n</td> <td>2,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Working Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Working Capital as a % of fourth quarter sales, annualized\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade Receivables, net as a % of fourth quarter sales, annualized\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Days sales outstanding\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories, FIFO as a % of fourth quarter sales, annualized\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory turnover\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 33\nEnvironmental expenditures\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash outlays related to environmental remediation activities\n</td> <td>$44\n</td> <td>$47\n</td> <td>$109\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect cash outlays for environmental remediation activities in 2018 to be between $25 million and $75 million.\nDefined benefit pension plan contributions Table 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. defined benefit pension plans\n</td> <td>$54\n</td> <td>$134\n</td> <td>$224\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans\n</td> <td>$33\n</td> <td>$54\n</td> <td>$39\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPPG contributed $54 million and $25 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans during 2017 and in January 2018, respectively.

PPG expects to make mandatory contributions to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in the range of $20 million to $30 million in 2018. PPG may make voluntary contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2018 and beyond.\nAsbestos settlement trust funding\nIn June 2016, PPG fully funded its portion of the trust that was established by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in May 2016. PPG's total cash obligations to fund the Trust totaled $813 million (pre-tax). All payments were applied against a previously established PPG reserve for the total asbestos trust obligation. The company utilized cash on hand for the payments, and this funding had no impact on PPG's previously stated cash-deployment targets.

The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.8 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement will terminate on December 18, 2020. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under the existing or the prior Credit Agreement.\nIn addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit, the Company has an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC pursuant to which it may issue, offer and sell from time to time on a continuous or delayed basis any combination of securities in one or more offerings.\nSee Note 8, Borrowings and Lines of Credit,\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding notes entered into and repaid as well as details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit, guarantees and debt covenants.\nContractual obligations\nWe continue to believe that our cash on hand and short term investments, cash from operations and the Company's access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital spending, acquisitions, dividend payments, debt service, share repurchases, contributions to pension plans, and PPG's significant contractual obligations.

In December 2017, the Company recorded a net tax charge of $134 million related to the Act. The net charge consists of the tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings of approximately $250 million and a charge of approximately $125 million related to the remeasurement of PPG's U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new enacted statutory rate. These charges were partially offset by a benefit from the reversal of an existing deferred tax liability on repatriated foreign earnings of approximately $150 million and a benefit resulting from PPG's decision to accelerate recognition of certain U.S. tax attributes during the fourth quarter.\nThis net charge is $37 million higher than the net charge included in PPG's fourth quarter earnings release and Form 8-K furnished on January 18, 2018, primarily due to new IRS regulations issued and refinements of management estimates. The net charge recorded as a provisional amount as of December 31, 2017 represents the Company's best estimate using information available as of February 1, 2018. The Company anticipates U.S. regulatory agencies will issue further regulations during 2018, which may alter this estimate. The Company is still evaluating among other things, its position with respect to permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings overseas and other related outside basis difference considerations and the amount of tax owed on unrepatriated earnings by subsidiaries. The Company believes its remeasurement of the U.S deferred tax assets and liabilities is complete, except for changes in estimates that can result from finalizing the filing of our 2017 U.S.\n36 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K\nincome tax return, which are not anticipated to be material, and changes that may be a direct impact of other provisional amounts recorded due to the enactment of the Act. The Company will refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it comes available through the filing date of its 2017 U.S. income tax returns in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe tax owed by PPG on its unrepatriated foreign earnings is payable over eight years and is subject to a prescriptive calculation to determine the portion payable in 2018 and beyond. PPG's current estimate, using this prescriptive method, indicates its tax payable will be increased by approximately $1 million to $3 million per year through 2025. As such, the portion of the tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings not payable within the next 12 months is presented within Other liabilities\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe Company currently expects its 2018 on-going effective tax rate from continuing operations to be in the range of 23% to 24%.\nAt December 31, 2017, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was $163 million. The timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities. PPG does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year. The Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company's off-balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in Note 8, Borrowings and Lines of Credit,\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nManagement has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under Item 8 of this Form 10-K and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. We believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.\nContingencies\nContingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. The most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectability of accounts receivable, to environmental remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the Company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years. For more information on these matters, see Note 3, Working Capital Detail,\u201d Note 11, Income Taxes\u201d and Note 13, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nDefined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nAccounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. To accomplish this, we make extensive use of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. The Company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually. See Note 12, Employee Benefit Plans,\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information on these plans and the assumptions used.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations, the Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill. The valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. In addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts, the Company uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; third-party actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations; and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental and other contingent liabilities. The business and technical judgment of management was used in determining which intangible assets have indefinite lives and in\n2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 37\ndetermining the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount. Fair values under the quantitative test are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows. For more information on these matters, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nWe believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate PPG management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates.\nCurrency\nComparing exchange rates from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, the U.S. dollar weakened against the currencies in most countries in which PPG operates, most notably the Mexican peso, British pound, Chinese yuan and euro. As a result, consolidated net assets at December 31, 2017 increased by approximately $231 million from December 31, 2016.\nComparing exchange rates from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the currencies in most countries in which PPG operates, most notably the Mexican peso, British pound, Chinese yuan and euro. As a result, consolidated net assets at December 31, 2016 decreased by approximately $465 million from December 31, 2015.\nComparing exchange rates during 2017 to those of 2016, in the countries in which PPG operates, the U.S. dollar was stronger overall, which had an unfavorable impact of approximately $7 million on full year 2017 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into U.S. dollars.\nComparing exchange rates during 2016 to those of 2015, in the countries in which PPG operates, the U.S. dollar was stronger overall, which had an unfavorable impact of approximately $70 million on full year 2016 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into U.S. dollars.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Management's Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views with respect to future events and financial performance.\nYou can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts. Forward-looking statements are identified by the use of the words aim,\u201d believe,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d intend,\u201d estimate,\u201d project,\u201d outlook,\u201d forecast\u201d and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also, note the following cautionary statements.\nMany factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's forward-looking statements. Such factors include the impacts of the natural disasters in Mexico, Puerto Rico and the U.S., and their length and severity, any currently unanticipated future impacts from the natural disasters, global economic conditions, increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to increase selling price, the ability to recover margins, our ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the timing of and the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in the markets we serve, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.\nConsequently, while the list of factors presented here and under Item 1A is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements.\n38 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K\nConsequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, lower sales or income, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties, other factors set forth in Item 1A of this Form 10-K and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to understand the table you've provided me with.\n- It seems to be missing some information in certain cells, and I cannot properly interpret the table without that information.\n- Could you please provide me with the missing information so I can complete the table for you?\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions regarding this table or anything else!", "item_7_tables": "Table 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States and Canada\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$6,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$6,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$6,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9%\n</td> <td>0.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA)\n</td> <td>4,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4%\n</td> <td>1.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>2,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8%\n</td> <td>(0.1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America\n</td> <td>1,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6%\n</td> <td>(3.5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$14,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$14,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$14,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4%\n</td> <td>0.2%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>Table 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales increased $480 million due to the following:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25cf Acquisition-related sales (+1%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25cf Higher sales volumes (+1%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25cf Slightly favorable foreign currency translation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25cf Slightly higher selling prices\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales from acquired businesses, net of divestitures, added over $200 million of sales in 2017, primarily MetoKote, DEUTEK, Univer and The Crown Group.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. and Canada sales volumes declined slightly year-over-year, with mixed demand by business and end-use market segment.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nPerformance Overview\nNet Sales\n\n\n22 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K\n\nCost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\n\n\n\n2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 23\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n\n\n\nOther charges and other income \nInterest expense, net of Interest income\nInterest expense, net of interest income decreased $14 million in 2017 versus 2016 primarily due to lower interest rate debt outstanding during 2017. Interest expense, net of Interest income increased $13 million in 2016 versus 2015 as interest income decreased year-over-year due to lower interest rates and lower average cash deposits on hand.\nBusiness restructuring\nIn 2016, PPG recorded a pre-tax business restructuring charge of $195 million. During 2017, PPG realized approximately $50 million of cost savings related to restructuring actions. Once fully implemented, the total annual savings run rate is expected to be approximately $125 million. Refer to Note 7, \"Business Restructuring\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nIn 2015, PPG recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $136 million, of which about 85% represented employee severance and other cash charges. As of December 31, 2016, substantially all actions have been completed.\n24 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K\nPension settlements\nDuring 2017, PPG made lump-sum payments to certain retirees who had participated in PPG's U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans totaling approximately $127 million. As the lump-sum payments were in excess of the expected 2017 service and interest costs for the affected plans, PPG remeasured the periodic benefit obligation of these plans in the period payments were made and recorded settlement charges totaling $60 million ($38 million after-tax) during 2017.\nDuring 2016, PPG permanently transferred approximately $1.8 billion of its U.S. and Canadian pension obligations and assets to several highly rated insurance companies. These actions triggered remeasurement and partial settlement of certain of the Company's defined benefit pension plans. PPG recognized a $968 million pre-tax settlement charge in connection with these transactions. Refer to Note 12, \"Employee Benefit Plans\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nOther charges\nOther charges in 2017 were lower than 2016 due to the absence of environmental charges and certain asset write-downs. In 2016, Other charges were higher than in 2015 due to environmental charges of $82 million. These charges were principally for environmental remediation at a former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in New Jersey.\nOther income\nOther income was higher in 2017 than in 2016 primarily due to the gain from the sale of the Mexican Plaka business of $25 million. Other income in 2016 was higher than in 2015 due to gains totaling $46 million resulting from the sale of a PPG legacy U.S. automotive glass and services business and a U.S. business affiliate, higher equity earnings from a 2017 acquisition of a 40% interest in a joint venture and was partially offset by the absence of certain business transaction-related gains.\nEffective tax rate and earnings per diluted share, continuing operations\n\nThe effective tax rate for the year-ended December 31, 2017 was 30.7% and increased 3.1% from the prior year primarily due to recording the net charge triggered by the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This charge is approximately $37 million higher than the net charge included in PPG's fourth quarter earnings release and Form 8-K furnished on January 18, 2018, primarily due to new IRS regulations issued and refinements of management estimates.\nAs reported, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased year-over-year, primarily due to the absence of the pension settlement charge of $616 million after-tax recorded in 2016. Refer to the Regulation G Reconciliations - Results of Operations for additional information. The Company's earnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per diluted share both benefited from the 7.4 million, 10.7 million and 7.0 million shares of stock repurchased in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nRegulation G Reconciliations - Results of Operations\nPPG Industries believes investors' understanding of the company's operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income, earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate adjusted for certain charges. PPG's management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company's ongoing operating performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations. Net income and earnings per diluted share adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for net income or earnings per diluted share or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, adjusted net income, earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies.\n2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 25\nIncome before income taxes is reconciled to adjusted income before income taxes, the effective tax rate from continuing operations is reconciled to the adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations and net income (attributable to PPG) and earnings per share - assuming dilution (attributable to PPG) are reconciled to adjusted net income (attributable to PPG) and adjusted earnings per share - assuming dilution below:\n\n\n\n (1) Transaction-related costs include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees incurred to effect significant acquisitions, as well as similar fees and other costs to effect divestitures not classified as discontinued operations. These costs also include the flow-through cost of sales impact for the step up to fair value of inventory acquired in acquisitions. These costs also include certain nonrecurring severance costs and charges associated with the Company's business portfolio transformation. \n26 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K\nPerformance of Reportable Business Segments\nPerformance Coatings\n\n\n2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 27\n\nLooking Ahead\nIn the first quarter 2018, we expect sales volumes in the architectural coatings - Americas and Asia Pacific business to be seasonally lower than the fourth quarter 2017. In addition, overall volume trends by customer channel are anticipated to be consistent with the fourth quarter 2017. The PPG TIMELESS\u00ae product, launched in certain HOME DEPOT\u00ae stores in 2017, is projected to continue to meet our sales targets and is being expanded to more locations during 2018. We also anticipate additional growth-related spending of up to $5 million in the first quarter to support the continued momentum in the region. The volume growth trend for architectural coatings - EMEA is expected to improve modestly in the first quarter 2018, with results remaining uneven by country. We expect continued, high end-use demand in our automotive refinish coatings business as customers continue to adopt PPG's industry leading technologies. In aerospace coatings, we anticipate continued improvement in industry demand growth. The protective and marine coatings business is expected to perform in-line with the market in the first quarter 2018.\nWe expect raw material costs to remain elevated in the first-quarter 2018 at similar levels experienced in the fourth quarter. Further selling price increases in 2018 will be needed to offset more recent raw material inflation. There will be no material benefit from acquisition-related sales in the segment, and, based on mid-January exchange rates, foreign currency translation is expected to have a similar sequential favorable impact on segment sales and income in the first quarter 2018.\nDue to the timing of the Easter holiday, there is one fewer ship day in the first-quarter 2018 compared to first-quarter 2017, which is expected to unfavorably impact global architectural coatings sales volumes by about $20 million to $25 million in net sales. This unfavorable impact will reverse in the second quarter.\n28 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K\nIndustrial Coatings\n\n\n\n2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 29\nLooking ahead\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we expect global automotive industry production growth to be about 1% led by Europe and Mexico. In China, automotive production is expected to modestly decrease in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting the expiration of a small engine subsidy that had been in effect the past several years. We anticipate solid general industrial demand growth trends to continue in aggregate, but remain mixed by geography and end-use market. PPG's market outperformance is expected to continue. In our packaging coatings business, we anticipate volume growth will continue due to the ongoing industry conversion to BPA non-intent interior can coatings, with PPG's year-over-year growth rates continuing at an above market level in 2018. We expect acquisition-related sales to add approximately $30 million to first quarter 2018 segment sales and, based on mid-January exchange rates, foreign currency translation is expected to have a similar sequential favorable impact on segment sales and income in the first quarter 2018.\nSegment margin recovery continues to be a priority for 2018. Based on recent raw material inflation, segment margin recovery is expected to continue through the first half of 2018. All businesses in the segment have made progress with selling price initiatives and additional price increases have been announced for early 2018. Also, efforts to reduce costs remain a key focus in 2018.\nReview and Outlook\nDuring 2017, economic conditions improved in all of our major geographical regions while remaining mixed by end-use market. PPG's aggregate organic sales grew 1.5% versus the prior year and were higher in the second half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2017. Acquisition-related sales from two acquisitions completed in 2016 and the four completed in 2017 contributed over 1% to net sales growth year-over-year. Foreign currency translation was modestly favorable to net sales year-over-year. Favorable foreign currency translation experienced in the second half of 2017 slightly offset unfavorable impacts during the first half of the year. Raw material inflation rose by a mid-single-digit percentage driven mostly by supply related factors, including an unusual high number of supplier force majeure events in Europe, government mandated production curtailments in China to help improve pollution, and severe hurricanes in the U.S. In addition, oil prices moved sharply higher in the second half of the year also contributing to raw material inflation.\nU.S. and Canada\nDuring 2017, the pace of economic activity improved in the U.S. and Canada region versus the prior year, with higher industrial production despite lower automotive industry builds. Demand in the residential and commercial construction markets were modestly higher in 2017 compared to 2016. New home starts advanced about 2% in 2017 versus approximately 6% in 2016. Residential remodeling declined 1% in 2017 versus 2016, while commercial construction was flat compared to 7% growth in 2016. Market demand for architectural paint shifted more to trade paint as U.S. unemployment continued to decline. Demand in the overall U.S. DIY paint market remained soft throughout the year. PPG's architectural coatings performance in the U.S. followed market trends with solid improvement in company-owned same store sales throughout the year. The automotive refinish coatings business benefited from higher miles driven and more congestion on the roads due to lower unemployment. PPG's packaging coatings business continued to expand well ahead of the industry end-use market growth driven by continued strong sales growth momentum related to customer adoption of PPG's new interior can coatings technologies. Similar to 2016, PPG's automotive OEM coatings business lagged industry demand levels due to a customer-driven market-share shift away from PPG that was offset in other regions of the world. The U.S. and Canada region remained PPG's largest, representing approximately 43% of 2017 sales, although a smaller percentage of total sales than in the prior year.\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\nEuropean economic activity improved in 2017 despite continued regional uncertainty over the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union. Overall GDP and industrial production improved in the region. Regional demand continued to be mixed by country and end-use market. Demand for PPG's products in several end-use markets drove the regional growth rate, including above market performance in automotive OEM coatings, aerospace coatings and specialty coatings and materials. PPG's architectural coatings - EMEA business sales volumes decreased year-over-year, driven by soft market demand in France and more competitive pressures in Northern and Eastern Europe.\nEMEA represented approximately 30% of PPG's 2017 sales, similar to prior year levels. Regional coatings volumes remain approximately 13% below their pre-recession levels in 2008. The modest volume recovery reflects the slow pace of economic growth in the region. PPG expects continued volume growth over time at attractive incremental margins due to significant cost structure improvements and available capacity to satisfy additional demand. In the second half of the year, the euro appreciated approximately 5% against the U.S. dollar. The British pound recovered some of its 2016 declines versus the U.S. dollar gaining about 10% from the start of 2017.\n30 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K\nAsia Pacific and Latin America\nThe emerging regional markets of Asia Pacific and Latin America represented 27% of PPG's 2017 sales in aggregate, 200 basis points higher than the prior year.\nAsia remained the largest emerging region, with sales of approximately $2.5 billion, led by China, which continued as PPG's second largest country by revenue. Sales volume growth in Asia was led by the Industrial Coatings segment, in part due to strong sales volume growth in general industrial and automotive OEM. These increases were partially offset by the continued demand decline in the marine shipbuilding industry.\nOverall, demand in Latin America improved year-over-year, with continued above market growth in Mexico and Central America. Economic conditions modestly improved in South America, primarily led by Brazil. In Mexico, the PPG-Comex business added over 200 new concessionaire locations, and strong growth continued in the automotive industry due to the opening of new automotive assembly plants within the country in the past 18 months. Foreign currency translation turned favorable in the second half of the year, principally the Mexican peso and Chinese yuan. In Central America, the Company continued to grow organically following a 2015 acquisition to expand its presence in the architectural end-use market.\nRegional Outlook\nLooking ahead to 2018, we expect to continue to operate in a more balanced global growth environment. We anticipate the positive economic trends in 2017 to mostly continue. We expect economic growth rates to remain consistent with 2017 for the U.S. and Canada, Europe, and Asia Pacific regions, and we expect the Latin America region will increase its economic growth year-over-year, when compared to 2017.\nWe anticipate PPG's U.S. and Canada regional growth will be led by general industrial coatings and packaging coatings, with flat automotive industry builds. We expect growth in the housing and commercial construction markets to be better than 2017.\nWe expect growth rates in Europe to stay at similar levels as 2017 but will remain mixed by sub-region and country. Favorable end-use market trends are expected to continue, particularly in automotive OEM coatings as industry build growth rates are anticipated to remain positive. Market demand is expected to improve in the architectural coatings business. There is greater risk to the economic environment in the U.K. as their exit from the European Union progresses.\nIn Asia Pacific, we expect continued industrial production growth in China as well as gains in Southeast Asia and India. In China, we see continued above global average growth with heightened risk as the Chinese economy continues to shift and rely more on domestic consumption. The regional declines in marine coatings sales volumes were less severe in the second half of 2017, and we expect a moderate recovery in sales volumes starting in the second half of 2018. Automotive build growth is expected to remain modestly positive.\nIn Latin America, we anticipate economic expansion will be led by Brazil and that Mexico's economic conditions will modestly improve.\nSignificant other factors\nDuring 2017, PPG finalized the divestiture of its North American fiber glass business. This is a transformational milestone for the Company as it completed the culmination of a multi-year strategic shift in the company's business portfolio. The pre-tax cash proceeds from the sale were approximately $540 million.\nIn December 2016, PPG initiated a $195 million global restructuring program, with anticipated annual savings of approximately $125 million once fully implemented. The expected cost savings are broadly spread across all regions and all business units. The company achieved approximately $50 million of savings in 2017 and expects to achieve the full annualized target of $125 million by 2019. PPG will continue to aggressively manage the company's cost structure to ensure alignment with the overall demand environment and make adjustments as required to remain competitive in the marketplace.\nRaw materials are a significant input cost to the process of manufacturing coatings. PPG experiences fluctuating energy and raw material costs driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, and global supply and demand factors. In aggregate, average raw material costs were higher in 2017 versus 2016, due to supplier force majeure, natural disasters and environmental regulation enforcement. PPG currently expects overall coatings raw material prices to increase a mid-single-digit percentage in the first half of 2018, with impacts varied by region and commodity.\nIn 2017, aggregate selling prices were modestly higher year-over-year, reflecting the company's efforts to offset higher raw material costs. We expect to see further benefits from selling price actions taken in 2017 and other actions planned in 2018 to recover profit contribution margins. The Company will carefully monitor raw material costs during 2018 and assess the need for additional increases to selling prices to compensate for increases in raw material costs.\n2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 31\nPension and postretirement benefit costs, excluding settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits, totaled approximately $50 million in 2017, down approximately $70 million from 2016. In 2018, we expect pension and other postretirement benefit costs to decrease by approximately $15 million to $20 million due to strong 2017 asset performance improving the expected return on assets component of net periodic benefit cost as well as certain U.S. plan changes made in 2017.\nPPG contributed $54 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2017 and an additional $25 million in January 2018. In 2017, the Company made contributions aggregating $33 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In 2018, mandatory contributions to PPG's non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be between $20 million and $30 million.\nIn 2017, unfavorable foreign currency translation experienced in the first half was completely offset by favorable foreign currency translation experienced in the second half of the year. Based on mid-January 2018 exchange rates, the Company expects year-over-year favorable foreign currency translation to increase 2018 sales by $250 million to $300 million and 2018 income before income taxes by $25 million to $30 million. We expect the foreign currency translation impact to be more prevalent during the first half of 2018, due to prior year foreign exchange rate trends. The foreign currency environment continues to be volatile and the impact on 2018 net sales and income before income taxes could differ from the guidance provided above. The Company generally purchases raw materials, incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in the same currency, so we typically incur only modest foreign currency transaction costs.\nWith the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company's 2018 effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 23.0% and 24.0%. This range represents the Company's best estimate, including the new legislation, however, our estimate is subject to revision as the Company completes its assessment of the new law and as additional regulations and interpretations are issued. Other factors may affect the expected 2018 effective tax rate positively or negatively throughout the year, including changes to various statutory tax rates and regulations around the world.\nOver the past four years, the Company used $3.4 billion of cash to repurchase about 33 million shares of PPG stock, including over $800 million in 2017. The Company ended the year with approximately $3.6 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorizations. During 2017, the Company deployed approximately $325 million for acquisitions and $434 million for dividends. PPG increased its per-share dividend in July 2017, marking the 46th annual increase and the 118th consecutive year of dividend payments. The Company is committed to deploying a minimum of $2.4 billion of cash during 2018 on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of our previously communicated commitment to deploy $3.5 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined. In 2017, PPG deployed $1.1 million for acquisitions and share repurchases.\nPPG ended 2017 with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. The Company expects continued strong cash generation in 2018.\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2017\nNote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the Company's recently adopted accounting pronouncements.\nAccounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Years\nNote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes accounting pronouncements that have been promulgated prior to December 31, 2017 but are not effective until a future date.\nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities, including Environmental Matters\nPPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and Note 13, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of certain of these lawsuits.\nAs discussed in Item 3 and Note 13, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including asbestos-related claims, will not have a material effect on PPG's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.\nIt is PPG's policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. In management's opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the Company's environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on PPG's financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. Management anticipates that the resolution of the Company's environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time.\n32 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K\nThe Company continues to analyze, assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with PPG's former chromium manufacturing plant in Jersey City, N.J. and associated sites ( New Jersey Chrome\u201d). Information will continue to be generated from the ongoing groundwater remedial investigation activities related to New Jersey Chrome and will be incorporated into a final draft remedial action work plan for groundwater expected to be submitted to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 2021.\nThere are multiple, future events yet to occur, including further remedy selection and design, remedy implementation and execution and applicable governmental agency or community organization approvals. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding the timing of these future events for the New Jersey Chrome sites. Final resolution of these events is expected to occur over the next several years. As these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation remedies change, the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will be adjusted.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the past three years, PPG has had sufficient financial resources to meet its operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, including acquisitions, share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to shareholders.\nCash and cash equivalents and short-term investments\n\nCash from operating activities - continuing operations\n\n2017 vs. 2016\nThe $338 million increase in cash from operating activities - continuing operations, was primarily due to the absence of the prior year funding of the Pittsburgh Corning asbestos trust (the Trust\u201d), lower defined benefit pension contributions, lower restructuring payments and lower interest payments, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid in 2017 and higher working capital.\n2016 vs. 2015\nThe $541 million decrease in cash from operating activities - continuing operations, was primarily due to the after-tax funding of the Trust, partially offset by lower working capital and lower defined benefit pension contributions.\nOperating working capital\nOperating Working Capital is a subset of total working capital and represents (1) receivables from customers, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, (2) inventories, and (3) trade liabilities. See Note 3, Working Capital Detail\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information related to the components of the Company's Operating Working Capital. We believe Operating Working Capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses.\nA key metric we use to measure our working capital management is Operating Working Capital as a percentage of sales (fourth quarter sales annualized).\n\n2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 33\nEnvironmental expenditures\n\nWe expect cash outlays for environmental remediation activities in 2018 to be between $25 million and $75 million.\nDefined benefit pension plan contributions \nPPG contributed $54 million and $25 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans during 2017 and in January 2018, respectively. Some contributions to PPG's non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2017 were required by local funding requirements. PPG expects to make mandatory contributions to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in the range of $20 million to $30 million in 2018. PPG may make voluntary contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2018 and beyond.\nAsbestos settlement trust funding\nIn June 2016, PPG fully funded its portion of the trust that was established by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in May 2016. PPG's total cash obligations to fund the Trust totaled $813 million (pre-tax). All payments were applied against a previously established PPG reserve for the total asbestos trust obligation. The company utilized cash on hand for the payments, and this funding had no impact on PPG's previously stated cash-deployment targets. Refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nCash used for investing activities - continuing operations\n\n2017 vs. 2016\nThe $535 million decrease in cash used for investing activities - continuing operations, was primarily due to the absence of the prior year proceeds from the sale of the flat glass business, European fiber glass business and two Asian joint ventures, as well as lower capital expenditures, including business acquisitions, partially offset by the current year proceeds from the sale of the North American fiber glass business.\n2016 vs. 2015\nThe $821 million increase in cash from investing activities - continuing operations, was primarily due to the proceeds received from the divestiture of the flat glass business, European fiber glass business and two Asian joint ventures, partially offset by lower cash received from the maturity of short-term investments.\nCapital expenditures, including business acquisitions\n\n(1) Includes modernization and productivity improvements, expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects.\n(2) Excluding cash acquired, business acquisitions totaled $332 million, $362 million, and $440 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCapital expenditures related to modernization and productivity improvements, expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects is expected to be in the range of 2.5% to 3.0% of sales during 2018.\nA primary focus for the Company in 2018 will continue to be cash deployment focused on profitable income growth, including pursuing opportunities for additional strategic acquisitions.\n34 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K\nCash proceeds from divestitures\nIn September 2017, PPG completed the sale of its North American fiber glass business to Nippon Electric Glass Co. and received approximately $540 million in pre-tax cash proceeds.\nDuring 2016, PPG finalized the sale of its flat glass business and several other businesses and business affiliates. The Company received total pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion from these business divestitures. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nCash used for financing activities - continuing operations\n\n2017 vs. 2016\nThe $744 million increase in cash used for financing activities - continuing operations, was primarily due to repayment of long term debt and higher dividends in 2017, partially offset by issuance of long term debt in 2016 and lower net purchases of treasury stock year-over-year.\n2016 vs. 2015\nThe $398 million increase in cash used for financing activities - continuing operations, was primarily due to higher dividends in 2016, higher net purchases of treasury stock year-over-year, lower net issuance of long term debt in 2016, partially offset by lower taxes withheld for share-based payments.\nShare repurchase activity \nWe anticipate completing additional share repurchases during 2018. The Company has approximately $3.6 billion remaining under the current authorizations from the Board of Directors, the latest of which was approved in December 2017. The current authorized repurchase programs have no expiration date.\nDividends paid to shareholders \nPPG has paid uninterrupted annual dividends since 1899, and 2017 marked the 46th consecutive year of increased annual per-share dividend payments to shareholders. The Company raised its per-share dividend by 13% to $0.45 per share in July 2017.\nDebt issued and repaid\n\n\nThe ratio of total debt, including capital leases, to total debt and equity was 43% at December 31, 2017 down from 47% in 2016.\n2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 35\nCredit agreements and lines of credit\nIn December 2015, PPG entered into a five-year credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with several banks and financial institutions as further discussed in Note 8, Borrowings and Lines of Credit\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.8 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement will terminate on December 18, 2020. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under the existing or the prior Credit Agreement.\nIn addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit, the Company has an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC pursuant to which it may issue, offer and sell from time to time on a continuous or delayed basis any combination of securities in one or more offerings.\nSee Note 8, Borrowings and Lines of Credit,\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding notes entered into and repaid as well as details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit, guarantees and debt covenants.\nContractual obligations\nWe continue to believe that our cash on hand and short term investments, cash from operations and the Company's access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital spending, acquisitions, dividend payments, debt service, share repurchases, contributions to pension plans, and PPG's significant contractual obligations. These significant contractual obligations are presented in the following table.\n\n (1) Includes interest on all outstanding debt. \n (2) Includes the high end of the range of the expected mandatory pension contributions for 2018 only and U.S. contributions made in January 2018, as PPG is unable to estimate the pension contributions beyond 2018. \n (3) The unconditional purchase commitments are principally take-or-pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases and electricity, consistent with customary industry practice.  Other liquidity matters\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d) which, among other things lowered the U.S. corporate statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminated certain", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

interest rate debt outstanding during 2017. Interest expense, net of Interest income increased $13 million in 2016 versus 2015 as interest income decreased year-over-year due to lower interest rates and lower average cash deposits on hand.\nBusiness restructuring\nIn 2016, PPG recorded a pre-tax business restructuring charge of $195 million. During 2017, PPG realized approximately $50 million of cost savings related to restructuring actions. Once fully implemented, the total annual savings run rate is expected to be approximately $125 million. Refer to Note 7, \"Business Restructuring\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nIn 2015, PPG recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $136 million, of which about 85% represented employee severance and other cash charges. As of December 31, 2016, substantially all actions have been completed.\n24 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K\nPension settlements\nDuring 2017, PPG made lump-sum payments to certain retirees who had participated in PPG's U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans totaling approximately $127 million. As the lump-sum payments were in excess of the expected 2017 service and interest costs for the affected plans, PPG remeasured the periodic benefit obligation of these plans in the period payments were made and recorded settlement charges totaling $60 million ($38 million after-tax) during 2017.\nDuring 2016, PPG permanently transferred approximately $1.8 billion of its U.S. and Canadian pension obligations and assets to several highly rated insurance companies. These actions triggered remeasurement and partial settlement of certain of the Company's defined benefit pension plans. PPG recognized a $968 million pre-tax settlement charge in connection with these transactions. Refer to Note 12, \"Employee Benefit Plans\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nOther charges\nOther charges in 2017 were lower than 2016 due to the absence of environmental charges and certain asset write-downs. In 2016, Other charges were higher than in 2015 due to environmental charges of $82 million. These charges were principally for environmental remediation at a former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in New Jersey.\nOther income\nOther income was higher in 2017 than in 2016 primarily due to the gain from the sale of the Mexican Plaka business of $25 million. Other income in 2016 was higher than in 2015 due to gains totaling $46 million resulting from the sale of a PPG legacy U.S. automotive glass and services business and a U.S. business affiliate, higher equity earnings from a 2017 acquisition of a 40% interest in a joint venture and was partially offset by the absence of certain business transaction-related gains.\nEffective tax rate and earnings per diluted share, continuing operations\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183.9%\n</td> <td>(47.5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>30.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>27.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>23.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>3.1%\n</td> <td>3.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted effective tax rate*\n</td> <td>24.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>24.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>23.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.2)%\n</td> <td>0.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per diluted share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$4.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159.5%\n</td> <td>(57.2)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings per diluted share*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5%\n</td> <td>6.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*See the Regulation G reconciliations - results of operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe effective tax rate for the year-ended December 31, 2017 was 30.7% and increased 3.1% from the prior year primarily due to recording the net charge triggered by the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This charge is approximately $37 million higher than the net charge included in PPG's fourth quarter earnings release and Form 8-K furnished on January 18, 2018, primarily due to new IRS regulations issued and refinements of management estimates.\nAs reported, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased year-over-year, primarily due to the absence of the pension settlement charge of $616 million after-tax recorded in 2016. Refer to the Regulation G Reconciliations - Results of Operations for additional information. The Company's earnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per diluted share both benefited from the 7.4 million, 10.7 million and 7.0 million shares of stock repurchased in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nRegulation G Reconciliations - Results of Operations\nPPG Industries believes investors' understanding of the company's operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income, earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate adjusted for certain charges. PPG's management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company's ongoing operating performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations. Net income and earnings per diluted share adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for net income or earnings per diluted share or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, adjusted net income, earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies.\n2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND

Segment income margins expanded, increasing 40 basis points year-over-year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLooking Ahead\nIn the first quarter 2018, we expect sales volumes in the architectural coatings - Americas and Asia Pacific business to be seasonally lower than the fourth quarter 2017. In addition, overall volume trends by customer channel are anticipated to be consistent with the fourth quarter 2017. The PPG TIMELESS\u00ae product, launched in certain HOME DEPOT\u00ae stores in 2017, is projected to continue to meet our sales targets and is being expanded to more locations during 2018. We also anticipate additional growth-related spending of up to $5 million in the first quarter to support the continued momentum in the region. The volume growth trend for architectural coatings - EMEA is expected to improve modestly in the first quarter 2018, with results remaining uneven by country. We expect continued, high end-use demand in our automotive refinish coatings business as customers continue to adopt PPG's industry leading technologies. In aerospace coatings, we anticipate continued improvement in industry demand growth. The protective and marine coatings business is expected to perform in-line with the market in the first quarter 2018.\nWe expect raw material costs to remain elevated in the first-quarter 2018 at similar levels experienced in the fourth quarter. Further selling price increases in 2018 will be needed to offset more recent raw material inflation. There will be no material benefit from acquisition-related sales in the segment, and, based on mid-January exchange rates, foreign currency translation is expected to have a similar sequential favorable impact on segment sales and income in the first quarter 2018.\nDue to the timing of the Easter holiday, there is one fewer ship day in the first-quarter 2018 compared to first-quarter 2017, which is expected to unfavorably impact global architectural coatings sales volumes by about $20 million to $25 million in net sales. This unfavorable impact will reverse in the second quarter.\n28 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K\nIndustrial Coatings\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$6,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$328\n</td> <td>$214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8%\n</td> <td>3.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(70)\n</td> <td>$57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7)%\n</td> <td>5.8%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial Coatings segment net sales increased (6%) due to the following:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25cf Higher sales volumes (+4%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25cf Acquisition-related sales (+3%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Partially offset by:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25cf Lower selling prices (1%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PPG's automotive OEM coatings sales volumes increased by a low-single-digit percentage versus the prior year, consistent with the global automotive industry production growth rate, led by China, Mexico, Europe and Brazil.

Segment income margins continued to improve, increasing 30 basis points year-over-year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 29\nLooking ahead\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we expect global automotive industry production growth to be about 1% led by Europe and Mexico. In China, automotive production is expected to modestly decrease in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting the expiration of a small engine subsidy that had been in effect the past several years. We anticipate solid general industrial demand growth trends to continue in aggregate, but remain mixed by geography and end-use market. PPG's market outperformance is expected to continue. In our packaging coatings business, we anticipate volume growth will continue due to the ongoing industry conversion to BPA non-intent interior can coatings, with PPG's year-over-year growth rates continuing at an above market level in 2018. We expect acquisition-related sales to add approximately $30 million to first quarter 2018 segment sales and, based on mid-January exchange rates, foreign currency translation is expected to have a similar sequential favorable impact on segment sales and income in the first quarter 2018.\nSegment margin recovery continues to be a priority for 2018. Based on recent raw material inflation, segment margin recovery is expected to continue through the first half of 2018. All businesses in the segment have made progress with selling price initiatives and additional price increases have been announced for early 2018. Also, efforts to reduce costs remain a key focus in 2018.\nReview and Outlook\nDuring 2017, economic conditions improved in all of our major geographical regions while remaining mixed by end-use market. PPG's aggregate organic sales grew 1.5% versus the prior year and were higher in the second half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2017. Acquisition-related sales from two acquisitions completed in 2016 and the four completed in 2017 contributed over 1% to net sales growth year-over-year. Foreign currency translation was modestly favorable to net sales year-over-year. Favorable foreign currency translation experienced in the second half of 2017 slightly offset unfavorable impacts during the first half of the year. Raw material inflation rose by a mid-single-digit percentage driven mostly by supply related factors, including an unusual high number of supplier force majeure events in Europe, government mandated production curtailments in China to help improve pollution, and severe hurricanes in the U.S. In addition, oil prices moved sharply higher in the second half of the year also contributing to raw material inflation.\nU.S. and Canada\nDuring 2017, the pace of economic activity improved in the U.S. and Canada region versus the prior year, with higher industrial production despite lower automotive industry builds. Demand in the residential and commercial construction markets were modestly higher in 2017 compared to 2016. New home starts advanced about 2% in 2017 versus approximately 6% in 2016. Residential remodeling declined 1% in 2017 versus 2016, while commercial construction was flat compared to 7% growth in 2016. Market demand for architectural paint shifted more to trade paint as U.S. unemployment continued to decline. Demand in the overall U.S. DIY paint market remained soft throughout the year. PPG's architectural coatings performance in the U.S. followed market trends with solid improvement in company-owned same store sales throughout the year. The automotive refinish coatings business benefited from higher miles driven and more congestion on the roads due to lower unemployment. PPG's packaging coatings business continued to expand well ahead of the industry end-use market growth driven by continued strong sales growth momentum related to customer adoption of PPG's new interior can coatings technologies. Similar to 2016, PPG's automotive OEM coatings business lagged industry demand levels due to a customer-driven market-share shift away from PPG that was offset in other regions of the world. The U.S. and Canada region remained PPG's largest, representing approximately 43% of 2017 sales, although a smaller percentage of total sales than in the prior year.\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\nEuropean economic activity improved in 2017 despite continued regional uncertainty over the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union. Overall GDP and industrial production improved in the region. Regional demand continued to be mixed by country and end-use market. Demand for PPG's products in several end-use markets drove the regional growth rate, including above market performance in automotive OEM coatings, aerospace coatings and specialty coatings and materials. PPG's architectural coatings - EMEA business sales volumes decreased year-over-year, driven by soft market demand in France and more competitive pressures in Northern and Eastern Europe.\nEMEA represented approximately 30% of PPG's 2017 sales, similar to prior year levels. Regional coatings volumes remain approximately 13% below their pre-recession levels in 2008. The modest volume recovery reflects the slow pace of economic growth in the region. PPG expects continued volume growth over time at attractive incremental margins due to significant cost structure improvements and available capacity to satisfy additional demand. In the second half of the year, the euro appreciated approximately 5% against the U.S. dollar. The British pound recovered some of its 2016 declines versus the U.S. dollar gaining about 10% from the start of 2017.\n30 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K\nAsia Pacific and Latin America\nThe emerging regional markets of Asia Pacific and Latin America represented 27% of PPG's 2017 sales in aggregate, 200 basis points higher than the prior year.\nAsia remained the largest emerging region, with sales of approximately $2.5 billion, led by China, which continued as PPG's second largest country by revenue. Sales volume growth in Asia was led by the Industrial Coatings segment, in part due to strong sales volume growth in general industrial and automotive OEM. These increases were partially offset by the continued demand decline in the marine shipbuilding industry.\nOverall, demand in Latin America improved year-over-year, with continued above market growth in Mexico and Central America. Economic conditions modestly improved in South America, primarily led by Brazil. In Mexico, the PPG-Comex business added over 200 new concessionaire locations, and strong growth continued in the automotive industry due to the opening of new automotive assembly plants within the country in the past 18 months. Foreign currency translation turned favorable in the second half of the year, principally the Mexican peso and Chinese yuan. In Central America, the Company continued to grow organically following a 2015 acquisition to expand its presence in the architectural end-use market.\nRegional Outlook\nLooking ahead to 2018, we expect to continue to operate in a more balanced global growth environment. We anticipate the positive economic trends in 2017 to mostly continue. We expect economic growth rates to remain consistent with 2017 for the U.S. and Canada, Europe, and Asia Pacific regions, and we expect the Latin America region will increase its economic growth year-over-year, when compared to 2017.\nWe anticipate PPG's U.S. and Canada regional growth will be led by general industrial coatings and packaging coatings, with flat automotive industry builds. We expect growth in the housing and commercial construction markets to be better than 2017.\nWe expect growth rates in Europe to stay at similar levels as 2017 but will remain mixed by sub-region and country. Favorable end-use market trends are expected to continue, particularly in automotive OEM coatings as industry build growth rates are anticipated to remain positive. Market demand is expected to improve in the architectural coatings business. There is greater risk to the economic environment in the U.K. as their exit from the European Union progresses.\nIn Asia Pacific, we expect continued industrial production growth in China as well as gains in Southeast Asia and India. In China, we see continued above global average growth with heightened risk as the Chinese economy continues to shift and rely more on domestic consumption. The regional declines in marine coatings sales volumes were less severe in the second half of 2017, and we expect a moderate recovery in sales volumes starting in the second half of 2018. Automotive build growth is expected to remain modestly positive.\nIn Latin America, we anticipate economic expansion will be led by Brazil and that Mexico's economic conditions will modestly improve.\nSignificant other factors\nDuring 2017, PPG finalized the divestiture of its North American fiber glass business. This is a transformational milestone for the Company as it completed the culmination of a multi-year strategic shift in the company's business portfolio. The pre-tax cash proceeds from the sale were approximately $540 million.\nIn December 2016, PPG initiated a $195 million global restructuring program, with anticipated annual savings of approximately $125 million once fully implemented. The expected cost savings are broadly spread across all regions and all business units. The company achieved approximately $50 million of savings in 2017 and expects to achieve the full annualized target of $125 million by 2019. PPG will continue to aggressively manage the company's cost structure to ensure alignment with the overall demand environment and make adjustments as required to remain competitive in the marketplace.\nRaw materials are a significant input cost to the process of manufacturing coatings. PPG experiences fluctuating energy and raw material costs driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, and global supply and demand factors. In aggregate, average raw material costs were higher in 2017 versus 2016, due to supplier force majeure, natural disasters and environmental regulation enforcement. PPG currently expects overall coatings raw material prices to increase a mid-single-digit percentage in the first half of 2018, with impacts varied by region and commodity.\nIn 2017, aggregate selling prices were modestly higher year-over-year, reflecting the company's efforts to offset higher raw material costs. We expect to see further benefits from selling price actions taken in 2017 and other actions planned in 2018 to recover profit contribution margins. The Company will carefully monitor raw material costs during 2018 and assess the need for additional increases to selling prices to compensate for increases in raw material costs.\n2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 31\nPension and postretirement benefit costs, excluding settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits, totaled approximately $50 million in 2017, down approximately $70 million from 2016. In 2018, we expect pension and other postretirement benefit costs to decrease by approximately $15 million to $20 million due to strong 2017 asset performance improving the expected return on assets component of net periodic benefit cost as well as certain U.S. plan changes made in 2017.\nPPG contributed $54 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2017 and an additional $25 million in January 2018. In 2017, the Company made contributions aggregating $33 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In 2018, mandatory contributions to PPG's non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be between $20 million and $30 million.\nIn 2017, unfavorable foreign currency translation experienced in the first half was completely offset by favorable foreign currency translation experienced in the second half of the year. Based on mid-January 2018 exchange rates, the Company expects year-over-year favorable foreign currency translation to increase 2018 sales by $250 million to $300 million and 2018 income before income taxes by $25 million to $30 million. We expect the foreign currency translation impact to be more prevalent during the first half of 2018, due to prior year foreign exchange rate trends. The foreign currency environment continues to be volatile and the impact on 2018 net sales and income before income taxes could differ from the guidance provided above. The Company generally purchases raw materials, incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in the same currency, so we typically incur only modest foreign currency transaction costs.\nWith the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company's 2018 effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 23.0% and 24.0%. This range represents the Company's best estimate, including the new legislation, however, our estimate is subject to revision as the Company completes its assessment of the new law and as additional regulations and interpretations are issued. Other factors may affect the expected 2018 effective tax rate positively or negatively throughout the year, including changes to various statutory tax rates and regulations around the world.\nOver the past four years, the Company used $3.4 billion of cash to repurchase about 33 million shares of PPG stock, including over $800 million in 2017. The Company ended the year with approximately $3.6 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorizations. During 2017, the Company deployed approximately $325 million for acquisitions and $434 million for dividends. PPG increased its per-share dividend in July 2017, marking the 46th annual increase and the 118th consecutive year of dividend payments. The Company is committed to deploying a minimum of $2.4 billion of cash during 2018 on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of our previously communicated commitment to deploy $3.5 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined. In 2017, PPG deployed $1.1 million for acquisitions and share repurchases.\nPPG ended 2017 with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. The Company expects continued strong cash generation in 2018.\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2017\nNote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the Company's recently adopted accounting pronouncements.\nAccounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Years\nNote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes accounting pronouncements that have been promulgated prior to December 31, 2017 but are not effective until a future date.\nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities, including Environmental Matters\nPPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and Note 13, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,\u201d under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of certain of these lawsuits.\nAs discussed in Item 3 and Note 13, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including asbestos-related claims, will not have a material effect on PPG's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.\nIt is PPG's policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. In management's opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the Company's environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on PPG's financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. Management anticipates that the resolution of the Company's environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time.\n32 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K\nThe Company continues to analyze, assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with PPG's former chromium manufacturing plant in Jersey City, N.J. and associated sites ( New Jersey Chrome\u201d). Information will continue to be generated from the ongoing groundwater remedial investigation activities related to New Jersey Chrome and will be incorporated into a final draft remedial action work plan for groundwater expected to be submitted to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 2021.\nThere are multiple, future events yet to occur, including further remedy selection and design, remedy implementation and execution and applicable governmental agency or community organization approvals. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding the timing of these future events for the New Jersey Chrome sites. Final resolution of these events is expected to occur over the next several years. As these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation remedies change, the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will be adjusted.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the past three years, PPG has had sufficient financial resources to meet its operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, including acquisitions, share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to shareholders.\nCash and cash equivalents and short-term investments\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash from operating activities - continuing operations\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash from operating activities\n</td> <td>$1,556\n</td> <td>$1,218\n</td> <td>$1,759\n</td> <td>27.8%\n</td> <td>(30.8)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 vs. 2016\nThe $338 million increase in cash from operating activities - continuing operations, was primarily due to the absence of the prior year funding of the Pittsburgh Corning asbestos trust (the Trust\u201d), lower defined benefit pension contributions, lower restructuring payments and lower interest payments, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid in 2017 and higher working capital.\n2016 vs. 2015\nThe $541 million decrease in cash from operating activities - continuing operations, was primarily due to the after-tax funding of the Trust, partially offset by lower working capital and lower defined benefit pension contributions.\nOperating working capital\nOperating Working Capital is a subset of total working capital and represents (1) receivables from customers, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, (2) inventories, and (3) trade liabilities.

We believe Operating Working Capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses.\nA key metric we use to measure our working capital management is Operating Working Capital as a percentage of sales (fourth quarter sales annualized).\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade Receivables, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories, FIFO\n</td> <td>1,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade Creditor's Liabilities\n</td> <td>2,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Working Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Working Capital as a % of fourth quarter sales, annualized\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade Receivables, net as a % of fourth quarter sales, annualized\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Days sales outstanding\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories, FIFO as a % of fourth quarter sales, annualized\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory turnover\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 33\nEnvironmental expenditures\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash outlays related to environmental remediation activities\n</td> <td>$44\n</td> <td>$47\n</td> <td>$109\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect cash outlays for environmental remediation activities in 2018 to be between $25 million and $75 million.\nDefined benefit pension plan contributions Table 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. defined benefit pension plans\n</td> <td>$54\n</td> <td>$134\n</td> <td>$224\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans\n</td> <td>$33\n</td> <td>$54\n</td> <td>$39\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPPG contributed $54 million and $25 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans during 2017 and in January 2018, respectively.

PPG's total cash obligations to fund the Trust totaled $813 million (pre-tax). All payments were applied against a previously established PPG reserve for the total asbestos trust obligation.
