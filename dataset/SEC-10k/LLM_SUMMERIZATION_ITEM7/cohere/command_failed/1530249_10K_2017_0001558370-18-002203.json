Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion and analysis reviews our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto that appear in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with these Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes and the business and financial information provided in this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nFS Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary bank, 1st Security Bank of Washington have been serving the Puget Sound area since 1936. Originally chartered as a credit union, previously known as Washington's Credit Union, the credit union served various select employment groups. On April 1, 2004, the credit union converted to a Washington state-chartered mutual savings bank. On July 9, 2012, the Bank converted from mutual to stock ownership and became the wholly owned subsidiary of FS Bancorp, Inc.\nThe Company is relationship-driven delivering banking and financial services to local families, local and regional businesses and industry niches within distinct Puget Sound area communities, and one loan production office located in the Tri-Cities, Washington. On January 22, 2016, the Company completed the previously announced Branch Purchase from Bank of America, N.A and acquired $186.4 million in deposits and $419,000 in loans based on financial information at that date. The four branches are located in the communities of Port Angeles, Sequim, Port Townsend, and Hadlock, Washington. The Branch Purchase expanded our Puget Sound-focused retail footprint onto the Olympic Peninsula and provided an opportunity to extend our unique brand of community banking into those communities.\nThe Company also maintains its long-standing indirect consumer lending platform which operates throughout the West Coast. The Company emphasizes long-term relationships with families and businesses within the communities served, working with them to meet their financial needs. The Company is actively involved in community activities and events within these market areas, which further strengthens our relationships within those markets.\nThe Company focuses on diversifying revenues, expanding lending channels, and growing the banking franchise. Management remains focused on building diversified revenue streams based upon credit, interest rate, and concentration risks. Our business plan remains as follows:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGrowing and diversifying our loan portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMaintaining strong asset quality;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEmphasizing lower cost core deposits to reduce the costs of funding our loan growth;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCapturing our customers' full relationship by offering a wide range of products and services by leveraging our well-established involvement in our communities and by selectively emphasizing products and services designed to meet our customers' banking needs; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpanding the Company's markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company is a diversified lender with a focus on the origination of indirect home improvement loans, also referred to as fixture secured loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans, home loans, commercial business loans and second mortgage/home equity loan products. Consumer loans, in particular indirect home improvement loans to finance window replacement, gutter replacement, siding replacement, solar panels, and other improvement renovations, is a large portion of the loan portfolio and have traditionally been the mainstay of our lending strategy. At December 31, 2017, consumer loans represented 27.0% of the Company's total gross loan portfolio, down from 28.9% at December 31, 2016, as real estate loan originations have increased at a faster pace than consumer loan originations during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIndirect home improvement lending is dependent on the Bank's relationships with home improvement contractors and dealers. The Company funded $92.8 million, or approximately 6,000 loans during the year ended December 31, 2017,\nusing its indirect home improvement contractor/dealer network located throughout Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, and Colorado with six contractor/dealers responsible for 56.7% of the funded loans dollar volume. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, continuing and growing relationships with home improvement contractors and dealers\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nSince 2012, the Company has had an emphasis on diversifying lending products by expanding commercial real estate, commercial business and residential lending, while maintaining the current size of the consumer loan portfolio. The Company's lending strategies are intended to take advantage of: (1) historical strength in indirect consumer lending, (2) recent market consolidation that has created new lending opportunities and the availability of experienced bankers, and (3) strength in relationship lending. Retail deposits will continue to serve as an important funding source. See Item 1. Business: Lending Activities\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nRecently, improvements in the economy, employment rates, stronger real estate prices, and a general lack of new housing inventory has resulted in our significantly increasing originations of construction loans for properties located in our market areas. We anticipate that construction and development lending will continue to be a strong element of our total loan portfolio in future periods. We will continue to take a disciplined approach in our construction and development lending by concentrating our efforts on loans to builders and developers in our market areas known to us. Originations of construction and development loans increased to $123.3 million in 2017 from $73.7 million in 2016. These short term loans typically mature in six to twelve months. In addition, the funding is usually not fully disbursed at origination, thereby reducing our net loans receivable in the short term. At December 31, 2017, outstanding construction and development loans totaled $143.1 million, or 18.5%, of the gross loan portfolio and consisted of loans for residential and commercial construction projects, primarily for vertical construction and $11.5 million of land acquisition and development loans. Total committed, including unfunded construction and development loans at December 31, 2017, was $222.0 million as compared to $154.3 million at December 31, 2016.\nThe Company is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions, as well as government policies and regulations concerning, among other things, monetary and fiscal affairs. Deposit flows are influenced by a number of factors, including interest rates paid on time deposits, other investments, account maturities, and the overall level of personal income and savings. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for funds, the number and quality of lenders, and regional economic cycles. Sources of funds for lending activities include primarily deposits, including brokered deposits, borrowings, payments on loans and income provided from operations.\nThe Company's earnings are primarily dependent upon net interest income, the difference between interest income and interest expense. Interest income is a function of the balances of loans and investments outstanding during a given period and the yield earned on these loans and investments. Interest expense is a function of the amount of deposits and borrowings outstanding during the same period and interest rates paid on these deposits and borrowings. Another significant influence on the Company's earnings is fee income from mortgage banking activities. The Company's earnings are also affected by the provision for loan losses, service charges and fees, gains from sales of assets, operating expenses and income taxes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCertain of the Company's accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. Management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses, the fair value of servicing rights, derivatives and hedging activity, and the accounting for deferred income taxes. The Company's accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nAllowance for Loan Loss. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. A high degree of judgment is necessary when determining the\namount of the allowance for loan losses. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are: loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans; value of collateral; and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of the allowance at least quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although the Company believes that use of the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. As the Company adds new products to the loan portfolio and expands the Company's market area, management intends to enhance and adapt the methodology to keep pace with the increased size and complexity of the loan portfolio. Changes in any of the above factors could have a significant effect on the calculation of the allowance for loan losses in any given period. Management believes that its systematic methodology continues to be appropriate given the Company's increased size and level of complexity.\nServicing Rights. Servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through the purchase or through the sale of financial assets. Generally, purchased servicing rights are capitalized at the cost to acquire the rights. For sales of mortgage, commercial and consumer loans, a portion of the cost of originating the loan is allocated to the servicing right based on relative fair value. Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage, commercial, or consumer servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as the cost to service, the discount rate, the custodial earnings rate, an inflation rate, ancillary income, prepayment speeds, and default rates and losses. Servicing assets are evaluated quarterly for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into tranches based on predominant characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type, and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual tranche, to the extent that fair value is less than the capitalized amount for the tranches. If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular tranche, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as a recovery and an increase to income. Capitalized servicing rights are stated separately on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized into noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets.\nDerivative and Hedging Activity. ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d requires that derivatives of the Company be recorded in the consolidated financial statements at fair value. Management considers its accounting policy for derivatives to be a critical accounting policy because these instruments have certain interest rate risk characteristics that change in value based upon changes in the capital markets. The Company's derivatives are primarily the result of its mortgage banking activities in the form of commitments to extend credit, commitments to sell loans, To-Be-Announced ( TBA\u201d) mortgage backed securities trades and option contracts to mitigate the risk of the commitments to extend credit. Estimates of the percentage of commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale that may not fund are based upon historical data and current market trends. The fair value adjustments of the derivatives are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income with offsets to other assets or other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIncome Taxes. Income taxes are reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements to show the tax effects of the operations and transactions reported in the consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently payable plus deferred taxes. Accounting Standards Codification, ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes,\u201d requires the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. They are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled and are determined using the assets and liability method of accounting. The deferred income provision represents the difference between net deferred tax asset/liability at the beginning and end of the reported period. In formulating the deferred tax asset, the Company is required to estimate income and taxes in the jurisdiction in which the Company operates. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure for the reported period together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation and the provision for loan losses, for tax and financial reporting purposes.\nDeferred tax liabilities occur when taxable income is smaller than reported income on the income statements due to accounting valuation methods that differ from tax, as well as tax rate estimates and payments made quarterly and\nadjusted to actual at the end of the year. Deferred tax liabilities are temporary differences payable in future periods. The Company had a net deferred tax liability of $607,000, and $1.2 million, at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur Business and Operating Strategy and Goals\nThe Company's primary objective is to operate 1st Security Bank of Washington as a well capitalized, profitable, independent, community-oriented financial institution, serving customers in its primary market area defined generally as the greater Puget Sound market area. The Company's strategy is to provide innovative products and superior customer service to small businesses, industry and geographic niches, and individuals located in its primary market area. Services are currently provided to communities through the main office and 11 full-service bank branches, and are supported with 24/7 access to on-line banking and participation in a worldwide ATM network.\nThe Company focuses on diversifying revenues, expanding lending channels, and growing the banking franchise. Management remains focused on building diversified revenue streams based upon credit, interest rate, and concentration risks. The Board of Directors seeks to accomplish the Company's objectives through the adoption of a strategy designed to improve profitability and maintain a strong capital position and high asset quality. This strategy primarily involves:\nGrowing and diversifying the loan portfolio and revenue streams. The Company is transitioning lending activities from a predominantly consumer-driven model to a more diversified consumer and business model by emphasizing three key lending initiatives: expansion of commercial business lending programs, increasing in-house originations of residential mortgage loans primarily for sale into the secondary market through the mortgage banking program; and commercial real estate lending. Additionally, the Company seeks to diversify the loan portfolio by increasing lending to small businesses in the market area, as well as residential construction lending.\nMaintaining strong asset quality. The Company believes that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. The percentage of non-performing loans to total gross loans and the percentage of non-performing assets to total assets were each unchanged at 0.1% for both December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company has actively managed the delinquent loans and non-performing assets by aggressively pursuing the collection of consumer debts and marketing saleable properties upon which were foreclosed or repossessed, work-outs of classified assets and loan charge-offs. In the past several years, the Company also began emphasizing consumer loan originations to borrowers with higher credit scores, generally credit scores over 720 (although the policy allows us to go lower), which has led to lower charge-offs in recent periods. Although the Company plans to place more emphasis on certain lending products, such as commercial and multi-family real estate loans, construction and development loans, including speculative residential construction loans, and commercial business loans, while growing the current size of the one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans and the consumer loan portfolios, the Company continues to manage its credit exposures through the use of experienced bankers and an overall conservative approach to lending.\nEmphasizing lower cost core deposits to reduce the costs of funding loan growth. The Company offers personal and business checking accounts, NOW accounts and savings and money market accounts, which generally are lower-cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit, and are less sensitive to withdrawal when interest rates fluctuate. In order to build a core deposit base, the Company is pursuing a number of strategies. First, a diligent attempt to recruit all commercial loan customers to maintain a deposit relationship with the Company, generally a business checking account relationship to the extent practicable, for the term of their loan. Second, interest rate promotions are provided on savings and checking accounts from time to time to encourage the growth of these types of deposits. Third, by hiring experienced personnel with relationships in the communities we serve.\nCapturing customers' full relationship. The Company offers a wide range of products and services that provide diversification of revenue sources and solidify the relationship with the Bank's customers. The Company focuses on core retail and business deposits, including savings and checking accounts, that lead to long-term customer retention. As part of the commercial lending process cross-selling the entire business banking relationship, including deposit relationships and business banking products, such as online cash management, treasury management, wires, direct deposit, payment processing and remote deposit capture. The Company's mortgage banking program also provides opportunities to cross-sell products to new customers.\nExpanding the Company's markets. In addition to deepening relationships with existing customers, the Company intends to expand business to new customers by leveraging the Company's well-established involvement in the community and by selectively emphasizing products and services designed to meet their banking needs. The Company also intends to pursue expansion in other market areas through selective growth of the home lending network. As an example, through the Branch Purchase, the Company expanded its retail market area onto the Olympic Peninsula into the communities of Port Angeles, Sequim, Port Townsend, and Hadlock, Washington. See Note 2 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nAssets. Total assets increased $153.9 million, or 18.6%, to $981.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $827.9 million at December 31, 2016, primarily the result of an increase in loans receivable, net of $168.2 million, certificates of deposit at other financial institutions of $2.9 million, accrued interest of $1.0 million, and loans held for sale of $910,000, partially offset by a decrease in total cash and cash equivalents of $17.5 million and servicing rights of $1.7 million. The increase in assets was primarily funded by growth in deposits and net proceeds from an underwritten public offering completed in the third quarter of 2017.\nLoans receivable, net, increased $168.2 million, or 28.4%, to $761.6 million at December 31, 2017, from $593.3 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in loans receivable, net was primarily a result of a $108.1 million increase in total real estate loans, including increases in one-to-four-family loans of $39.6 million, multi-family loans of $6.9 million, construction and development loans of $48.6 million, commercial real estate loans of $7.7 million, and home equity loans of $5.2 million, as well as increases in commercial business loans of $26.0 million, and consumer loans of $33.9 million.\nLoans held for sale, consisting of one-to-four-family loans, increased by $910,000, or 1.7%, to $53.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $52.6 million for the prior year due to the increase in fair value and the timing difference between loan fundings and loan sale settlements. The Company continues to expand its home lending operations by hiring additional lending staff and will continue selling one-to-four-family mortgage loans into the secondary market for asset/liability management purposes.\nOne-to-four-family originations, including $698.5 million loans held for sale, $105.2 million portfolio loans including first and second liens, and $8.4 million loans brokered to other institutions, increased 4.1% to $812.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $779.8 million for the prior year. The growth in originations was a result of increased purchase activity associated with the strong home purchase demand in the Pacific Northwest. Originations of one-to-four-family loans to purchase a home (purchase production) increased by $109.1 million, or 21.2% with $624.3 million in loan purchase production closing during the year ended December 31, 2017, up from $515.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. One-to-four-family loan originations for refinance (refinance production) decreased $77.5 million, or 29.3% with $186.9 million in refinance production closing during the year ended December 31, 2017, down from $264.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe allowance for loan losses ( ALLL\u201d) at December 31, 2017 was $10.8 million, or 1.4% of gross loans receivable, excluding loans held for sale, compared to $10.2 million, or 1.7% of gross loans receivable, excluding loans held for sale, at December 31, 2016. Substandard loans decreased $1.6 million, or 19.3%, to $6.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $8.0 million at December 31, 2016. The $1.6 million decrease in substandard loans was primarily due to the sale of a $1.9 million shared national credit with a slight discount to book value charged off against the ALLL in the third quarter of 2017. Non-performing loans, consisting solely of non-accruing loans, increased $318,000, or 44.1%, to $1.0 million at December 31, 2017, from $721,000 at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, non-performing loans consisted of $551,000 of commercial business loans, $293,000 of residential real estate loans, and $195,000 of consumer loans.\nNon-performing loans to total gross loans were unchanged at 0.1% at both December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. There was no other real estate owned at December 31, 2017 and 2016. See Item 1. Business - Lending Activities - Asset Quality\u201d of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's non-performing loans.\nDuring the second quarter of 2017, the Company sold $564.8 million of the MSA with a MSR book value of $4.8 million and generated an associated gain of $1.1 million. Under regulatory capital guidelines, MSAs are limited to 10% of the Bank's common equity Tier 1 capital. MSAs in excess of the 10% threshold must be deducted from common equity for regulatory capital purposes. The sale of this asset allows the Bank to remain below the maximum 10% regulatory capital limitation with the expectation that continued MSAs will be generated from future residential loan sales.\nLiabilities. Total liabilities increased $112.9 million, or 15.1%, to $859.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $746.9 million at December 31, 2016. Deposits increased $117.2 million, or 16.5% to $829.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $712.6 million at December 31, 2016. Relationship-based transactional accounts (noninterest-bearing checking, interest-bearing checking, and escrow accounts) increased $87.7 million, or 40.1%, to $306.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $219.0 million at December 31, 2016. Money market and savings accounts increased $3.0 million, or 1.0%, to $300.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $297.8 million at December 31, 2016. Time deposits increased $26.5 million, or 13.6%, to $222.3 million at December 31, 2017, from $195.7 million at December 31, 2016. Non-retail certificates of deposit which includes brokered certificates of deposit, online certificates of deposit, and public funds, increased $6.3 million, or 10.5%, to $66.5 million, at December 31, 2017, compared to $60.2 million at December 31, 2016. Management remains focused on growth in lower cost relationship-based deposits to fund long-term asset growth.\nAt December 31, 2017, borrowings decreased $5.1 million, or 40.6%, to $7.5 million from $12.7 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to the repayment of FHLB fixed rate advances.\nStockholders' Equity. Total stockholders' equity increased $41.0 million, or 50.6%, to $122.0 million at December 31, 2017, from $81.0 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in stockholders' equity was primarily from net proceeds of $25.6 million from an underwritten public offering completed in the third quarter of 2017 and net income of $14.1 million. Book value per common share was $34.47 at December 31, 2017, compared to $28.32 at December 31, 2016.\n\t\t\t \t\t\nAverage Balances, Interest and Average Yields/Cost\nThe following table sets forth for the periods indicated, information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest-earning assets and interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, resultant yields, interest rate spread, net interest margin (otherwise known as net yield on interest-earning assets), and the ratio of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities. Also presented is the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets, rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant spread at December 31, 2017. Income and all average balances are monthly average balances. Non-accruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $3.6 million, or 34.2%, to $14.1 million, from $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net income was primarily a result of an $8.2 million, or 21.5% increase in interest income, a $1.7 million reduction in the provision for loan losses, and a $505,000, or 2.1% increase in noninterest income, partially offset by a $5.1 million, or 13.0% increase in noninterest expense, an $890,000, or 15.9% increase in the provision for income tax expense, and a $770,000, or 18.5% increase in interest expense.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income increased $7.4 million, or 21.8%, to $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to a $7.7 million, or 21.5% increase in loan receivable interest income resulting from a $130.6 million increase in average loans receivable, net and loans held for sale over the last year, and a $476,000, or 21.2% increase in interest and dividends on investment securities, and cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by a $770,000 or 18.5% increase in total interest expense.\nThe net interest margin ( NIM\u201d) increased 22 basis points to 4.65% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 4.43% for the same period last year. The increased NIM reflects continued growth in higher yielding loans, and reductions in securities AFS and cash and cash equivalents. The average cost of funds for total interest-bearing liabilities increased\ntwo basis points to 0.76% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 0.74% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Management remains focused on matching deposit duration with the duration of earning assets where appropriate.\nInterest Income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $8.2 million, or 21.5%, to $46.2 million, from $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase during the year was primarily attributable to an increase in the average balance of loans receivable, net and loans held for sale to $749.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $618.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and a 24 basis point increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets to 5.21% during the year ended December 31, 2017, from 4.97% for the prior year. The increase in average yield on interest-earning assets compared to the prior year primarily reflects the growth in the loan portfolio and the proportionally larger level of loans in the average interest-earning asset mix. The average yield on loans receivable, net and loans held for sale increased to 5.80% during the year ended December 31, 2017, from 5.78% for the prior year.\nThe following table compares average earning asset balances, associated yields, and resulting changes in interest income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease in\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOutstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield/Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOutstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield/Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncome\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoans receivable, net and loans held for sale (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n749,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.80\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n618,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.78\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,685\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFHLB stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest-bearing deposits at other financial institutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n64,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal interest-earning assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n886,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.21\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n764,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.97\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,161\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe average loans receivable, net balances include non-accruing loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $770,000, or 18.5%, to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $4.2 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense on deposits of $666,000, and an increase in interest on borrowings of $108,000. The average cost of funds for total interest-bearing liabilities increased two basis points to 0.76% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 0.74% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The average cost of deposits (excluding noninterest-bearing deposits) slightly increased two basis points to 0.50% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 0.48% for the year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting rising interest rates over the last year and the increase in non-retail certificates of deposit.\nThe following table details average balances for cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities and the change in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Decrease) in\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOutstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOutstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSavings and money market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n315,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.40\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n280,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.36\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest-bearing checking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n88,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n53,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCertificates of deposit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n207,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n192,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBorrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSubordinated note\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n647,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.76\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n562,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.74\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses was $750,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the provision was primarily a result of the relatively low levels of charge-offs, delinquencies, nonperforming and classified loans, as well as the increasing\npercentage of real estate loans compared to consumer loans and improving real estate values in our market areas reducing the increase in the provision for loan losses required for loan growth. Substandard loans decreased $1.6 million, or 19.3%, to $6.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $8.0 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in substandard loans from one year ago was primarily due to the sale of a $1.9 million shared national credit as discussed above. Non-performing loans increased to $1.0 million, or 0.1% of total gross loans at December 31, 2017, compared to $721,000, or 0.1% of total gross loans at December 31, 2016.

While management believes the estimates and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators, as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.\nNoninterest Income.

The gain on sale of loans included a reduction in the favorable fair-value adjustment on derivative financial instruments (commitments to extend credit, commitments to sell loans, mortgage backed securities trades and option contracts) and reflects a reduction of gain on sale margins associated with the product mix in the Pacific Northwest. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a net gain of $2.3\nmillion for changes in the valuation of derivatives carried at fair value, compared to a net gain of $3.1 for the year ended December 31, 2016, which are included in gain on sale of loans. These adjustments in fair value primarily reflect changes in loan volume and interest rate lock commitments issued as a result of subsequent changes in the level of market interest rates. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company originated $812.1 million of one-to-four-family consumer mortgages during 2017 and sold $698.6 million to secondary mortgage market investors, and $19.4 million to another financial institution, compared to sales of $711.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, the margin on loans sold decreased to 2.50% for the year ended December 31 2017, from 2.64% a year ago.\nNoninterest Expense.

Salaries and benefits increased $4.6 million, or 21.0%, which included $1.4 million of commissions and incentives for the loan production staff reflecting our increased loan production, as well as $593,000 of employee stock option plan expense due to the significant increase in our stock price over the last year. Other year over year changes in expenses include a $387,000, or 18.1% increase in data processing, a $268,000, or 11.1% increase in occupancy, a $205,000, or 3.4% increase in operations costs, and a $147,000, or 5.9% increase in loan costs, partially offset by a $389,000, or 100.0% decrease in acquisition costs, and a $246,000, or 12.7% decrease in professional and board fees. There was no gain on the sale of OREO in the current year to offset the increase in expenses as compared to $150,000 last year.\nThe efficiency ratio, which is noninterest expense as a percentage of net interest income and noninterest income, slightly improved to 67.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 67.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016. By definition, a lower efficiency ratio would be an indication that the Company is more efficiently utilizing resources to generate income.\nProvision for Income Tax. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provision for income tax expense of $6.5 million compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflecting both higher pre-tax income and a tax benefit recognized as a result of the Tax Act. The Tax Act required a revaluation the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate income tax rates and other provisions of the legislation. As a result of the Company's revaluation, the Company recognized $396,000 in tax benefit due to a net deferred tax liability position. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was a $607,000 and $1.2 million net deferred tax liability, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 31.6%, compared to 35.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016. For future periods, the Company will be using an estimated tax rate of 21.5% to\naccount for its federal and state income tax expense. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nAsset and Liability Management and Market Risk\nRisk When Interest Rates Change. The rates of interest the Company earns on assets and pays on liabilities generally is established contractually for a period of time. Market rates change over time. Like other financial institutions, the Company's results of operations are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of the Company's assets and liabilities. The risk associated with changes in interest rates and the Company's ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is the most significant market risk.\nHow The Company Measures Risk of Interest Rate Changes. As part of an attempt to manage exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations, the Company monitors interest rate risk. In doing so, the Company analyzes and manages assets and liabilities based on their interest rates and payment streams, timing of maturities, repricing opportunities, and sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates.\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and FHLB advances, reprice more rapidly or at different rates than the interest-earning assets. In order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material prolonged increases or decreases in interest rates on the Company's results of operations, the Company has adopted an Asset and Liability Management Policy. The Board of Directors sets the Asset and Liability Management Policy for the Bank, which is implemented by the asset/liability committee ( ALCO\u201d), an internal management committee. The board level oversight for ALCO is performed by the audit committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe purpose of the ALCO is to communicate, coordinate, and control asset/liability management consistent with the business plan and board-approved policies. The committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources, taking into account relative costs and spreads, interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs. The objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity, capital adequacy, growth, risk and profitability goals.\nThe committee generally meets monthly to, among other things, protect capital through earnings stability over the interest rate cycle; maintain the Bank's well capitalized status; and provide a reasonable return on investment. The committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review. The committee is responsible for reviewing and reporting the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the Board of Directors at least quarterly. The Chief Financial Officer oversees the process on a daily basis.\nA key element of the Bank's asset/liability management plan is to protect net earnings by managing the maturity or repricing mismatch between interest-earning assets and rate-sensitive liabilities. The Company seeks to accomplish this by extending funding maturities through wholesale funding sources, including the use of FHLB advances and brokered certificates of deposit, and through asset management, including the use of adjustable-rate loans and selling certain fixed-rate loans in the secondary market. Management is also focused on matching deposit duration with the duration of earning assets as appropriate.\nAs part of the efforts to monitor and manage interest rate risk, a number of indicators are used to monitor overall risk. Among the measurements are:\nMarket Risk. Market risk is the potential change in the value of investment securities if interest rates change. This change in value impacts the value of the Company and the liquidity of the securities. Market risk is controlled by setting a maximum average maturity/average life of the securities portfolio to 10 years.\nEconomic Risk. Economic risk is the risk that the underlying value of a bank will change when rates change. This can be caused by a change in value of the existing assets and liabilities (this is called Economic Value of Equity or EVE), or a change in the earnings stream (this is caused by interest rate risk). The Company takes economic risk primarily when fixed rate loans are made, or purchase fixed-rate investments, or issue long term certificates of deposit or take fixed-rate FHLB advances. It is the risk that interest rates will change and these fixed-rate assets and liabilities will change in value. This change in value usually is not recognized in the earnings, or equity (other than marking to market securities\navailable-for-sale or fair value adjustments on loans held for sale). The change is recognized only when the assets and liabilities are liquidated. Although the change in market value is usually not recognized in earnings or in capital, the impact is real to the long-term value of 1st Security Bank of Washington. Therefore, the Company will control the level of economic risk by limiting the amount of long-term, fixed-rate assets the Company will have and by setting a limit on concentrations and maturities of securities.\nInterest Rate Risk. If the Federal Reserve Board changes the Fed Funds rate 100, 200 or 300 basis points, the Bank policy dictates that a change in net interest income should not change more that 7.5%, 15% and 30%, respectively.\nThe table presented below, as of December 31, 2017, is an analysis prepared for 1st Security Bank of Washington by Olson Research Associates, Inc. utilizing various market and actual experience-based assumptions. The table represents a static shock to the net interest income using instantaneous and sustained shifts in the yield curve, in 100 basis point increments, up and down 100 basis points. No rates in the model are allowed to go below zero. Given the low interest rate environment, reduction in rates by 200 and 300 basis points are not reported. The results reflect a projected income statement with minimal exposure to instantaneous changes in interest rates. These results are primarily based upon historical prepayment speeds within the consumer lending portfolio in combination with the above average yields associated with the consumer portfolio if those prepayments do not occur. The current targeted Fed Funds rate is a range of 1.25 to 1.50% making a 200 and 300 basis point decrease impossible.\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRates in Basis Points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n300bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n45,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.36\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n200bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n100bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n44,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n0bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n43,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(100)bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n42,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,854)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.23)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn managing the assets/liability mix the Company typically places an equal emphasis on maximizing net interest margin and matching the interest rate sensitivity of the assets and liabilities. From time to time, however, depending on the relationship between long- and short-term interest rates, market conditions and consumer preference, the Company may place somewhat greater emphasis on maximizing net interest margin than on strict dollar for dollar categories matching the interest rate sensitivity of the assets and liabilities. Management also believes that the increased net income which may result from a prepayment assumption denied mismatch in the actual maturity or repricing of the asset and liability portfolios can, during periods of changing interest rates, provide sufficient returns to justify the increased exposure to sudden and unexpected increases in interest rates which may result from such a mismatch. Management believes that 1st Security Bank of Washington's level of interest rate risk is acceptable under this approach.\nIn evaluating 1st Security Bank of Washington's exposure to interest rate movements, certain shortcomings inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing periods, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgages, have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a significant change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed above. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. 1st Security Bank of Washington considers all of these factors in monitoring its exposure to interest rate risk.\nLiquidity\nManagement maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit runoff that may occur in the normal course of business. The Company relies on a number of different sources in order to meet potential liquidity demands. The primary sources are increases in deposit accounts, FHLB advances,\npurchases of Fed Funds, sale of securities available-for-sale, cash flows from loan payments, sales of one-to-four-family loans held for sale, and maturing securities.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Bank's total borrowing capacity was $209.7 million with the FHLB of Des Moines, with unused borrowing capacity of $201.0 million at that date. The FHLB borrowing limit is based on certain categories of loans, primarily real estate loans that qualify as collateral for FHLB advances. At December 31, 2017, the Bank held approximately $318.5 million in loans that qualify as collateral for FHLB advances.\nIn addition to the availability of liquidity from the FHLB of Des Moines, the Bank maintained a short-term borrowing line with the Federal Reserve Bank, with a current limit of $99.1 million, and a combined credit limit of $43.0 million in written Fed Funds lines of credit through correspondent banking relationships as of December 31, 2017. The Federal Reserve Bank borrowing limit is based on certain categories of loans, primarily consumer loans that qualify as collateral for Federal Reserve Bank line of credit. At December 31, 2017, the Bank held approximately $203.3 million in loans that qualify as collateral for the Federal Reserve Bank line of credit.\nAt December 31, 2017, $7.5 million in FHLB advances and FHLB Fed Funds were outstanding, and no advances were outstanding against the Federal Reserve Bank line of credit, and Fed Funds lines of credit. The Bank's Asset and Liability Management Policy permits management to utilize brokered deposits up to 20% of deposits or $167.0 million as of December 31, 2017. Total brokered deposits as of December 31, 2017 were $59.3 million. Management utilizes brokered deposits to mitigate interest rate risk exposure where appropriate.\nLiquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of Company management. Excess liquidity is generally invested in short-term investments, such as overnight deposits and Fed Funds. On a longer term basis, a strategy is maintained of investing in various lending products and investment securities, including U.S. Government obligations and U.S. agency securities. The Company uses sources of funds primarily to meet ongoing commitments, pay maturing deposits and fund withdrawals, and to fund loan commitments. At December 31, 2017, the approved outstanding loan commitments, including unused lines of credit, amounted to $284.9 million. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at December 31, 2017, totaled $108.1 million. It is management's policy to offer deposit rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions. Based on this management strategy, the Company believes that a majority of maturing deposits will remain with the Bank.\nAs a separate legal entity from the Bank, FS Bancorp, Inc. must provide for its own liquidity. Sources of capital and liquidity for the FS Bancorp, Inc. include distributions from the Bank and the issuance of debt or equity securities. Dividends and other capital distributions from the Bank are subject to regulatory notice. At December 31, 2017, FS Bancorp, Inc. had $5.2 million in unrestricted\u201d cash to meet liquidity needs.\nOff-Balance Sheet Activities\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers. For information regarding our commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nA summary of off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2017 was as follows:\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOff-balance sheet loan commitments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal estate secured (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n111,202\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial business loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n130,755\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHome equity loans and lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32,889\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsumer loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,041\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal commitments to extend credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n284,887\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncludes held for sale interest rate lock commitments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Resources\nThe Bank is subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by the FDIC. Based on its capital levels at December 31, 2017, the Bank exceeded these requirements as of that date. Consistent with our goals to operate a sound and profitable organization, our policy is for the Bank to maintain a well capitalized status under the capital categories of the FDIC. Based on capital levels at December 31, 2017, the Bank was considered to be well capitalized. At December 31, 2017, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with Tier 1 leverage-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital, and common equity Tier 1 ( CET1\u201d) capital ratios of 12.6%, 15.0%, 16.3%, and 15.0%, respectively. For additional information regarding the Bank's regulatory capital compliance, see the discussion included in Note 14 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, the Company raised gross proceeds of $27.6 million from an underwritten public offering for the sale of 587,234 shares of its common stock with net proceeds after underwriting fees and costs of $25.6 million. Capital proceeds receive from the offering were used to fund the majority of a $26.0 million contribution to the Bank at the end of the third quarter of 2017 to provide additional capital for growth planned over the next 24 months.\nFor a bank holding company with less than $1 billion in consolidated assets, such as FS Bancorp, Inc., the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis and the Federal Reserve requires the holding company's subsidiary banks to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. If FS Bancorp, Inc. was subject to regulatory guidelines for bank holding companies with $1 billion or more in assets, at December 31, 2017, FS Bancorp, Inc. would have exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.\nThe following table compares 1st Security Bank of Washington's actual capital amounts at December 31, 2017, to its minimum regulatory capital requirements at that date:\nTable 135:

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion and analysis reviews our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto that appear in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with these Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes and the business and financial information provided in this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nFS Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary bank, 1st Security Bank of Washington have been serving the Puget Sound area since 1936. Originally chartered as a credit union, previously known as Washington's Credit Union, the credit union served various select employment groups. On April 1, 2004, the credit union converted to a Washington state-chartered mutual savings bank. On July 9, 2012, the Bank converted from mutual to stock ownership and became the wholly owned subsidiary of FS Bancorp, Inc.\nThe Company is relationship-driven delivering banking and financial services to local families, local and regional businesses and industry niches within distinct Puget Sound area communities, and one loan production office located in the Tri-Cities, Washington. On January 22, 2016, the Company completed the previously announced Branch Purchase from Bank of America, N.A and acquired $186.4 million in deposits and $419,000 in loans based on financial information at that date. The four branches are located in the communities of Port Angeles, Sequim, Port Townsend, and Hadlock, Washington. The Branch Purchase expanded our Puget Sound-focused retail footprint onto the Olympic Peninsula and provided an opportunity to extend our unique brand of community banking into those communities.\nThe Company also maintains its long-standing indirect consumer lending platform which operates throughout the West Coast. The Company emphasizes long-term relationships with families and businesses within the communities served, working with them to meet their financial needs. The Company is actively involved in community activities and events within these market areas, which further strengthens our relationships within those markets.\nThe Company focuses on diversifying revenues, expanding lending channels, and growing the banking franchise. Management remains focused on building diversified revenue streams based upon credit, interest rate, and concentration risks. Our business plan remains as follows:\n \u00b7 Growing and diversifying our loan portfolio; \n \u00b7 Maintaining strong asset quality; \n \u00b7 Emphasizing lower cost core deposits to reduce the costs of funding our loan growth; \n \u00b7 Capturing our customers' full relationship by offering a wide range of products and services by leveraging our well-established involvement in our communities and by selectively emphasizing products and services designed to meet our customers' banking needs; and \n \u00b7 Expanding the Company's markets. \nThe Company is a diversified lender with a focus on the origination of indirect home improvement loans, also referred to as fixture secured loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans, home loans, commercial business loans and second mortgage/home equity loan products. Consumer loans, in particular indirect home improvement loans to finance window replacement, gutter replacement, siding replacement, solar panels, and other improvement renovations, is a large portion of the loan portfolio and have traditionally been the mainstay of our lending strategy. At December 31, 2017, consumer loans represented 27.0% of the Company's total gross loan portfolio, down from 28.9% at December 31, 2016, as real estate loan originations have increased at a faster pace than consumer loan originations during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIndirect home improvement lending is dependent on the Bank's relationships with home improvement contractors and dealers. The Company funded $92.8 million, or approximately 6,000 loans during the year ended December 31, 2017,\nusing its indirect home improvement contractor/dealer network located throughout Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, and Colorado with six contractor/dealers responsible for 56.7% of the funded loans dollar volume. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, continuing and growing relationships with home improvement contractors and dealers\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nSince 2012, the Company has had an emphasis on diversifying lending products by expanding commercial real estate, commercial business and residential lending, while maintaining the current size of the consumer loan portfolio. The Company's lending strategies are intended to take advantage of: (1) historical strength in indirect consumer lending, (2) recent market consolidation that has created new lending opportunities and the availability of experienced bankers, and (3) strength in relationship lending. Retail deposits will continue to serve as an important funding source. See Item 1. Business: Lending Activities\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nRecently, improvements in the economy, employment rates, stronger real estate prices, and a general lack of new housing inventory has resulted in our significantly increasing originations of construction loans for properties located in our market areas. We anticipate that construction and development lending will continue to be a strong element of our total loan portfolio in future periods. We will continue to take a disciplined approach in our construction and development lending by concentrating our efforts on loans to builders and developers in our market areas known to us. Originations of construction and development loans increased to $123.3 million in 2017 from $73.7 million in 2016. These short term loans typically mature in six to twelve months. In addition, the funding is usually not fully disbursed at origination, thereby reducing our net loans receivable in the short term. At December 31, 2017, outstanding construction and development loans totaled $143.1 million, or 18.5%, of the gross loan portfolio and consisted of loans for residential and commercial construction projects, primarily for vertical construction and $11.5 million of land acquisition and development loans. Total committed, including unfunded construction and development loans at December 31, 2017, was $222.0 million as compared to $154.3 million at December 31, 2016.\nThe Company is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions, as well as government policies and regulations concerning, among other things, monetary and fiscal affairs. Deposit flows are influenced by a number of factors, including interest rates paid on time deposits, other investments, account maturities, and the overall level of personal income and savings. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for funds, the number and quality of lenders, and regional economic cycles. Sources of funds for lending activities include primarily deposits, including brokered deposits, borrowings, payments on loans and income provided from operations.\nThe Company's earnings are primarily dependent upon net interest income, the difference between interest income and interest expense. Interest income is a function of the balances of loans and investments outstanding during a given period and the yield earned on these loans and investments. Interest expense is a function of the amount of deposits and borrowings outstanding during the same period and interest rates paid on these deposits and borrowings. Another significant influence on the Company's earnings is fee income from mortgage banking activities. The Company's earnings are also affected by the provision for loan losses, service charges and fees, gains from sales of assets, operating expenses and income taxes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCertain of the Company's accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. Management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses, the fair value of servicing rights, derivatives and hedging activity, and the accounting for deferred income taxes. The Company's accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nAllowance for Loan Loss. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. A high degree of judgment is necessary when determining the\namount of the allowance for loan losses. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are: loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans; value of collateral; and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of the allowance at least quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although the Company believes that use of the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. As the Company adds new products to the loan portfolio and expands the Company's market area, management intends to enhance and adapt the methodology to keep pace with the increased size and complexity of the loan portfolio. Changes in any of the above factors could have a significant effect on the calculation of the allowance for loan losses in any given period. Management believes that its systematic methodology continues to be appropriate given the Company's increased size and level of complexity.\nServicing Rights. Servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through the purchase or through the sale of financial assets. Generally, purchased servicing rights are capitalized at the cost to acquire the rights. For sales of mortgage, commercial and consumer loans, a portion of the cost of originating the loan is allocated to the servicing right based on relative fair value. Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage, commercial, or consumer servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as the cost to service, the discount rate, the custodial earnings rate, an inflation rate, ancillary income, prepayment speeds, and default rates and losses. Servicing assets are evaluated quarterly for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into tranches based on predominant characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type, and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual tranche, to the extent that fair value is less than the capitalized amount for the tranches. If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular tranche, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as a recovery and an increase to income. Capitalized servicing rights are stated separately on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized into noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets.\nDerivative and Hedging Activity. ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d requires that derivatives of the Company be recorded in the consolidated financial statements at fair value. Management considers its accounting policy for derivatives to be a critical accounting policy because these instruments have certain interest rate risk characteristics that change in value based upon changes in the capital markets. The Company's derivatives are primarily the result of its mortgage banking activities in the form of commitments to extend credit, commitments to sell loans, To-Be-Announced ( TBA\u201d) mortgage backed securities trades and option contracts to mitigate the risk of the commitments to extend credit. Estimates of the percentage of commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale that may not fund are based upon historical data and current market trends. The fair value adjustments of the derivatives are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income with offsets to other assets or other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIncome Taxes. Income taxes are reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements to show the tax effects of the operations and transactions reported in the consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently payable plus deferred taxes. Accounting Standards Codification, ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes,\u201d requires the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. They are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled and are determined using the assets and liability method of accounting. The deferred income provision represents the difference between net deferred tax asset/liability at the beginning and end of the reported period. In formulating the deferred tax asset, the Company is required to estimate income and taxes in the jurisdiction in which the Company operates. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure for the reported period together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation and the provision for loan losses, for tax and financial reporting purposes.\nDeferred tax liabilities occur when taxable income is smaller than reported income on the income statements due to accounting valuation methods that differ from tax, as well as tax rate estimates and payments made quarterly and\nadjusted to actual at the end of the year. Deferred tax liabilities are temporary differences payable in future periods. The Company had a net deferred tax liability of $607,000, and $1.2 million, at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur Business and Operating Strategy and Goals\nThe Company's primary objective is to operate 1st Security Bank of Washington as a well capitalized, profitable, independent, community-oriented financial institution, serving customers in its primary market area defined generally as the greater Puget Sound market area. The Company's strategy is to provide innovative products and superior customer service to small businesses, industry and geographic niches, and individuals located in its primary market area. Services are currently provided to communities through the main office and 11 full-service bank branches, and are supported with 24/7 access to on-line banking and participation in a worldwide ATM network.\nThe Company focuses on diversifying revenues, expanding lending channels, and growing the banking franchise. Management remains focused on building diversified revenue streams based upon credit, interest rate, and concentration risks. The Board of Directors seeks to accomplish the Company's objectives through the adoption of a strategy designed to improve profitability and maintain a strong capital position and high asset quality. This strategy primarily involves:\nGrowing and diversifying the loan portfolio and revenue streams. The Company is transitioning lending activities from a predominantly consumer-driven model to a more diversified consumer and business model by emphasizing three key lending initiatives: expansion of commercial business lending programs, increasing in-house originations of residential mortgage loans primarily for sale into the secondary market through the mortgage banking program; and commercial real estate lending. Additionally, the Company seeks to diversify the loan portfolio by increasing lending to small businesses in the market area, as well as residential construction lending.\nMaintaining strong asset quality. The Company believes that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. The percentage of non-performing loans to total gross loans and the percentage of non-performing assets to total assets were each unchanged at 0.1% for both December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company has actively managed the delinquent loans and non-performing assets by aggressively pursuing the collection of consumer debts and marketing saleable properties upon which were foreclosed or repossessed, work-outs of classified assets and loan charge-offs. In the past several years, the Company also began emphasizing consumer loan originations to borrowers with higher credit scores, generally credit scores over 720 (although the policy allows us to go lower), which has led to lower charge-offs in recent periods. Although the Company plans to place more emphasis on certain lending products, such as commercial and multi-family real estate loans, construction and development loans, including speculative residential construction loans, and commercial business loans, while growing the current size of the one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans and the consumer loan portfolios, the Company continues to manage its credit exposures through the use of experienced bankers and an overall conservative approach to lending.\nEmphasizing lower cost core deposits to reduce the costs of funding loan growth. The Company offers personal and business checking accounts, NOW accounts and savings and money market accounts, which generally are lower-cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit, and are less sensitive to withdrawal when interest rates fluctuate. In order to build a core deposit base, the Company is pursuing a number of strategies. First, a diligent attempt to recruit all commercial loan customers to maintain a deposit relationship with the Company, generally a business checking account relationship to the extent practicable, for the term of their loan. Second, interest rate promotions are provided on savings and checking accounts from time to time to encourage the growth of these types of deposits. Third, by hiring experienced personnel with relationships in the communities we serve.\nCapturing customers' full relationship. The Company offers a wide range of products and services that provide diversification of revenue sources and solidify the relationship with the Bank's customers. The Company focuses on core retail and business deposits, including savings and checking accounts, that lead to long-term customer retention. As part of the commercial lending process cross-selling the entire business banking relationship, including deposit relationships and business banking products, such as online cash management, treasury management, wires, direct deposit, payment processing and remote deposit capture. The Company's mortgage banking program also provides opportunities to cross-sell products to new customers.\nExpanding the Company's markets. In addition to deepening relationships with existing customers, the Company intends to expand business to new customers by leveraging the Company's well-established involvement in the community and by selectively emphasizing products and services designed to meet their banking needs. The Company also intends to pursue expansion in other market areas through selective growth of the home lending network. As an example, through the Branch Purchase, the Company expanded its retail market area onto the Olympic Peninsula into the communities of Port Angeles, Sequim, Port Townsend, and Hadlock, Washington. See Note 2 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nAssets. Total assets increased $153.9 million, or 18.6%, to $981.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $827.9 million at December 31, 2016, primarily the result of an increase in loans receivable, net of $168.2 million, certificates of deposit at other financial institutions of $2.9 million, accrued interest of $1.0 million, and loans held for sale of $910,000, partially offset by a decrease in total cash and cash equivalents of $17.5 million and servicing rights of $1.7 million. The increase in assets was primarily funded by growth in deposits and net proceeds from an underwritten public offering completed in the third quarter of 2017.\nLoans receivable, net, increased $168.2 million, or 28.4%, to $761.6 million at December 31, 2017, from $593.3 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in loans receivable, net was primarily a result of a $108.1 million increase in total real estate loans, including increases in one-to-four-family loans of $39.6 million, multi-family loans of $6.9 million, construction and development loans of $48.6 million, commercial real estate loans of $7.7 million, and home equity loans of $5.2 million, as well as increases in commercial business loans of $26.0 million, and consumer loans of $33.9 million.\nLoans held for sale, consisting of one-to-four-family loans, increased by $910,000, or 1.7%, to $53.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $52.6 million for the prior year due to the increase in fair value and the timing difference between loan fundings and loan sale settlements. The Company continues to expand its home lending operations by hiring additional lending staff and will continue selling one-to-four-family mortgage loans into the secondary market for asset/liability management purposes.\nOne-to-four-family originations, including $698.5 million loans held for sale, $105.2 million portfolio loans including first and second liens, and $8.4 million loans brokered to other institutions, increased 4.1% to $812.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $779.8 million for the prior year. The growth in originations was a result of increased purchase activity associated with the strong home purchase demand in the Pacific Northwest. Originations of one-to-four-family loans to purchase a home (purchase production) increased by $109.1 million, or 21.2% with $624.3 million in loan purchase production closing during the year ended December 31, 2017, up from $515.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. One-to-four-family loan originations for refinance (refinance production) decreased $77.5 million, or 29.3% with $186.9 million in refinance production closing during the year ended December 31, 2017, down from $264.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe allowance for loan losses ( ALLL\u201d) at December 31, 2017 was $10.8 million, or 1.4% of gross loans receivable, excluding loans held for sale, compared to $10.2 million, or 1.7% of gross loans receivable, excluding loans held for sale, at December 31, 2016. Substandard loans decreased $1.6 million, or 19.3%, to $6.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $8.0 million at December 31, 2016. The $1.6 million decrease in substandard loans was primarily due to the sale of a $1.9 million shared national credit with a slight discount to book value charged off against the ALLL in the third quarter of 2017. Non-performing loans, consisting solely of non-accruing loans, increased $318,000, or 44.1%, to $1.0 million at December 31, 2017, from $721,000 at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, non-performing loans consisted of $551,000 of commercial business loans, $293,000 of residential real estate loans, and $195,000 of consumer loans.\nNon-performing loans to total gross loans were unchanged at 0.1% at both December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. There was no other real estate owned at December 31, 2017 and 2016. See Item 1. Business - Lending Activities - Asset Quality\u201d of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's non-performing loans.\nDuring the second quarter of 2017, the Company sold $564.8 million of the MSA with a MSR book value of $4.8 million and generated an associated gain of $1.1 million. Under regulatory capital guidelines, MSAs are limited to 10% of the Bank's common equity Tier 1 capital. MSAs in excess of the 10% threshold must be deducted from common equity for regulatory capital purposes. The sale of this asset allows the Bank to remain below the maximum 10% regulatory capital limitation with the expectation that continued MSAs will be generated from future residential loan sales.\nLiabilities. Total liabilities increased $112.9 million, or 15.1%, to $859.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $746.9 million at December 31, 2016. Deposits increased $117.2 million, or 16.5% to $829.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $712.6 million at December 31, 2016. Relationship-based transactional accounts (noninterest-bearing checking, interest-bearing checking, and escrow accounts) increased $87.7 million, or 40.1%, to $306.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $219.0 million at December 31, 2016. Money market and savings accounts increased $3.0 million, or 1.0%, to $300.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $297.8 million at December 31, 2016. Time deposits increased $26.5 million, or 13.6%, to $222.3 million at December 31, 2017, from $195.7 million at December 31, 2016. Non-retail certificates of deposit which includes brokered certificates of deposit, online certificates of deposit, and public funds, increased $6.3 million, or 10.5%, to $66.5 million, at December 31, 2017, compared to $60.2 million at December 31, 2016. Management remains focused on growth in lower cost relationship-based deposits to fund long-term asset growth.\nAt December 31, 2017, borrowings decreased $5.1 million, or 40.6%, to $7.5 million from $12.7 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to the repayment of FHLB fixed rate advances.\nStockholders' Equity. Total stockholders' equity increased $41.0 million, or 50.6%, to $122.0 million at December 31, 2017, from $81.0 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in stockholders' equity was primarily from net proceeds of $25.6 million from an underwritten public offering completed in the third quarter of 2017 and net income of $14.1 million. Book value per common share was $34.47 at December 31, 2017, compared to $28.32 at December 31, 2016.\n\t\t\t \t\t\nAverage Balances, Interest and Average Yields/Cost\nThe following table sets forth for the periods indicated, information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest-earning assets and interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, resultant yields, interest rate spread, net interest margin (otherwise known as net yield on interest-earning assets), and the ratio of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities. Also presented is the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets, rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant spread at December 31, 2017. Income and all average balances are monthly average balances. Non-accruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.\n\n (1) The average loans receivable, net balances include non-accruing loans. \n\t\t\t \t\t\nRate/Volume Analysis\nThe following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It distinguishes between the changes related to outstanding balances and that due to the changes in interest rates. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (i.e., changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (ii) changes in rate (i.e., changes in rate multiplied by old volume). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.\n\n (1) The average loans receivable, net balances include non-accruing loans. \nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $3.6 million, or 34.2%, to $14.1 million, from $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net income was primarily a result of an $8.2 million, or 21.5% increase in interest income, a $1.7 million reduction in the provision for loan losses, and a $505,000, or 2.1% increase in noninterest income, partially offset by a $5.1 million, or 13.0% increase in noninterest expense, an $890,000, or 15.9% increase in the provision for income tax expense, and a $770,000, or 18.5% increase in interest expense.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income increased $7.4 million, or 21.8%, to $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to a $7.7 million, or 21.5% increase in loan receivable interest income resulting from a $130.6 million increase in average loans receivable, net and loans held for sale over the last year, and a $476,000, or 21.2% increase in interest and dividends on investment securities, and cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by a $770,000 or 18.5% increase in total interest expense.\nThe net interest margin ( NIM\u201d) increased 22 basis points to 4.65% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 4.43% for the same period last year. The increased NIM reflects continued growth in higher yielding loans, and reductions in securities AFS and cash and cash equivalents. The average cost of funds for total interest-bearing liabilities increased\ntwo basis points to 0.76% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 0.74% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Management remains focused on matching deposit duration with the duration of earning assets where appropriate.\nInterest Income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $8.2 million, or 21.5%, to $46.2 million, from $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase during the year was primarily attributable to an increase in the average balance of loans receivable, net and loans held for sale to $749.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $618.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and a 24 basis point increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets to 5.21% during the year ended December 31, 2017, from 4.97% for the prior year. The increase in average yield on interest-earning assets compared to the prior year primarily reflects the growth in the loan portfolio and the proportionally larger level of loans in the average interest-earning asset mix. The average yield on loans receivable, net and loans held for sale increased to 5.80% during the year ended December 31, 2017, from 5.78% for the prior year.\nThe following table compares average earning asset balances, associated yields, and resulting changes in interest income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\n (1) The average loans receivable, net balances include non-accruing loans. \nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $770,000, or 18.5%, to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $4.2 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense on deposits of $666,000, and an increase in interest on borrowings of $108,000. The average cost of funds for total interest-bearing liabilities increased two basis points to 0.76% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 0.74% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The average cost of deposits (excluding noninterest-bearing deposits) slightly increased two basis points to 0.50% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 0.48% for the year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting rising interest rates over the last year and the increase in non-retail certificates of deposit.\nThe following table details average balances for cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities and the change in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses was $750,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the provision was primarily a result of the relatively low levels of charge-offs, delinquencies, nonperforming and classified loans, as well as the increasing\npercentage of real estate loans compared to consumer loans and improving real estate values in our market areas reducing the increase in the provision for loan losses required for loan growth. Substandard loans decreased $1.6 million, or 19.3%, to $6.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $8.0 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in substandard loans from one year ago was primarily due to the sale of a $1.9 million shared national credit as discussed above. Non-performing loans increased to $1.0 million, or 0.1% of total gross loans at December 31, 2017, compared to $721,000, or 0.1% of total gross loans at December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net charge-offs totaled $205,000 compared to net recoveries of $26,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe following table details activity and information related to the allowance for loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nManagement considers the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2017, to be adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on the assessment of the above-mentioned factors affecting the loan portfolio. While management believes the estimates and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators, as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income increased $505,000, or 2.1%, to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The following table provides a detailed analysis of the changes in the components of noninterest income:\n\nThe increase during the period was primarily due to increases in gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights of $1.1 million, gain on sale of investment securities of $234,000 and increased service charges and fee income of $157,000, partially offset by a decrease in gain on sale of loans of $1.1 million. The gain on sale of loans included a reduction in the favorable fair-value adjustment on derivative financial instruments (commitments to extend credit, commitments to sell loans, mortgage backed securities trades and option contracts) and reflects a reduction of gain on sale margins associated with the product mix in the Pacific Northwest. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a net gain of $2.3\nmillion for changes in the valuation of derivatives carried at fair value, compared to a net gain of $3.1 for the year ended December 31, 2016, which are included in gain on sale of loans. These adjustments in fair value primarily reflect changes in loan volume and interest rate lock commitments issued as a result of subsequent changes in the level of market interest rates. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company originated $812.1 million of one-to-four-family consumer mortgages during 2017 and sold $698.6 million to secondary mortgage market investors, and $19.4 million to another financial institution, compared to sales of $711.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, the margin on loans sold decreased to 2.50% for the year ended December 31 2017, from 2.64% a year ago.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $5.1 million, or 13.0%, to $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The following table provides an analysis of the changes in the components of noninterest expense:\n\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company employed 326 full-time equivalent employees compared to 306 at December 31, 2016. Salaries and benefits increased $4.6 million, or 21.0%, which included $1.4 million of commissions and incentives for the loan production staff reflecting our increased loan production, as well as $593,000 of employee stock option plan expense due to the significant increase in our stock price over the last year. Other year over year changes in expenses include a $387,000, or 18.1% increase in data processing, a $268,000, or 11.1% increase in occupancy, a $205,000, or 3.4% increase in operations costs, and a $147,000, or 5.9% increase in loan costs, partially offset by a $389,000, or 100.0% decrease in acquisition costs, and a $246,000, or 12.7% decrease in professional and board fees. There was no gain on the sale of OREO in the current year to offset the increase in expenses as compared to $150,000 last year.\nThe efficiency ratio, which is noninterest expense as a percentage of net interest income and noninterest income, slightly improved to 67.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 67.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016. By definition, a lower efficiency ratio would be an indication that the Company is more efficiently utilizing resources to generate income.\nProvision for Income Tax. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provision for income tax expense of $6.5 million compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflecting both higher pre-tax income and a tax benefit recognized as a result of the Tax Act. The Tax Act required a revaluation the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate income tax rates and other provisions of the legislation. As a result of the Company's revaluation, the Company recognized $396,000 in tax benefit due to a net deferred tax liability position. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was a $607,000 and $1.2 million net deferred tax liability, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 31.6%, compared to 35.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016. For future periods, the Company will be using an estimated tax rate of 21.5% to\naccount for its federal and state income tax expense. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nAsset and Liability Management and Market Risk\nRisk When Interest Rates Change. The rates of interest the Company earns on assets and pays on liabilities generally is established contractually for a period of time. Market rates change over time. Like other financial institutions, the Company's results of operations are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of the Company's assets and liabilities. The risk associated with changes in interest rates and the Company's ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is the most significant market risk.\nHow The Company Measures Risk of Interest Rate Changes. As part of an attempt to manage exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations, the Company monitors interest rate risk. In doing so, the Company analyzes and manages assets and liabilities based on their interest rates and payment streams, timing of maturities, repricing opportunities, and sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates.\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and FHLB advances, reprice more rapidly or at different rates than the interest-earning assets. In order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material prolonged increases or decreases in interest rates on the Company's results of operations, the Company has adopted an Asset and Liability Management Policy. The Board of Directors sets the Asset and Liability Management Policy for the Bank, which is implemented by the asset/liability committee ( ALCO\u201d), an internal management committee. The board level oversight for ALCO is performed by the audit committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe purpose of the ALCO is to communicate, coordinate, and control asset/liability management consistent with the business plan and board-approved policies. The committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources, taking into account relative costs and spreads, interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs. The objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity, capital adequacy, growth, risk and profitability goals.\nThe committee generally meets monthly to, among other things, protect capital through earnings stability over the interest rate cycle; maintain the Bank's well capitalized status; and provide a reasonable return on investment. The committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review. The committee is responsible for reviewing and reporting the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the Board of Directors at least quarterly. The Chief Financial Officer oversees the process on a daily basis.\nA key element of the Bank's asset/liability management plan is to protect net earnings by managing the maturity or repricing mismatch between interest-earning assets and rate-sensitive liabilities. The Company seeks to accomplish this by extending funding maturities through wholesale funding sources, including the use of FHLB advances and brokered certificates of deposit, and through asset management, including the use of adjustable-rate loans and selling certain fixed-rate loans in the secondary market. Management is also focused on matching deposit duration with the duration of earning assets as appropriate.\nAs part of the efforts to monitor and manage interest rate risk, a number of indicators are used to monitor overall risk. Among the measurements are:\nMarket Risk. Market risk is the potential change in the value of investment securities if interest rates change. This change in value impacts the value of the Company and the liquidity of the securities. Market risk is controlled by setting a maximum average maturity/average life of the securities portfolio to 10 years.\nEconomic Risk. Economic risk is the risk that the underlying value of a bank will change when rates change. This can be caused by a change in value of the existing assets and liabilities (this is called Economic Value of Equity or EVE), or a change in the earnings stream (this is caused by interest rate risk). The Company takes economic risk primarily when fixed rate loans are made, or purchase fixed-rate investments, or issue long term certificates of deposit or take fixed-rate FHLB advances. It is the risk that interest rates will change and these fixed-rate assets and liabilities will change in value. This change in value usually is not recognized in the earnings, or equity (other than marking to market securities\navailable-for-sale or fair value adjustments on loans held for sale). The change is recognized only when the assets and liabilities are liquidated. Although the change in market value is usually not recognized in earnings or in capital, the impact is real to the long-term value of 1st Security Bank of Washington. Therefore, the Company will control the level of economic risk by limiting the amount of long-term, fixed-rate assets the Company will have and by setting a limit on concentrations and maturities of securities.\nInterest Rate Risk. If the Federal Reserve Board changes the Fed Funds rate 100, 200 or 300 basis points, the Bank policy dictates that a change in net interest income should not change more that 7.5%, 15% and 30%, respectively.\nThe table presented below, as of December 31, 2017, is an analysis prepared for 1st Security Bank of Washington by Olson Research Associates, Inc. utilizing various market and actual experience-based assumptions. The table represents a static shock to the net interest income using instantaneous and sustained shifts in the yield curve, in 100 basis point increments, up and down 100 basis points. No rates in the model are allowed to go below zero. Given the low interest rate environment, reduction in rates by 200 and 300 basis points are not reported. The results reflect a projected income statement with minimal exposure to instantaneous changes in interest rates. These results are primarily based upon historical prepayment speeds within the consumer lending portfolio in combination with the above average yields associated with the consumer portfolio if those prepayments do not occur. The current targeted Fed Funds rate is a range of 1.25 to 1.50% making a 200 and 300 basis point decrease impossible.\n\nIn managing the assets/liability mix the Company typically places an equal emphasis on maximizing net interest margin and matching the interest rate sensitivity of the assets and liabilities. From time to time, however, depending on the relationship between long- and short-term interest rates, market conditions and consumer preference, the Company may place somewhat greater emphasis on maximizing net interest margin than on strict dollar for dollar categories matching the interest rate sensitivity of the assets and liabilities. Management also believes that the increased net income which may result from a prepayment assumption denied mismatch in the actual maturity or repricing of the asset and liability portfolios can, during periods of changing interest rates, provide sufficient returns to justify the increased exposure to sudden and unexpected increases in interest rates which may result from such a mismatch. Management believes that 1st Security Bank of Washington's level of interest rate risk is acceptable under this approach.\nIn evaluating 1st Security Bank of Washington's exposure to interest rate movements, certain shortcomings inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing periods, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgages, have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a significant change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed above. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. 1st Security Bank of Washington considers all of these factors in monitoring its exposure to interest rate risk.\nLiquidity\nManagement maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit runoff that may occur in the normal course of business. The Company relies on a number of different sources in order to meet potential liquidity demands. The primary sources are increases in deposit accounts, FHLB advances,\npurchases of Fed Funds, sale of securities available-for-sale, cash flows from loan payments, sales of one-to-four-family loans held for sale, and maturing securities.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Bank's total borrowing capacity was $209.7 million with the FHLB of Des Moines, with unused borrowing capacity of $201.0 million at that date. The FHLB borrowing limit is based on certain categories of loans, primarily real estate loans that qualify as collateral for FHLB advances. At December 31, 2017, the Bank held approximately $318.5 million in loans that qualify as collateral for FHLB advances.\nIn addition to the availability of liquidity from the FHLB of Des Moines, the Bank maintained a short-term borrowing line with the Federal Reserve Bank, with a current limit of $99.1 million, and a combined credit limit of $43.0 million in written Fed Funds lines of credit through correspondent banking relationships as of December 31, 2017. The Federal Reserve Bank borrowing limit is based on certain categories of loans, primarily consumer loans that qualify as collateral for Federal Reserve Bank line of credit. At December 31, 2017, the Bank held approximately $203.3 million in loans that qualify as collateral for the Federal Reserve Bank line of credit.\nAt December 31, 2017, $7.5 million", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion and analysis reviews our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto that appear in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with these Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes and the business and financial information provided in this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nFS Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary bank, 1st Security Bank of Washington have been serving the Puget Sound area since 1936. Originally chartered as a credit union, previously known as Washington's Credit Union, the credit union served various select employment groups. On April 1, 2004, the credit union converted to a Washington state-chartered mutual savings bank. On July 9, 2012, the Bank converted from mutual to stock ownership and became the wholly owned subsidiary of FS Bancorp, Inc.\nThe Company is relationship-driven delivering banking and financial services to local families, local and regional businesses and industry niches within distinct Puget Sound area communities, and one loan production office located in the Tri-Cities, Washington. On January 22, 2016, the Company completed the previously announced Branch Purchase from Bank of America, N.A and acquired $186.4 million in deposits and $419,000 in loans based on financial information at that date. The four branches are located in the communities of Port Angeles, Sequim, Port Townsend, and Hadlock, Washington. The Branch Purchase expanded our Puget Sound-focused retail footprint onto the Olympic Peninsula and provided an opportunity to extend our unique brand of community banking into those communities.\nThe Company also maintains its long-standing indirect consumer lending platform which operates throughout the West Coast. The Company emphasizes long-term relationships with families and businesses within the communities served, working with them to meet their financial needs. The Company is actively involved in community activities and events within these market areas, which further strengthens our relationships within those markets.\nThe Company focuses on diversifying revenues, expanding lending channels, and growing the banking franchise. Management remains focused on building diversified revenue streams based upon credit, interest rate, and concentration risks. Our business plan remains as follows:\n \u00b7 Growing and diversifying our loan portfolio; \n \u00b7 Maintaining strong asset quality; \n \u00b7 Emphasizing lower cost core deposits to reduce the costs of funding our loan growth; \n \u00b7 Capturing our customers' full relationship by offering a wide range of products and services by leveraging our well-established involvement in our communities and by selectively emphasizing products and services designed to meet our customers' banking needs; and \n \u00b7 Expanding the Company's markets. \nThe Company is a diversified lender with a focus on the origination of indirect home improvement loans, also referred to as fixture secured loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans, home loans, commercial business loans and second mortgage/home equity loan products. Consumer loans, in particular indirect home improvement loans to finance window replacement, gutter replacement, siding replacement, solar panels, and other improvement renovations, is a large portion of the loan portfolio and have traditionally been the mainstay of our lending strategy. At December 31, 2017, consumer loans represented 27.0% of the Company's total gross loan portfolio, down from 28.9% at December 31, 2016, as real estate loan originations have increased at a faster pace than consumer loan originations during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIndirect home improvement lending is dependent on the Bank's relationships with home improvement contractors and dealers. The Company funded $92.8 million, or approximately 6,000 loans during the year ended December 31, 2017,\nusing its indirect home improvement contractor/dealer network located throughout Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, and Colorado with six contractor/dealers responsible for 56.7% of the funded loans dollar volume. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, continuing and growing relationships with home improvement contractors and dealers\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nSince 2012, the Company has had an emphasis on diversifying lending products by expanding commercial real estate, commercial business and residential lending, while maintaining the current size of the consumer loan portfolio. The Company's lending strategies are intended to take advantage of: (1) historical strength in indirect consumer lending, (2) recent market consolidation that has created new lending opportunities and the availability of experienced bankers, and (3) strength in relationship lending. Retail deposits will continue to serve as an important funding source. See Item 1. Business: Lending Activities\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nRecently, improvements in the economy, employment rates, stronger real estate prices, and a general lack of new housing inventory has resulted in our significantly increasing originations of construction loans for properties located in our market areas. We anticipate that construction and development lending will continue to be a strong element of our total loan portfolio in future periods. We will continue to take a disciplined approach in our construction and development lending by concentrating our efforts on loans to builders and developers in our market areas known to us. Originations of construction and development loans increased to $123.3 million in 2017 from $73.7 million in 2016. These short term loans typically mature in six to twelve months. In addition, the funding is usually not fully disbursed at origination, thereby reducing our net loans receivable in the short term. At December 31, 2017, outstanding construction and development loans totaled $143.1 million, or 18.5%, of the gross loan portfolio and consisted of loans for residential and commercial construction projects, primarily for vertical construction and $11.5 million of land acquisition and development loans. Total committed, including unfunded construction and development loans at December 31, 2017, was $222.0 million as compared to $154.3 million at December 31, 2016.\nThe Company is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions, as well as government policies and regulations concerning, among other things, monetary and fiscal affairs. Deposit flows are influenced by a number of factors, including interest rates paid on time deposits, other investments, account maturities, and the overall level of personal income and savings. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for funds, the number and quality of lenders, and regional economic cycles. Sources of funds for lending activities include primarily deposits, including brokered deposits, borrowings, payments on loans and income provided from operations.\nThe Company's earnings are primarily dependent upon net interest income, the difference between interest income and interest expense. Interest income is a function of the balances of loans and investments outstanding during a given period and the yield earned on these loans and investments. Interest expense is a function of the amount of deposits and borrowings outstanding during the same period and interest rates paid on these deposits and borrowings. Another significant influence on the Company's earnings is fee income from mortgage banking activities. The Company's earnings are also affected by the provision for loan losses, service charges and fees, gains from sales of assets, operating expenses and income taxes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCertain of the Company's accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. Management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses, the fair value of servicing rights, derivatives and hedging activity, and the accounting for deferred income taxes. The Company's accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nAllowance for Loan Loss. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. A high degree of judgment is necessary when determining the\namount of the allowance for loan losses. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are: loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans; value of collateral; and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of the allowance at least quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although the Company believes that use of the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. As the Company adds new products to the loan portfolio and expands the Company's market area, management intends to enhance and adapt the methodology to keep pace with the increased size and complexity of the loan portfolio. Changes in any of the above factors could have a significant effect on the calculation of the allowance for loan losses in any given period. Management believes that its systematic methodology continues to be appropriate given the Company's increased size and level of complexity.\nServicing Rights. Servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through the purchase or through the sale of financial assets. Generally, purchased servicing rights are capitalized at the cost to acquire the rights. For sales of mortgage, commercial and consumer loans, a portion of the cost of originating the loan is allocated to the servicing right based on relative fair value. Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage, commercial, or consumer servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as the cost to service, the discount rate, the custodial earnings rate, an inflation rate, ancillary income, prepayment speeds, and default rates and losses. Servicing assets are evaluated quarterly for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into tranches based on predominant characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type, and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual tranche, to the extent that fair value is less than the capitalized amount for the tranches. If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular tranche, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as a recovery and an increase to income. Capitalized servicing rights are stated separately on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized into noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets.\nDerivative and Hedging Activity. ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d requires that derivatives of the Company be recorded in the consolidated financial statements at fair value. Management considers its accounting policy for derivatives to be a critical accounting policy because these instruments have certain interest rate risk characteristics that change in value based upon changes in the capital markets. The Company's derivatives are primarily the result of its mortgage banking activities in the form of commitments to extend credit, commitments to sell loans, To-Be-Announced ( TBA\u201d) mortgage backed securities trades and option contracts to mitigate the risk of the commitments to extend credit. Estimates of the percentage of commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale that may not fund are based upon historical data and current market trends. The fair value adjustments of the derivatives are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income with offsets to other assets or other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIncome Taxes. Income taxes are reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements to show the tax effects of the operations and transactions reported in the consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently payable plus deferred taxes. Accounting Standards Codification, ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes,\u201d requires the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. They are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled and are determined using the assets and liability method of accounting. The deferred income provision represents the difference between net deferred tax asset/liability at the beginning and end of the reported period. In formulating the deferred tax asset, the Company is required to estimate income and taxes in the jurisdiction in which the Company operates. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure for the reported period together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation and the provision for loan losses, for tax and financial reporting purposes.\nDeferred tax liabilities occur when taxable income is smaller than reported income on the income statements due to accounting valuation methods that differ from tax, as well as tax rate estimates and payments made quarterly and\nadjusted to actual at the end of the year. Deferred tax liabilities are temporary differences payable in future periods. The Company had a net deferred tax liability of $607,000, and $1.2 million, at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur Business and Operating Strategy and Goals\nThe Company's primary objective is to operate 1st Security Bank of Washington as a well capitalized, profitable, independent, community-oriented financial institution, serving customers in its primary market area defined generally as the greater Puget Sound market area. The Company's strategy is to provide innovative products and superior customer service to small businesses, industry and geographic niches, and individuals located in its primary market area. Services are currently provided to communities through the main office and 11 full-service bank branches, and are supported with 24/7 access to on-line banking and participation in a worldwide ATM network.\nThe Company focuses on diversifying revenues, expanding lending channels, and growing the banking franchise. Management remains focused on building diversified revenue streams based upon credit, interest rate, and concentration risks. The Board of Directors seeks to accomplish the Company's objectives through the adoption of a strategy designed to improve profitability and maintain a strong capital position and high asset quality. This strategy primarily involves:\nGrowing and diversifying the loan portfolio and revenue streams. The Company is transitioning lending activities from a predominantly consumer-driven model to a more diversified consumer and business model by emphasizing three key lending initiatives: expansion of commercial business lending programs, increasing in-house originations of residential mortgage loans primarily for sale into the secondary market through the mortgage banking program; and commercial real estate lending. Additionally, the Company seeks to diversify the loan portfolio by increasing lending to small businesses in the market area, as well as residential construction lending.\nMaintaining strong asset quality. The Company believes that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. The percentage of non-performing loans to total gross loans and the percentage of non-performing assets to total assets were each unchanged at 0.1% for both December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company has actively managed the delinquent loans and non-performing assets by aggressively pursuing the collection of consumer debts and marketing saleable properties upon which were foreclosed or repossessed, work-outs of classified assets and loan charge-offs. In the past several years, the Company also began emphasizing consumer loan originations to borrowers with higher credit scores, generally credit scores over 720 (although the policy allows us to go lower), which has led to lower charge-offs in recent periods. Although the Company plans to place more emphasis on certain lending products, such as commercial and multi-family real estate loans, construction and development loans, including speculative residential construction loans, and commercial business loans, while growing the current size of the one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans and the consumer loan portfolios, the Company continues to manage its credit exposures through the use of experienced bankers and an overall conservative approach to lending.\nEmphasizing lower cost core deposits to reduce the costs of funding loan growth. The Company offers personal and business checking accounts, NOW accounts and savings and money market accounts, which generally are lower-cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit, and are less sensitive to withdrawal when interest rates fluctuate. In order to build a core deposit base, the Company is pursuing a number of strategies. First, a diligent attempt to recruit all commercial loan customers to maintain a deposit relationship with the Company, generally a business checking account relationship to the extent practicable, for the term of their loan. Second, interest rate promotions are provided on savings and checking accounts from time to time to encourage the growth of these types of deposits. Third, by hiring experienced personnel with relationships in the communities we serve.\nCapturing customers' full relationship. The Company offers a wide range of products and services that provide diversification of revenue sources and solidify the relationship with the Bank's customers. The Company focuses on core retail and business deposits, including savings and checking accounts, that lead to long-term customer retention. As part of the commercial lending process cross-selling the entire business banking relationship, including deposit relationships and business banking products, such as online cash management, treasury management, wires, direct deposit, payment processing and remote deposit capture. The Company's mortgage banking program also provides opportunities to cross-sell products to new customers.\nExpanding the Company's markets. In addition to deepening relationships with existing customers, the Company intends to expand business to new customers by leveraging the Company's well-established involvement in the community and by selectively emphasizing products and services designed to meet their banking needs. The Company also intends to pursue expansion in other market areas through selective growth of the home lending network. As an example, through the Branch Purchase, the Company expanded its retail market area onto the Olympic Peninsula into the communities of Port Angeles, Sequim, Port Townsend, and Hadlock, Washington. See Note 2 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nAssets. Total assets increased $153.9 million, or 18.6%, to $981.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $827.9 million at December 31, 2016, primarily the result of an increase in loans receivable, net of $168.2 million, certificates of deposit at other financial institutions of $2.9 million, accrued interest of $1.0 million, and loans held for sale of $910,000, partially offset by a decrease in total cash and cash equivalents of $17.5 million and servicing rights of $1.7 million. The increase in assets was primarily funded by growth in deposits and net proceeds from an underwritten public offering completed in the third quarter of 2017.\nLoans receivable, net, increased $168.2 million, or 28.4%, to $761.6 million at December 31, 2017, from $593.3 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in loans receivable, net was primarily a result of a $108.1 million increase in total real estate loans, including increases in one-to-four-family loans of $39.6 million, multi-family loans of $6.9 million, construction and development loans of $48.6 million, commercial real estate loans of $7.7 million, and home equity loans of $5.2 million, as well as increases in commercial business loans of $26.0 million, and consumer loans of $33.9 million.\nLoans held for sale, consisting of one-to-four-family loans, increased by $910,000, or 1.7%, to $53.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $52.6 million for the prior year due to the increase in fair value and the timing difference between loan fundings and loan sale settlements. The Company continues to expand its home lending operations by hiring additional lending staff and will continue selling one-to-four-family mortgage loans into the secondary market for asset/liability management purposes.\nOne-to-four-family originations, including $698.5 million loans held for sale, $105.2 million portfolio loans including first and second liens, and $8.4 million loans brokered to other institutions, increased 4.1% to $812.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $779.8 million for the prior year. The growth in originations was a result of increased purchase activity associated with the strong home purchase demand in the Pacific Northwest. Originations of one-to-four-family loans to purchase a home (purchase production) increased by $109.1 million, or 21.2% with $624.3 million in loan purchase production closing during the year ended December 31, 2017, up from $515.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. One-to-four-family loan originations for refinance (refinance production) decreased $77.5 million, or 29.3% with $186.9 million in refinance production closing during the year ended December 31, 2017, down from $264.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe allowance for loan losses ( ALLL\u201d) at December 31, 2017 was $10.8 million, or 1.4% of gross loans receivable, excluding loans held for sale, compared to $10.2 million, or 1.7% of gross loans receivable, excluding loans held for sale, at December 31, 2016. Substandard loans decreased $1.6 million, or 19.3%, to $6.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $8.0 million at December 31, 2016. The $1.6 million decrease in substandard loans was primarily due to the sale of a $1.9 million shared national credit with a slight discount to book value charged off against the ALLL in the third quarter of 2017. Non-performing loans, consisting solely of non-accruing loans, increased $318,000, or 44.1%, to $1.0 million at December 31, 2017, from $721,000 at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, non-performing loans consisted of $551,000 of commercial business loans, $293,000 of residential real estate loans, and $195,000 of consumer loans.\nNon-performing loans to total gross loans were unchanged at 0.1% at both December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. There was no other real estate owned at December 31, 2017 and 2016. See Item 1. Business - Lending Activities - Asset Quality\u201d of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's non-performing loans.\nDuring the second quarter of 2017, the Company sold $564.8 million of the MSA with a MSR book value of $4.8 million and generated an associated gain of $1.1 million. Under regulatory capital guidelines, MSAs are limited to 10% of the Bank's common equity Tier 1 capital. MSAs in excess of the 10% threshold must be deducted from common equity for regulatory capital purposes. The sale of this asset allows the Bank to remain below the maximum 10% regulatory capital limitation with the expectation that continued MSAs will be generated from future residential loan sales.\nLiabilities. Total liabilities increased $112.9 million, or 15.1%, to $859.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $746.9 million at December 31, 2016. Deposits increased $117.2 million, or 16.5% to $829.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $712.6 million at December 31, 2016. Relationship-based transactional accounts (noninterest-bearing checking, interest-bearing checking, and escrow accounts) increased $87.7 million, or 40.1%, to $306.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $219.0 million at December 31, 2016. Money market and savings accounts increased $3.0 million, or 1.0%, to $300.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $297.8 million at December 31, 2016. Time deposits increased $26.5 million, or 13.6%, to $222.3 million at December 31, 2017, from $195.7 million at December 31, 2016. Non-retail certificates of deposit which includes brokered certificates of deposit, online certificates of deposit, and public funds, increased $6.3 million, or 10.5%, to $66.5 million, at December 31, 2017, compared to $60.2 million at December 31, 2016. Management remains focused on growth in lower cost relationship-based deposits to fund long-term asset growth.\nAt December 31, 2017, borrowings decreased $5.1 million, or 40.6%, to $7.5 million from $12.7 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to the repayment of FHLB fixed rate advances.\nStockholders' Equity. Total stockholders' equity increased $41.0 million, or 50.6%, to $122.0 million at December 31, 2017, from $81.0 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in stockholders' equity was primarily from net proceeds of $25.6 million from an underwritten public offering completed in the third quarter of 2017 and net income of $14.1 million. Book value per common share was $34.47 at December 31, 2017, compared to $28.32 at December 31, 2016.\n\t\t\t \t\t\nAverage Balances, Interest and Average Yields/Cost\nThe following table sets forth for the periods indicated, information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest-earning assets and interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, resultant yields, interest rate spread, net interest margin (otherwise known as net yield on interest-earning assets), and the ratio of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities. Also presented is the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets, rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant spread at December 31, 2017. Income and all average balances are monthly average balances. Non-accruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $3.6 million, or 34.2%, to $14.1 million, from $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net income was primarily a result of an $8.2 million, or 21.5% increase in interest income, a $1.7 million reduction in the provision for loan losses, and a $505,000, or 2.1% increase in noninterest income, partially offset by a $5.1 million, or 13.0% increase in noninterest expense, an $890,000, or 15.9% increase in the provision for income tax expense, and a $770,000, or 18.5% increase in interest expense.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income increased $7.4 million, or 21.8%, to $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to a $7.7 million, or 21.5% increase in loan receivable interest income resulting from a $130.6 million increase in average loans receivable, net and loans held for sale over the last year, and a $476,000, or 21.2% increase in interest and dividends on investment securities, and cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by a $770,000 or 18.5% increase in total interest expense.\nThe net interest margin ( NIM\u201d) increased 22 basis points to 4.65% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 4.43% for the same period last year. The increased NIM reflects continued growth in higher yielding loans, and reductions in securities AFS and cash and cash equivalents. The average cost of funds for total interest-bearing liabilities increased\ntwo basis points to 0.76% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 0.74% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Management remains focused on matching deposit duration with the duration of earning assets where appropriate.\nInterest Income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $8.2 million, or 21.5%, to $46.2 million, from $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase during the year was primarily attributable to an increase in the average balance of loans receivable, net and loans held for sale to $749.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $618.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and a 24 basis point increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets to 5.21% during the year ended December 31, 2017, from 4.97% for the prior year. The increase in average yield on interest-earning assets compared to the prior year primarily reflects the growth in the loan portfolio and the proportionally larger level of loans in the average interest-earning asset mix. The average yield on loans receivable, net and loans held for sale increased to 5.80% during the year ended December 31, 2017, from 5.78% for the prior year.\nThe following table compares average earning asset balances, associated yields, and resulting changes in interest income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease in\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOutstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield/Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOutstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield/Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncome\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoans receivable, net and loans held for sale (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n749,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.80\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n618,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.78\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,685\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFHLB stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest-bearing deposits at other financial institutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n64,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal interest-earning assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n886,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.21\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n764,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.97\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,161\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The average loans receivable, net balances include non-accruing loans. \nInterest Expense.

The average cost of deposits (excluding noninterest-bearing deposits) slightly increased two basis points to 0.50% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 0.48% for the year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting rising interest rates over the last year and the increase in non-retail certificates of deposit.\nThe following table details average balances for cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities and the change in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Decrease) in\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOutstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOutstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSavings and money market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n315,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.40\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n280,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.36\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest-bearing checking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n88,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n53,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCertificates of deposit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n207,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n192,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBorrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSubordinated note\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n647,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.76\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n562,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.74\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses was $750,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the provision was primarily a result of the relatively low levels of charge-offs, delinquencies, nonperforming and classified loans, as well as the increasing\npercentage of real estate loans compared to consumer loans and improving real estate values in our market areas reducing the increase in the provision for loan losses required for loan growth. Substandard loans decreased $1.6 million, or 19.3%, to $6.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $8.0 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in substandard loans from one year ago was primarily due to the sale of a $1.9 million shared national credit as discussed above. Non-performing loans increased to $1.0 million, or 0.1% of total gross loans at December 31, 2017, compared to $721,000, or 0.1% of total gross loans at December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net charge-offs totaled $205,000 compared to net recoveries of $26,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe following table details activity and information related to the allowance for loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAt or For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet charge-offs (recoveries)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(26)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAllowance for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAllowance for loan losses as a percentage of total gross loans receivable at the end of the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-accrual and 90 days or more past due loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAllowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-performing loans at end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,035.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,416.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-accrual and 90 days or more past due loans as a percentage of gross loans receivable at the end of the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal gross loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n773,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n605,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement considers the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2017, to be adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on the assessment of the above-mentioned factors affecting the loan portfolio. While management believes the estimates and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators, as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income increased $505,000, or 2.1%, to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

The gain on sale of loans included a reduction in the favorable fair-value adjustment on derivative financial instruments (commitments to extend credit, commitments to sell loans, mortgage backed securities trades and option contracts) and reflects a reduction of gain on sale margins associated with the product mix in the Pacific Northwest. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a net gain of $2.3\nmillion for changes in the valuation of derivatives carried at fair value, compared to a net gain of $3.1 for the year ended December 31, 2016, which are included in gain on sale of loans. These adjustments in fair value primarily reflect changes in loan volume and interest rate lock commitments issued as a result of subsequent changes in the level of market interest rates. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company originated $812.1 million of one-to-four-family consumer mortgages during 2017 and sold $698.6 million to secondary mortgage market investors, and $19.4 million to another financial institution, compared to sales of $711.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, the margin on loans sold decreased to 2.50% for the year ended December 31 2017, from 2.64% a year ago.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $5.1 million, or 13.0%, to $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Salaries and benefits increased $4.6 million, or 21.0%, which included $1.4 million of commissions and incentives for the loan production staff reflecting our increased loan production, as well as $593,000 of employee stock option plan expense due to the significant increase in our stock price over the last year. Other year over year changes in expenses include a $387,000, or 18.1% increase in data processing, a $268,000, or 11.1% increase in occupancy, a $205,000, or 3.4% increase in operations costs, and a $147,000, or 5.9% increase in loan costs, partially offset by a $389,000, or 100.0% decrease in acquisition costs, and a $246,000, or 12.7% decrease in professional and board fees. There was no gain on the sale of OREO in the current year to offset the increase in expenses as compared to $150,000 last year.\nThe efficiency ratio, which is noninterest expense as a percentage of net interest income and noninterest income, slightly improved to 67.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 67.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016. By definition, a lower efficiency ratio would be an indication that the Company is more efficiently utilizing resources to generate income.\nProvision for Income Tax. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provision for income tax expense of $6.5 million compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflecting both higher pre-tax income and a tax benefit recognized as a result of the Tax Act. The Tax Act required a revaluation the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate income tax rates and other provisions of the legislation. As a result of the Company's revaluation, the Company recognized $396,000 in tax benefit due to a net deferred tax liability position. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was a $607,000 and $1.2 million net deferred tax liability, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 31.6%, compared to 35.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016. For future periods, the Company will be using an estimated tax rate of 21.5% to\naccount for its federal and state income tax expense. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nAsset and Liability Management and Market Risk\nRisk When Interest Rates Change. The rates of interest the Company earns on assets and pays on liabilities generally is established contractually for a period of time. Market rates change over time. Like other financial institutions, the Company's results of operations are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of the Company's assets and liabilities. The risk associated with changes in interest rates and the Company's ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is the most significant market risk.\nHow The Company Measures Risk of Interest Rate Changes. As part of an attempt to manage exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations, the Company monitors interest rate risk. In doing so, the Company analyzes and manages assets and liabilities based on their interest rates and payment streams, timing of maturities, repricing opportunities, and sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates.\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and FHLB advances, reprice more rapidly or at different rates than the interest-earning assets. In order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material prolonged increases or decreases in interest rates on the Company's results of operations, the Company has adopted an Asset and Liability Management Policy. The Board of Directors sets the Asset and Liability Management Policy for the Bank, which is implemented by the asset/liability committee ( ALCO\u201d), an internal management committee. The board level oversight for ALCO is performed by the audit committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe purpose of the ALCO is to communicate, coordinate, and control asset/liability management consistent with the business plan and board-approved policies. The committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources, taking into account relative costs and spreads, interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs. The objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity, capital adequacy, growth, risk and profitability goals.\nThe committee generally meets monthly to, among other things, protect capital through earnings stability over the interest rate cycle; maintain the Bank's well capitalized status; and provide a reasonable return on investment. The committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review. The committee is responsible for reviewing and reporting the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the Board of Directors at least quarterly. The Chief Financial Officer oversees the process on a daily basis.\nA key element of the Bank's asset/liability management plan is to protect net earnings by managing the maturity or repricing mismatch between interest-earning assets and rate-sensitive liabilities. The Company seeks to accomplish this by extending funding maturities through wholesale funding sources, including the use of FHLB advances and brokered certificates of deposit, and through asset management, including the use of adjustable-rate loans and selling certain fixed-rate loans in the secondary market. Management is also focused on matching deposit duration with the duration of earning assets as appropriate.\nAs part of the efforts to monitor and manage interest rate risk, a number of indicators are used to monitor overall risk. Among the measurements are:\nMarket Risk. Market risk is the potential change in the value of investment securities if interest rates change. This change in value impacts the value of the Company and the liquidity of the securities. Market risk is controlled by setting a maximum average maturity/average life of the securities portfolio to 10 years.\nEconomic Risk. Economic risk is the risk that the underlying value of a bank will change when rates change. This can be caused by a change in value of the existing assets and liabilities (this is called Economic Value of Equity or EVE), or a change in the earnings stream (this is caused by interest rate risk). The Company takes economic risk primarily when fixed rate loans are made, or purchase fixed-rate investments, or issue long term certificates of deposit or take fixed-rate FHLB advances. It is the risk that interest rates will change and these fixed-rate assets and liabilities will change in value. This change in value usually is not recognized in the earnings, or equity (other than marking to market securities\navailable-for-sale or fair value adjustments on loans held for sale). The change is recognized only when the assets and liabilities are liquidated. Although the change in market value is usually not recognized in earnings or in capital, the impact is real to the long-term value of 1st Security Bank of Washington. Therefore, the Company will control the level of economic risk by limiting the amount of long-term, fixed-rate assets the Company will have and by setting a limit on concentrations and maturities of securities.\nInterest Rate Risk. If the Federal Reserve Board changes the Fed Funds rate 100, 200 or 300 basis points, the Bank policy dictates that a change in net interest income should not change more that 7.5%, 15% and 30%, respectively.\nThe table presented below, as of December 31, 2017, is an analysis prepared for 1st Security Bank of Washington by Olson Research Associates, Inc. utilizing various market and actual experience-based assumptions. The table represents a static shock to the net interest income using instantaneous and sustained shifts in the yield curve, in 100 basis point increments, up and down 100 basis points. No rates in the model are allowed to go below zero. Given the low interest rate environment, reduction in rates by 200 and 300 basis points are not reported. The results reflect a projected income statement with minimal exposure to instantaneous changes in interest rates. These results are primarily based upon historical prepayment speeds within the consumer lending portfolio in combination with the above average yields associated with the consumer portfolio if those prepayments do not occur. The current targeted Fed Funds rate is a range of 1.25 to 1.50% making a 200 and 300 basis point decrease impossible.\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRates in Basis Points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n300bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n45,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.36\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n200bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n100bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n44,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n0bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n43,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(100)bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n42,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,854)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.23)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn managing the assets/liability mix the Company typically places an equal emphasis on maximizing net interest margin and matching the interest rate sensitivity of the assets and liabilities. From time to time, however, depending on the relationship between long- and short-term interest rates, market conditions and consumer preference, the Company may place somewhat greater emphasis on maximizing net interest margin than on strict dollar for dollar categories matching the interest rate sensitivity of the assets and liabilities. Management also believes that the increased net income which may result from a prepayment assumption denied mismatch in the actual maturity or repricing of the asset and liability portfolios can, during periods of changing interest rates, provide sufficient returns to justify the increased exposure to sudden and unexpected increases in interest rates which may result from such a mismatch. Management believes that 1st Security Bank of Washington's level of interest rate risk is acceptable under this approach.\nIn evaluating 1st Security Bank of Washington's exposure to interest rate movements, certain shortcomings inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing periods, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgages, have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a significant change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed above. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. 1st Security Bank of Washington considers all of these factors in monitoring its exposure to interest rate risk.\nLiquidity\nManagement maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit runoff that may occur in the normal course of business. The Company relies on a number of different sources in order to meet potential liquidity demands. The primary sources are increases in deposit accounts, FHLB advances,\npurchases of Fed Funds, sale of securities available-for-sale, cash flows from loan payments, sales of one-to-four-family loans held for sale, and maturing securities.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Bank's total borrowing capacity was $209.7 million with the FHLB of Des Moines, with unused borrowing capacity of $201.0 million at that date. The FHLB borrowing limit is based on certain categories of loans, primarily real estate loans that qualify as collateral for FHLB advances. At December 31, 2017, the Bank held approximately $318.5 million in loans that qualify as collateral for FHLB advances.\nIn addition to the availability of liquidity from the FHLB of Des Moines, the Bank maintained a short-term borrowing line with the Federal Reserve Bank, with a current limit of $99.1 million, and a combined credit limit of $43.0 million in written Fed Funds lines of credit through correspondent banking relationships as of December 31, 2017. The Federal Reserve Bank borrowing limit is based on certain categories of loans, primarily consumer loans that qualify as collateral for Federal Reserve Bank line of credit. At December 31, 2017, the Bank held approximately $203.3 million in loans that qualify as collateral for the Federal Reserve Bank line of credit.\nAt December 31, 2017, $7.5 million"}
