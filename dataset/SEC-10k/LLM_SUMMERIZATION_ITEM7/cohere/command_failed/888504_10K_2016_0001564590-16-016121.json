Such statements may include, but are not limited to, statements of plans and objectives, statements of future economic performance and statements of assumptions underlying such statements, and statements of management's intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future. Forward-looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as should,\u201d intended,\u201d continue,\u201d believe,\u201d may,\u201d hope,\u201d anticipate,\u201d goal,\u201d forecast,\u201d plan,\u201d estimate\u201d and similar words or phrases. Such statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including but not limited to: prevailing prices for various commodities (including gold, copper, crude oil and natural gas), the duration of the current slowdown in the mineral drilling services market, unanticipated slowdowns in Layne's major markets, the availability of credit, the risks and uncertainties normally incident to the construction industry, the timing for the completion of the existing unprofitable contracts in Heavy Civil, the impact of competition, the effectiveness of operational changes expected to increase efficiency and productivity and reduce costs, worldwide economic and political conditions and foreign currency fluctuations that may affect worldwide results of operations. Many of the factors that will determine these items are beyond Layne's ability to control or predict. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially and adversely from those anticipated, estimated or projected. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this filing, and Layne assumes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand Layne, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report. MD&A includes the following sections:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Business-a general description of our business and key fiscal year 2016 events.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Consolidated Review of Operations-an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in the consolidated financial statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Operating Segment Review of Operations-an analysis of our results of operations for the three years presented in the consolidated financial statements for our reporting segments: Water Resources, Inliner, Heavy Civil and Mineral Services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Liquidity and Capital Resources-an analysis of cash flows, aggregate financial commitments and certain financial condition ratios.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates that involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBusiness\nLayne is a global water management, construction and drilling company. We provide responsible solutions for water, mineral and energy challenges. We manage and report our operations through four segments: Water Resources, Inliner, Heavy Civil and Mineral Services.\nKey Fiscal Year 2016 Events\nOn March 2, 2015, we completed the offering of approximately $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.0% Convertible Notes. The 8.0% Convertible Notes were offered at par to certain investors that held approximately $55.5 million of our 4.25% Convertible Notes pursuant to terms in which the investors agreed to (i) exchange the 4.25% Convertible Notes owned by them for approximately $49.9 million of the 8.0% Convertible Notes and (ii) purchase approximately $49.9 million aggregate principal amount of 8.0% Convertible Notes at a cash price equal to the principal amount thereof. We received net cash proceeds from the issuance of 8.0% Convertible Notes, net of expenses related to the offering of approximately $45.0 million. We used a portion of the net cash proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our asset-based credit facility, with the remainder of the net cash proceeds held for general working capital purposes. See Part II, Item 7 - Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information.\nMineral Services continues to be impacted by the global slowdown in spending for mineral drilling services, both in the markets served by our wholly-owned operations and our Latin American affiliates. Global spending for minerals drilling services has decreased significantly over the past three years in every geographic region. This has reduced the revenues generated by Mineral Services and has adversely affected our results of operations and cash flows. During FY2016, in response to continuing decline in the global minerals market, we implemented a plan to exit our operations in Africa and Australia. The restructuring, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of FY2017, was designed to optimize our cost structure, and involved a reduction in workforce and the disposition of assets.\nOn May 20, 2015, we signed a definitive agreement to sell our Geoconstruction business. The transaction closed on August 17, 2015 for total consideration of $42.3 million, including the preliminary estimate of the business segment's working capital which was subject to a post-closing reconciliation. After post-closing adjustments, the total purchase price increased to $47.7 million, to adjust for our estimated share in the profits of one of the contracts being assumed by the buyer and final working capital adjustments. We expect to use the net proceeds from the sale for general corporate purposes and growth opportunities in our core businesses. The disposition is discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConcurrent with the closing of the sale of the Geoconstruction business segment on August 17, 2015, our existing asset-based facility was amended to, among other things: (1) reduce the maximum amount that may be borrowed under the asset-based facility from $120.0 million to $100.0 million; (2) eliminate the $15.0 million Availability Block (as defined in the asset-based facility agreement); (3) reduce Minimum Excess Availability from $25.0 million to $17.5 million; (4) revise the borrowing base calculation; and (5) increase the annual commitment fee on unused commitments from 0.50% to 0.75%.\nDuring the third quarter of FY2016, we realigned our operating structure by combining the Energy Services segment with the Water Resources segment. This segment realignment is expected to increase efficiencies both in terms of asset management and operations.\nWe appointed J. Michael Anderson as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective July 20, 2015. Mr. Anderson brings more than 25 years of experience in senior management roles at publicly-traded companies in the water and energy industries, and in commercial and investment banking.\nEffective November 9, 2015, we appointed Jami M. Phillips as the principal accounting officer. Ms. Phillips has worked for us in various finance positions since 2013, and has served as our Controller since October 9, 2014. Prior to working for us, Ms. Phillips worked for CBIZ, Inc., a financial services company from 2010 to 2013.\nConsolidated Review of Operations\nThe following table, which is derived from our

The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower revenues at Mineral Services and Heavy Civil, partially offset by increases in revenues at Water Resources and Inliner.\nCost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and impairment charges) decreased $40.8 million, to $570.1 million (83.5% of revenues) for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $610.8 million (84.8% of revenues) for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. Cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 included a $7.9 million (1.2% of revenues) write-down of inventory as part of our restructuring activities in Africa and Australia. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 decreased from the prior year, primarily due to improved margins in Heavy Civil and Water Resources.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $8.9 million, or 7.6%, to $108.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $117.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The decreases were primarily due to overall effort to reduce overhead costs, including reductions in consulting expenses, compensation expenses due to the FY2015 Restructuring Plan, relocation costs, and office rent.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $9.3 million, or 22.1%, to $32.7 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $42.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to reductions in capital expenditures over the past several years, disposal of underutilized assets, and impairment of certain fixed assets during the current fiscal year.\nAn asset impairment charge of $4.6 million was recorded during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 for the Energy Services segment, which was previously reported as a separate segment prior to being combined with Water Resources segment beginning in the third quarter of FY2016. The impairment charge was recorded to reflect reductions in the estimated fair value of certain long-lived assets.\nRestructuring costs of $10.0 million were recorded for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $2.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, restructuring costs related to a $3.9 million asset write-down, combined with $6.1 million of severance and other costs, as part of the restructuring activities in Africa and Australia.\nRestructuring costs for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 primarily consisted of severance and other related costs associated with the FY2015 Restructuring Plan.\nEquity in losses of affiliates decreased $1.4 million, or 69.4%, to $0.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $2.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015.\nA gain on extinguishment of debt of $4.2 million was recognized during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 in connection with the partial redemption of the 4.25% Convertible Notes in exchange for 8.0% Convertible Notes, as discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest expense increased $4.3 million, or 31.4%, to $18.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $13.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The increase in interest expense was mainly due to a higher debt balance and higher average interest rate with the issuance of the 8.0% Convertible Notes during the first quarter of FY2016.\nIncome tax benefit from continuing operations of $1.6 million was recorded for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $3.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The FY2016 tax benefit included $3.6 million of benefit recorded as an offset to an equal amount of tax expense in discontinued operations less $2.0 million of tax expense relating to other items in continuing operations. The FY2015 tax benefit was primarily due to the carryback of prior year tax losses upon which no tax benefit had previously been recorded. A cash refund of $3.9 million was received in early FY2016.\nThe result of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 included net income from discontinued operations of $8.1 million, primarily related to the gain on the sale of our Geoconstruction business. A net loss from discontinued operations of $46.9 million was recorded for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, primarily related to operating losses of the Geoconstruction business segment and the loss on the sale of Costa Fortuna and Tecniwell businesses, both included in the Geoconstruction business segment.\nOperating Segment Review of Operations\nWater Resources\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 227,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 216,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from continuing operations before\nincome taxes as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,471\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,530\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment charges, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,598\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring costs, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (524\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues for Water Resources increased $11.1 million, or 5.1%, to $227.5 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $216.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The revenue growth in Water Resources was driven mainly by drilling projects in the western portion of the U.S. related to lingering drought conditions. The revenue growth in the western region was partially offset by declines in water management services for the energy market as a result of the decline in oil and natural gas prices.\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $5.3 million, or 49.8%, to $5.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $10.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015.

The decline in revenues for Heavy Civil is due to the continuing strategic shift towards more selective opportunities including negotiated and alternative delivery contracts and less emphasis on traditional fixed-price contracts. These negotiated and alternative delivery contracts are typically lower risk and are contributing to improved margins. Furthermore, certain large projects closed or are nearing completion and have reduced revenues recognized during the current period.\nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes improved $16.9 million, or 78.5%, to $4.6 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $21.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The decrease in loss from continuing operations before income taxes is due to less cost degradation on fixed-price troubled contracts, and improving performance on alternative delivery projects. Further contributing to the reduction in loss from continuing operations before income taxes, were lower selling, general and administrative expenses as Heavy Civil focuses on effectively managing its cost structure, and reduced depreciation expense as the segment continues to reduce capital expenditures, and dispose of underutilized assets.\nMineral Services\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 120,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28,043\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,909\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations before\nincome taxes as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -32.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -12.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,317\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,187\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring costs, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,759\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,403\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity in losses of affiliates, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (612\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,002\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues for Mineral Services decreased $34.3 million, or 28.5%, to $85.9 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $120.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015.\nRevenues declined primarily as a result of the continuation of declining global commodity prices and significant reductions in mining activities around the world. Revenues outside the United States declined more dramatically as our foreign locations were more severely impacted by the drop in commodity prices due to the higher costs of production. Activity in the United States has benefited from the growth of mine water management services.\nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes deteriorated $13.1 million to $28.0 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $14.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. During FY2016, in response to continuing decline in the global minerals market, we implemented a plan to exit our minerals services operations in Africa and Australia. The costs incurred related to the restructuring activities were approximately $16.8 million, which consisted of a $7.9 million write-down of inventory, a $3.9 million write-down of fixed assets, and $5.0 million of severance and other costs. As of January 31, 2016, operations have wound down in Africa and Australia. The primary activity remaining in these locations relate to complying with statutory audit and regulatory requirements.\nEquity in losses of affiliates slightly improved by $1.4 million to $0.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $2.0 million for the year ended January 31, 2015.\nOther\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (132\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (55\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther revenues and loss from continuing operations before income taxes are primarily from purchasing operations. The majority of the revenues are eliminated between segments. The decrease in revenues of $1.5 million to $17.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, from $19.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, is due to segments within Layne taking advantage of the purchasing expertise within this operation.\nUnallocated Corporate Expenses\nCorporate expenses not allocated to individual divisions, primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $37.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $49.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The $12.1 million decrease in corporate expenses was primarily due to decrease in compensation expenses from a workforce reduction as part of the FY2015 Restructuring Plan, as well as decreases in consulting fees, legal and professional fees, and relocation expenses.\nComparison of Fiscal Year 2015 (FY 2015) to Fiscal Year 2014 (FY 2014)\nRevenues decreased $51.5 million, or 6.7%, to $720.6 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $772.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower revenues at Mineral Services and Heavy Civil, partially offset by increases in revenues at Water Resources and Inliner.\nCost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and impairment charges) decreased $34.2 million, to $610.8 million (84.8% of revenues) for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $645.1 million (83.5% of revenues) for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 increased from the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the costs to complete some fixed-price projects in Heavy Civil.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $9.2 million, or 7.3%, to $117.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $126.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily related to decreases in relocation expenses and FCPA investigation related expenses. The decrease in relocation expenses from FY2014 was the result of costs incurred in FY2014 for Layne's move from Mission, Kansas to The Woodlands, Texas. The net decrease in FCPA investigation related expenses is a result of the investigation having been mostly completed as of the end of FY2014 and the reversal of a prior accrual as a result of the DOJ declining to take any action against Layne as discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These decreases were offset by increases in legal and professional fees, incentive compensation and consulting expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $6.8 million, or 14.0%, to $42.0 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $48.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to the reductions in capital expenditures as Layne continued to restrict its capital spending.\nRestructuring costs of $2.7 million were recorded for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, in connection with the FY 2015 Restructuring Plan. These primarily consisted of severance and other related costs associated with workforce reductions and costs to move and consolidate equipment and inventories.\nEquity in losses of affiliates decreased $1.0 million, or 32.7%, to $2.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $3.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Layne's international affiliates recorded losses of $2.0 million due primarily to severance costs as the operations were downsized in response to market conditions.\nInterest expense increased $6.6 million, or 92.2%, to $13.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $7.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Included in interest expense for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2015 and 2014 is the amortization of debt issuance costs of $1.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and the amortization of the discount related to the 4.25% Convertible Notes of $3.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively. The remaining increase in interest expense was primarily due to the 4.25% Convertible Notes being outstanding for the full period in FY2015.\nAn income tax benefit of $3.9 million was recorded on continuing operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to income tax expense on continuing operations of $56.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. The FY2015 tax benefit was primarily due to the carryback of prior year tax losses upon which no tax benefit had previously been recorded. Tax expense recorded during FY2014 resulted primarily from a $54.4 million tax charge due to a valuation allowance provided on deferred tax assets established in a prior year and a tax benefit of $7.1 million recorded on continuing operations offsetting an equal amount of tax expense recorded to equity, in connection with the issuance of the 4.25% Convertible Notes.\nA net loss from discontinued operations of $46.9 million was recorded for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, primarily related to operating losses of the Geoconstruction business segment and the loss on the sale of Costa Fortuna and Tecniwell businesses, both included in the Geoconstruction business segment. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014, a net loss from discontinued operations of $19.7 million was recorded, primarily related to operating losses of the Geoconstruction business segment, including Costa Fortuna and Tecniwell, partially offset by the gain on the sale of SolmeteX business.\nOperating Segment Review of Operations\nWater Resources\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 216,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 182,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,196\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from continuing operations before\nincome taxes as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,530\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,186\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring costs, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (524\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues for Water Resources increased $34.2 million, or 18.8%, to $216.5 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $182.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Water Resources experienced growth primarily as a result of projects in the western portion of the U.S. Inadequate water infrastructure in those regions, combined with lingering drought conditions have resulted in additional opportunities to provide water management services, particularly in the agribusiness market.\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes improved to $10.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $2.2 million loss for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014.

Continued leverage of fixed costs plus slight margin improvements has resulted in improved earnings over last fiscal year.\nHeavy Civil\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 207,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 267,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21,502\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,781\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations before\nincome taxes as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -10.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,060\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,491\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring costs, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (54\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues for Heavy Civil decreased $60.2 million, or 22.5%, to $207.0 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $267.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Revenues for Heavy Civil declined due to its strategic decision to reduce its volume of fixed bid type contracts and to concentrate on increasing its opportunities for more negotiated or alternative delivery contracts, which are typically lower risk.\nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes increased $13.7 million, or 176.3%, to $21.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $7.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Low gross profit margins have resulted in operating results not sufficient to offset overhead costs. Projects which were already experiencing cost overruns were delayed even further than anticipated and several jobs in the northeastern portion of the U.S. experienced adverse weather conditions in the first quarter of FY2015 and during January 2015. Adverse weather conditions cause an increase in expenses on projects due to crew and equipment standby costs, and, once the weather subsides, work may have to be restarted out of sequence in order to meet time constraints implicit within the contracts of certain projects, thereby further reducing profitability.\nThe delays in completing projects have led to additional costs. The estimated costs to complete these projects have been updated to reflect the best information available to us at this time and all estimated future losses have been recorded. It remains possible that, as we reach completion for these projects, we could encounter unforeseen conditions or events which would cause us to revise our estimates and could result in further losses. During FY2015 estimated losses recorded on our larger revenue contracts were approximately $13.5 million. In FY2014 estimated losses of approximately $9.3 million were recorded on our larger revenue contracts.\nMineral Services\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 120,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 172,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,909\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,534\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations before\nincome taxes as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -12.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -5.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,187\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23,321\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring costs, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,403\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses of affiliates, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,002\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,974\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues for Mineral Services decreased $52.7 million, or 30.5%, to $120.2 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $173.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Revenues continued to be impacted by a significant slowdown in global mining exploration activity.\nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes deteriorated $5.4 million to $14.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $9.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014.\nIncluded in the loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 is a decrease to the accrual related to the FCPA investigation of $5.2 million as a result of the DOJ's decision to close its investigation without bringing any charges against Layne, as compared to an increase in the accrual of $6.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014.\nEquity in losses from the affiliates in South America also continued to be impacted by market conditions during FY 2015. Equity in losses of affiliates decreased by $1.0 million to ($2.0) million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 from ($3.0) million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Reductions in the workforce that occurred in FY2014 and again to a lesser degree in FY 2015 in response to the depressed mineral drilling services market resulted in slightly better results during FY2015.\nOther\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (55\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther revenues and (loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes are primarily from purchasing operation. The majority of the revenues are eliminated between segments. The decrease in revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 is due to segments within Layne taking advantage of the purchasing expertise within this operation.\nUnallocated Corporate Expenses\nCorporate expenses not allocated to individual divisions, primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $49.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 compared to $42.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. The $7.1 million increase in corporate expenses was primarily due to increases in legal and professional fees of $5.2 million, $3.4 million in consulting expenses, $0.7 million in restructuring expenses and $1.9 million in rent expense, partially offset by reductions of $2.0 million in relocation expense and $1.1 million in temporary services expenses and $1.5 million in compensation expense.\nInflation\nManagement does not believe the operations for the periods discussed have been significantly adversely affected by inflation or changing prices from its suppliers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have improved our liquidity during the past twelve months. Our primary sources of liquidity have historically been cash from operations, supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities, issuances of Convertible Notes, and sale of assets.\nOur financial performance has been affected by a variety of the risks inherent to the industries and geographies we serve. Among them is the cyclical nature of minerals mining which can be affected significantly and quickly by factors beyond our control. The global slowdown in minerals drilling services continued during FY2016. Factors such as mining company exploration budgets, commodity prices, changes in taxation policy, increasing labor costs and global credit markets have affected the financial performance of Mineral Services. Management expects this trend to continue during FY2017.\nIn response to these conditions, we have undertaken several actions detailed below in an effort to improve our liquidity and financial position.\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> On March 2, 2015, we completed our 8.0% Convertible Notes offering, which improved liquidity by approximately $40.8 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> On August 17, 2015, we closed on the sale of our Geoconstruction business, which provided proceeds of approximately $42.3 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> During the second half of FY2016, we implemented a plan to exit our operations in Africa and Australia. This restructuring is expected to reduce compensation expenses and other operating expenses within these regions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement has also taken several steps to improve and preserve our liquidity position. These steps include managing capital expenditures, reviewing our working capital practices and focusing on reducing overall costs.\nAs of January 31, 2016, our total liquidity was $131.7 million, consisting of Excess Availability under our asset-based facility and total cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2016, were $65.6 million, compared to $21.7 million as of January 31, 2015. Cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries as of January 31, 2016 were $10.8 million, compared to $11.9 million as of January 31, 2015. Of the amounts held by foreign subsidiaries at January 31, 2016, $0.2 million could be subject to repatriation restrictions if the amounts were needed for domestic operations. It is our intention to permanently reinvest funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. Restrictions on the transfer of foreign cash and cash equivalents have not significantly impacted our overall liquidity.\nAs of January 31, 2016, our working capital was $131.3 million compared to $104.8 million as of January 31, 2015. Our working capital increased during fiscal year 2016 primarily due to improved cash flows from operations, and cash generated from the issuance of our 8.0% Convertible Notes, as well as proceeds from the sale of our Geoconstruction business, resulting in the increase in cash and cash equivalents from $21.7 million as of January 31, 2015 to $65.6 million as of January 31, 2016.\nCash Flows\nCash used in operating activities was ($0.3) million, ($23.1) million and ($1.1) million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in cash outflow was primarily due to improved operating results, as well as reduction in customer receivables, inventories, accounts payable and accrued expenses, as a result of efforts to improve our working capital practices.\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities was $22.4 million, ($3.6) million and ($15.0) million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 primarily relates to proceeds from the sale of our Geoconstruction business segment, partially offset by capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2015 and 2014 consisted primarily of capital expenditures partially offset by the sales of assets. We are selectively investing capital expenditures in growth businesses, while continuing to dispose of underutilized assets.\nCash flows provided by financing activities were $21.9 million, $14.9 million, and $25.1 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 primarily relates to proceeds from the issuance of 8.0% Convertible Notes, partially offset by net payments on our asset-based credit facility. Cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 primarily relates to net borrowings on our asset-based credit facility. Cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014 primarily relates to proceeds from the sale and issuance of our 4.25% Convertible Notes, which were used to pay down balances outstanding under the previous credit agreement.\nFinancing Agreements\nBelow is a summary of certain provisions of our credit facility and debt instruments. For more information about our indebtedness, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018. We have outstanding $69.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% Convertible Notes as of January 31, 2016. The 4.25% Convertible Notes bear interest payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The 4.25% Convertible Notes will mature on November 15, 2018, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The 4.25% Convertible Notes are convertible, at the option of the holders, into consideration consisting of, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 15, 2018.\nOn and after November 15, 2016, and prior to the maturity date, we may redeem all, but not less than all, of the 4.25% Convertible Notes for cash if the sale price of our common stock equals or exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price for a specified time period ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date we deliver notice of the redemption. The redemption price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the 4.25% Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the 4.25% Convertible Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase their 4.25% Convertible Notes in cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 4.25% Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\n8.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Convertible Notes. We have outstanding $99.9 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8.0% Convertible Notes as of January 31, 2016. The 8.0% Convertible Notes, issued pursuant to the 8.0% Convertible Notes Indenture, bear interest at a rate of 8.0% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The 8.0% Convertible Notes will mature on May 1, 2019; provided, however, that, unless all of the 4.25% Convertible Notes (or any permitted refinancing indebtedness in respect thereof) have been redeemed, repurchased , otherwise retired, discharged in accordance with their terms or converted into our common stock, or have been effectively discharged, in each case on or prior to August 15, 2018 or the scheduled maturity date of the 4.25% Convertible Notes (or any permitted refinancing indebtedness incurred in respect thereof) is extended to a date that is after October 15, 2019, the 8.0% Convertible Notes will mature on August 15, 2018.\nAt any time prior to the maturity date, we may redeem for cash all, but not less than all, of the 8.0% Convertible Notes; provided, however, that we may not redeem the 8.0% Convertible Notes on a redemption date that is outside an Open Redemption Period (as defined in the 8.0% Convertible Notes Indenture) unless the last reported sale price of our common stock equals or exceeds 140% of the conversion price of the 8.0% Convertible Notes in effect on each of at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we deliver the redemption notice.\nIn addition, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change\u201d (as defined in the 8.0% Convertible Notes Indenture), holders of the 8.0% Convertible Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase their 8.0% Convertible Notes in cash at a\nprice equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 8.0% Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nAsset-based revolving credit facility. As of January 31, 2016, availability under our asset-based facility was approximately $100.0 million, with outstanding letters of credit amounting to $33.9 million, leaving Excess Availability of $66.1 million.\nThe asset-based facility is guaranteed by our direct and indirectly wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions described in the asset-based facility. The obligations under the asset-based facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and the assets of the guarantor subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions described in the asset-based facility, including a pledge of up to 65.0% of the equity interest of our first tier foreign subsidiaries.\nWe must maintain a cumulative minimum cash flow as defined in the agreement of not less than negative $45.0 million and during any twelve consecutive month period, a minimum cash flow of not less than negative $25.0 million, until:\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> for a period of 30 consecutive days, Excess Availability is greater than the greater of 17.5% of the Total Availability or $17.5 million, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> for two consecutive fiscal quarters after the closing date, the fixed charge coverage ratio (tested on a trailing four fiscal quarter basis) has been in excess of 1.0 to 1.0.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMinimum cash flow is defined as consolidated EBITDA minus the sum of:\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> capital expenditures,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> cash interest expense,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> any regularly scheduled amortized principal payments on indebtedness, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> cash taxes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA comparison of the required covenants under the asset-based facility to the current compliance is as follows:\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Trailing twelve month period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cumulative from May 1, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Minimum Cash Flow cannot be less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (45.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Actual as of January 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf Excess Availability is less than the greater of 17.5% of Total Availability or $17.5 million for more than one business day, then a Covenant Compliance Period\u201d (as defined in the asset-based facility agreement) will exist until Excess Availability has been equal to or greater than the greater of 17.5% of the Total Availability or $17.5 million for a period of 30 consecutive days. We must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 and a maximum first lien leverage ratio of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 for the four fiscal quarters ended immediately preceding any Covenant Compliance Period and for any four fiscal quarter period ending during a Covenant Compliance Period. We would not have been in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio had we been in a Covenant Compliance Period during any fiscal quarter ending from July 31, 2014 through April 30, 2015, and for the fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2016.\nThe asset-based facility also contains a subjective acceleration clause that can be triggered if the lenders determine that we have experienced a material adverse change. If triggered by the lenders, this clause would create an Event of Default Period (as defined in the asset-based facility agreement) which in turn would permit the lenders to accelerate repayment of outstanding obligations.\nIn general, during a Covenant Compliance or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all of our funds received on a daily basis will be applied to reduce amounts owing under the asset-based facility. Based on current projections, we do not anticipate being in a Covenant Compliance Period during the next twelve months.\nManagement believes that it has the ability to implement and execute measures so that we will continue to have sufficient and adequate funds to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for the next twelve months. Further, we are in compliance with our covenants related to all of our outstanding indebtedness as of January 31, 2016, and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants during the next twelve months.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nContractual obligations and commercial commitments as of January 31, 2016, are summarized as follows:\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments/Expiration by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual obligations and other commercial commitments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 4.25% Convertible Notes (including interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 8.0% Convertible Notes (including interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 127,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized leases (including interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Supplemental retirement benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax uncertainties, current\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 238,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 203,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations and commercial\ncommitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 272,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 203,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect to meet our cash contractual obligations in the ordinary course of operations, and that the standby letters of credit will be renewed in connection with its annual insurance renewal process.\nThe 4.25% Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.25% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The 4.25% Convertible Notes will mature on November 15, 2018 unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted (under the terms of the 4.25% Convertible Notes Indenture).\nThe 8.0% Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 8.0% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The 8.0% Convertible Notes will mature on May 1, 2019, subject to certain provisions in the 8.0% Convertible Notes Indenture.\nCapitalized leases are obligations for certain vehicles and equipment. The interest rates on these obligations are fixed, but range from 3.6% to 6.2% annually, depending on the lease.\nWe have income tax uncertainties in the amount of $10.4 million at January 31, 2016, that are classified as non-current on the balance sheet as resolution of these matters is expected to take more than a year. The ultimate timing of resolution of these items is uncertain, and accordingly the amounts have not been included in the table above.\nWe have surety bonds to secure performance of our projects, amounting to $259.7 million as of January 31, 2016. The amount is not included in the table above as information on the timing of the resolution of the amounts is not available.\nAdditional obligations in the ordinary course of operations are also incurred. These obligations, including but not limited to income tax payments, are expected to be met in the normal course of operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discuss the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nOur accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, located in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We believe that the following accounting policies represent management's more critical policies. Critical accounting policies, practices and estimates are a subset of significant accounting policies that are considered most important to the description of our financial condition and results, and that require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nRevenue Recognition - The significant estimates with regard to these consolidated financial statements relate to the estimation of total forecasted construction contract revenues, costs and profits in accordance with the criteria established in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 605-35 Construction-type and Production-type Contracts\u201d.\nBased on experience and our current processes we produce materially reliable estimates of total contract revenue and cost during any accounting period. However, many factors can and do change during a contract performance period which can result in a change to contract profitability from one financial reporting period to another. Some of the factors that can change the estimate of total contract revenue and cost include differing site conditions (to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable), the availability of skilled contract labor, the performance of major material suppliers, the performance of major subcontractors, unusual weather conditions and unexpected changes in material costs. These factors may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions to costs and revenues become known. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted construction contracts are made in the period in which they become known. Large changes in cost estimates on larger, more complex construction projects can have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and are reflected in the results of operations when they become known; smaller contracts or smaller changes in estimates usually do not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nThe nature of accounting for contracts is such that refinements of the estimating process for changing conditions and new developments are continuous and characteristic of the process. Prior to the execution of a contract, any related costs are expensed during the period incurred. Generally during the early stages of a contract, cost estimates relating to purchases of materials and subcontractors can be subject to revisions. As a contract moves into the most productive phase of execution, change orders, project cost estimate revisions and claims are frequently the sources for changes in estimates. During the contract's final phase, remaining estimated costs to complete or provisions for claims will be closed out and adjusted based on actual costs incurred. The impact on operating margin in a reporting period and future periods from a change in estimate will depend on the stage of contract completion. Generally, if the contract is at an early stage of completion, the current period impact is smaller than if the same change in estimate is made to the contract at a later stage of completion.\nThere were no material change orders during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. There were no material contract penalties, claims, settlements or changes in contract estimates during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. No amounts were netted in revenue during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nWe have provided for all estimated costs to complete on all of the ongoing contracts. However, it is possible that current estimates could change due to unforeseen events, which could result in adjustments to overall contract costs. Variances from estimated contract performance could result in material adjustments to operating results for any fiscal quarter or year. For all contracts, if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss, the projected loss is recognized in full when such losses become known. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately $22.2 million, $25.2 million and $17.5 million in losses on open contracts were recorded, respectively. The current provision for loss contracts is $1.5 million and $3.3 million as of January 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of January 31, 2016, we have two material contracts in a loss position located in the Southeast region. The contracts are expected to be completed in FY2017. We have provided for all expected costs to complete as of January 31, 2016. Further, as of January 31, 2016, there were no contracts, individually, that could be reasonably estimated to be in a material loss position in the future.\nManagement focuses on evaluating the performance of contracts individually. In the ordinary course of business, and at a minimum on a quarterly basis, based on changes in facts, such as an approved scope change or a change in estimate, projected total contract revenue, cost and profit or loss for each of our contracts is updated. Normal recurring changes in estimates include, but are not limited to:\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> changes in estimated scope as a result of unapproved or unpriced customer change orders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> changes in estimated productivity assumptions based on experience to date;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> changes in estimated materials costs based on experience to date;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> changes in estimated subcontractor costs based on subcontractor experience; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> changes in the timing of scheduled work that may impact future costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen determining the likelihood of recovering unapproved change orders and claims, we consider the history and experience of similar projects and apply judgment to estimate the amount of eventual recovery. Settlement of events such as these can take several years depending on how easily the claim is able to be resolved with the customer or whether arbitration or litigation is necessary to reach settlement. As new facts become known, an adjustment to the estimated recovery is made and reflected in the period in which it becomes known.\nThe cumulative effect of revisions in estimates of the total revenues and costs, including unapproved change orders and claims, during the course of the work is reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that caused the revisions become known. The financial impact of these revisions to any one contract is a function of both the amount of the revision and the percentage of completion of the contract.\nRevenues are recognized on large, long-term construction contracts meeting the criteria of ASC Topic 605-35 using the percentage-of-completion method based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion. Most of our contracts which utilize the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition have terms of six months to four years. Contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage-of-completion are reflected in contract revenues in the reporting period when such estimate revisions become known. When the estimate on a contract indicates a loss, the entire loss is recorded during the accounting period in which it becomes known. In the ordinary course of business, management prepares updated estimates of the total forecasted revenue, cost and profit or loss for each contract. The cumulative effects of these updated estimates are reflected in the period in which they become known. The financial impact of any revisions to an individual contract is a function of the amount of the revision and the percentage of completion of the contract itself. An amount up to the costs that have been incurred involving unapproved change orders and claims is included in the total estimated revenue when the realization is probable. The amount of unapproved change orders and claim revenues is included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as part of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings. Any profit as a result of change orders or claims is recorded in the period in which the change order or claim is resolved.\nCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents the excess of contract costs and contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method over contract billings to date. Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings occur when:\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> costs related to unapproved change orders or claims are incurred, or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> a portion of the revenue recorded cannot be billed currently due to the billing terms in the contract.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs allowed by ASC Topic 605-35, revenue is recognized on smaller, short-term construction contracts using the completed contract method. Our contracts which utilize the completed contract method of revenue recognition have contract terms of twelve months or less. We consider contracts such as these completed upon acceptance by the customer.\nContracts for mineral drilling services within Mineral Services are billable based on the quantity of drilling performed. Revenues are recognized in terms of the value of total work performed to date on the basis of actual footage or meterage drilled.\nThe percentage of our revenues recognized by percentage of completion, mineral drilling services and completed contract to total revenues for each of the fiscal years as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations are:\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Approximate Percentage of Total Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of Completion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mineral Drilling Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Completed Contract\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpairment of Goodwill, Other Long-lived Assets and Equity Method Investments - We review the carrying value of goodwill, other long-lived assets and equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill.\nThe evaluation for goodwill impairment is conducted at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments. We have the option of performing a qualitative or quantitative assessment to determine if impairment has occurred. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we would be required to perform a quantitative impairment test for goodwill. As of December 31, 2015, our annual impairment date, we performed a qualitative assessment for our annual goodwill impairment test of our Inliner segment which is the only reporting unit that has a remaining goodwill balance of $8.9 million. This assessment indicated we had not experienced triggering events or other indicators which would require further analysis.\nA quantitative assessment for the determination of impairment was made at December 31, 2013, by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit with its fair value. The evaluation is performed by using a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded. In the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets) in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. Inliner is the only reporting unit with remaining goodwill and as of January 31, 2014, the fair value of this reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value of $8.9 million.\nWe consider both a market approach and an income approach in estimating the fair value of each reporting unit in our analysis. The market approach may include use of the guideline transaction method, the guideline company method, or both. Layne considers the guideline company method by using market multiples of publically traded companies with operating characteristics similar to the respective reporting unit. The income approach uses projections of each reporting unit's estimated cash flows discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions. Management also compares the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization plus a control premium.\nManagement uses judgment to determine the more significant assumptions used in the income approach, which are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. These assumptions include:\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Anticipated future cash flows and long-term growth rates for each reporting unit. The income approach to determining fair value relies on the timing and estimates of future cash flows, including an estimate of long-term growth rates. The projections use management's estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales and estimates of expected changes in operating margins. Our projections of future expected cash flows are subject to change as actual results are achieved that differ from those anticipated. Actual results could vary significantly from estimates. To develop cash flows from future operating margins and new contract awards, we track prospective work for each of our reporting units on a contract by contract basis as well as estimating time of when the work would be bid, awarded, started and completed.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Selection of an appropriate discount rate. The income approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which is based on a weighted-average cost of capital analysis. The discount rate is subject to changes in short-term interest rates and long-term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants in our industry. The discount rate is determined based on assumptions that would be used by marketplace participants, and for that reason, the capital structure of selected marketplace participants was used in the weighted-average cost of capital analysis. Given the current volatile economic conditions, it is possible that the discount rate could change.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn a quarterly basis we consider whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets, including goodwill, might be impaired. In conjunction with this analysis, we evaluate whether the current market capitalization is less than equity and specifically consider (1) changes in macroeconomic conditions, (2) changes in general economic conditions in the industry including any declines in market-dependent multiples, (3) cost factors such as increases in materials, labor, or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows analyses, and (4) the impact of current market conditions on our forecast of future cash flows including consideration of specific projects in backlog, pending awards, or large prospect opportunities. We also evaluate the most recent assessment of the fair value for each of the reporting units, considering whether the current forecast of future cash flows is in line with those used in the annual impairment assessment and whether there are any significant changes in trends or any other material assumptions used. As a result of this process, we determined the carrying value of Geoconstruction's goodwill exceeded its fair value and recorded an impairment charge of $14.6 million during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of impairment charge recorded as part of loss on discontinued operations.\nLong-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Factors management considers important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following:\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> significant underperformance of our assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> significant changes in the use of the assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> significant negative industry or economic trends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAn impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. An impairment loss shall be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, which is generally calculated using a combination of market, comparable transaction, third party quoted prices or asset appraisals, and discounted cash flow approaches.\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, as a result of our decision to exit our operations in Africa and Australia, we performed an assessment of property and equipment located in these locations. Based on our assessment, property and equipment in Africa and Australia with carrying value of $10.4 million was adjusted to reflect its estimated fair value of $6.5 million, resulting in a charge of approximately $3.9 million recorded as part of restructuring costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016. The fair value of the assets was determined based on available third-party quoted prices and appraisals of assets.\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, due to continued and prolonged depression of commodity prices, decreased activity levels and consecutive quarterly operating losses, we reviewed the recoverability of the asset values of our long-lived assets in the Heavy Civil and Mineral Services segments. Based on our analysis, the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the assets at the end of their useful life exceeded the carrying value of the assets in the respective segments, and no indication of impairment existed.\nPrior to the segment realignment in the third quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, we reviewed the recoverability of the asset values of our long-lived assets in the Energy Services segment as of July 31, 2015. Using the undiscounted cash flow model, we concluded that the carrying value of the assets in the Energy Services was not fully recoverable as of July 31, 2015. We performed an assessment of the fair value of the assets of Energy Services based on orderly liquidation value of the property and equipment. This assessment resulted in the recording of an impairment charge of approximately $4.6 million, which is shown as impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016. During the fiscal years ending January 31, 2015 and 2014, no impairments were indicated by this analysis.\nA loss in value of an equity method investment is recognized when the decline is deemed to be other than temporary. Unforeseen events and changes in market conditions could have a material effect on the value of equity method investments due to changes in estimated sales growth rates and estimates of expected changes in operating margins, and could result in an impairment charge. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, due to the extended downturn in the minerals market, and its negative impact on the operating results of our affiliates, we reviewed our equity method investments for impairment. Based on weighted approach of the discounted cash flow method and market approach, we concluded that the fair value exceeds the carrying amount of our equity investments. Accordingly, no impairment charge was recorded during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016. Additionally, we considered the sensitivity of our fair value estimates to changes in certain valuation assumptions. Key assumptions used in our valuation include the discount rate and revenue growth rate, including the estimated timing of the minerals market recovery. Based on the following independent sensitivity analyses: an increase in the assumed discount rate by 300 basis points, a decrease in the revenue growth rate by over 500 basis points (independent of the timing of the minerals market recovery), or a delay of approximately seven years in the timing of the minerals market recovery would result in an impairment charge. A change in any one of the assumptions listed above could change the valuation of the investments between $2.4 million to $3.4 million which could result in an impairment of the investments. The effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of our equity investments is calculated without changing any other assumption; in reality, changes in one factor may be associated with changes in another, which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities. The investment in affiliates balance as of January 31, 2016 was $57.4 million.\nIncome Taxes - Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method, in which deferred taxes are recognized on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. Critical estimates and assumptions related to deferred taxes include items such as uncertainty of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, the high number of tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the related complexities and uncertain outcome of audits and reviews by foreign tax officials. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. Accounting guidance states that a cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome in determining that a valuation allowance is not needed against deferred tax assets. As such, it is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses.\nFor the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 and 2015, we had a cumulative three year loss in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, and therefore gave little consideration to forecasted book income in future years as a source of positive evidence. We considered the periods in which future reversals of existing taxable and deductible temporary differences are likely to occur, taxable income available in prior carryback years, and the availability of tax-planning strategies when determining realization of recorded deferred tax assets. No tax benefit was recorded on U. S. tax losses and certain foreign tax losses generated during the year because valuation allowances were provided on current year losses.\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am unable to identify the specific cells in the table you would like to copy.\n- Would you be able to clarify which cells you would like to copy?

Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under Item 8.\nCautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, statements of plans and objectives, statements of future economic performance and statements of assumptions underlying such statements, and statements of management's intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future. Forward-looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as should,\u201d intended,\u201d continue,\u201d believe,\u201d may,\u201d hope,\u201d anticipate,\u201d goal,\u201d forecast,\u201d plan,\u201d estimate\u201d and similar words or phrases. Such statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including but not limited to: prevailing prices for various commodities (including gold, copper, crude oil and natural gas), the duration of the current slowdown in the mineral drilling services market, unanticipated slowdowns in Layne's major markets, the availability of credit, the risks and uncertainties normally incident to the construction industry, the timing for the completion of the existing unprofitable contracts in Heavy Civil, the impact of competition, the effectiveness of operational changes expected to increase efficiency and productivity and reduce costs, worldwide economic and political conditions and foreign currency fluctuations that may affect worldwide results of operations. Many of the factors that will determine these items are beyond Layne's ability to control or predict.

These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this filing, and Layne assumes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand Layne, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report. MD&A includes the following sections:\n \u00b7 Business-a general description of our business and key fiscal year 2016 events. \n \u00b7 Consolidated Review of Operations-an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in the consolidated financial statements. \n \u00b7 Operating Segment Review of Operations-an analysis of our results of operations for the three years presented in the consolidated financial statements for our reporting segments: Water Resources, Inliner, Heavy Civil and Mineral Services. \n \u00b7 Liquidity and Capital Resources-an analysis of cash flows, aggregate financial commitments and certain financial condition ratios. \n \u00b7 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates that involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity. \nBusiness\nLayne is a global water management, construction and drilling company. We provide responsible solutions for water, mineral and energy challenges. We manage and report our operations through four segments: Water Resources, Inliner, Heavy Civil and Mineral Services.\nKey Fiscal Year 2016 Events\nOn March 2, 2015, we completed the offering of approximately $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.0% Convertible Notes. The 8.0% Convertible Notes were offered at par to certain investors that held approximately $55.5 million of our 4.25% Convertible Notes pursuant to terms in which the investors agreed to (i) exchange the 4.25% Convertible Notes owned by them for approximately $49.9 million of the 8.0% Convertible Notes and (ii) purchase approximately $49.9 million aggregate principal amount of 8.0% Convertible Notes at a cash price equal to the principal amount thereof. We received net cash proceeds from the issuance of 8.0% Convertible Notes, net of expenses related to the offering of approximately $45.0 million. We used a portion of the net cash proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our asset-based credit facility, with the remainder of the net cash proceeds held for general working capital purposes. See Part II, Item 7 - Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information.\nMineral Services continues to be impacted by the global slowdown in spending for mineral drilling services, both in the markets served by our wholly-owned operations and our Latin American affiliates. Global spending for minerals drilling services has decreased significantly over the past three years in every geographic region. This has reduced the revenues generated by Mineral Services and has adversely affected our results of operations and cash flows. During FY2016, in response to continuing decline in the global minerals market, we implemented a plan to exit our operations in Africa and Australia. The restructuring, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of FY2017, was designed to optimize our cost structure, and involved a reduction in workforce and the disposition of assets.\nOn May 20, 2015, we signed a definitive agreement to sell our Geoconstruction business. The transaction closed on August 17, 2015 for total consideration of $42.3 million, including the preliminary estimate of the business segment's working capital which was subject to a post-closing reconciliation. After post-closing adjustments, the total purchase price increased to $47.7 million, to adjust for our estimated share in the profits of one of the contracts being assumed by the buyer and final working capital adjustments. We expect to use the net proceeds from the sale for general corporate purposes and growth opportunities in our core businesses. The disposition is discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConcurrent with the closing of the sale of the Geoconstruction business segment on August 17, 2015, our existing asset-based facility was amended to, among other things: (1) reduce the maximum amount that may be borrowed under the asset-based facility from $120.0 million to $100.0 million; (2) eliminate the $15.0 million Availability Block (as defined in the asset-based facility agreement); (3) reduce Minimum Excess Availability from $25.0 million to $17.5 million; (4) revise the borrowing base calculation; and (5) increase the annual commitment fee on unused commitments from 0.50% to 0.75%.\nDuring the third quarter of FY2016, we realigned our operating structure by combining the Energy Services segment with the Water Resources segment. This segment realignment is expected to increase efficiencies both in terms of asset management and operations.\nWe appointed J. Michael Anderson as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective July 20, 2015. Mr. Anderson brings more than 25 years of experience in senior management roles at publicly-traded companies in the water and energy industries, and in commercial and investment banking.\nEffective November 9, 2015, we appointed Jami M. Phillips as the principal accounting officer. Ms. Phillips has worked for us in various finance positions since 2013, and has served as our Controller since October 9, 2014. Prior to working for us, Ms. Phillips worked for CBIZ, Inc., a financial services company from 2010 to 2013.\nConsolidated Review of Operations\nThe following table, which is derived from our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, presents, for the periods indicated, the percentage relationship which certain items reflected in our results of operations bear to revenues and the percentage increase or decrease in the dollar amount of such items period-to-period.\n\n * not meaningful \nRevenues, equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates and income (loss) before income taxes pertaining to our operating segments are presented below. Unallocated corporate expenses primarily consist of general and administrative functions performed on a company-wide basis and benefiting all operating segments. These costs include accounting, financial reporting, internal audit, treasury, legal, tax compliance, information technology, executive management and Board of Directors.\n\nComparison of Fiscal Year 2016 (FY 2016) to Fiscal Year 2015 (FY 2015)\nRevenues decreased $37.6 million, or 5.2%, to $683.0 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $720.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower revenues at Mineral Services and Heavy Civil, partially offset by increases in revenues at Water Resources and Inliner.\nCost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and impairment charges) decreased $40.8 million, to $570.1 million (83.5% of revenues) for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $610.8 million (84.8% of revenues) for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. Cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 included a $7.9 million (1.2% of revenues) write-down of inventory as part of our restructuring activities in Africa and Australia. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 decreased from the prior year, primarily due to improved margins in Heavy Civil and Water Resources.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $8.9 million, or 7.6%, to $108.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $117.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The decreases were primarily due to overall effort to reduce overhead costs, including reductions in consulting expenses, compensation expenses due to the FY2015 Restructuring Plan, relocation costs, and office rent.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $9.3 million, or 22.1%, to $32.7 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $42.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to reductions in capital expenditures over the past several years, disposal of underutilized assets, and impairment of certain fixed assets during the current fiscal year.\nAn asset impairment charge of $4.6 million was recorded during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 for the Energy Services segment, which was previously reported as a separate segment prior to being combined with Water Resources segment beginning in the third quarter of FY2016. The impairment charge was recorded to reflect reductions in the estimated fair value of certain long-lived assets.\nRestructuring costs of $10.0 million were recorded for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $2.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, restructuring costs related to a $3.9 million asset write-down, combined with $6.1 million of severance and other costs, as part of the restructuring activities in Africa and Australia.\nRestructuring costs for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 primarily consisted of severance and other related costs associated with the FY2015 Restructuring Plan.\nEquity in losses of affiliates decreased $1.4 million, or 69.4%, to $0.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $2.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015.\nA gain on extinguishment of debt of $4.2 million was recognized during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 in connection with the partial redemption of the 4.25% Convertible Notes in exchange for 8.0% Convertible Notes, as discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest expense increased $4.3 million, or 31.4%, to $18.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $13.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The increase in interest expense was mainly due to a higher debt balance and higher average interest rate with the issuance of the 8.0% Convertible Notes during the first quarter of FY2016.\nIncome tax benefit from continuing operations of $1.6 million was recorded for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $3.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The FY2016 tax benefit included $3.6 million of benefit recorded as an offset to an equal amount of tax expense in discontinued operations less $2.0 million of tax expense relating to other items in continuing operations. The FY2015 tax benefit was primarily due to the carryback of prior year tax losses upon which no tax benefit had previously been recorded. A cash refund of $3.9 million was received in early FY2016.\nThe result of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 included net income from discontinued operations of $8.1 million, primarily related to the gain on the sale of our Geoconstruction business. A net loss from discontinued operations of $46.9 million was recorded for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, primarily related to operating losses of the Geoconstruction business segment and the loss on the sale of Costa Fortuna and Tecniwell businesses, both included in the Geoconstruction business segment.\nOperating Segment Review of Operations\nWater Resources\n\nRevenues for Water Resources increased $11.1 million, or 5.1%, to $227.5 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $216.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The revenue growth in Water Resources was driven mainly by drilling projects in the western portion of the U.S. related to lingering drought conditions. The revenue growth in the western region was partially offset by declines in water management services for the energy market as a result of the decline in oil and natural gas prices.\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $5.3 million, or 49.8%, to $5.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $10.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. An asset impairment charge of $4.6 million was recorded during the second quarter of FY2016 to reflect reductions in the estimated fair value of the long-lived assets serving the energy industry.\nInliner\n\nRevenues for Inliner increased $18.7 million, or 10.7%, to $193.7 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $175.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. Revenues increased primarily due to the growth in the number of crews and associated equipment, which increased from 34 in the prior year to 38 at the end of the current fiscal year.\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes increased $1.6 million, or 7.0%, to $24.5 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $22.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes was attributed to the growth in revenues.\nHeavy Civil\n\nRevenues for Heavy Civil decreased $31.3 million, or 15.1%, to $175.8 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $207.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The decline in revenues for Heavy Civil is due to the continuing strategic shift towards more selective opportunities including negotiated and alternative delivery contracts and less emphasis on traditional fixed-price contracts. These negotiated and alternative delivery contracts are typically lower risk and are contributing to improved margins. Furthermore, certain large projects closed or are nearing completion and have reduced revenues recognized during the current period.\nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes improved $16.9 million, or 78.5%, to $4.6 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $21.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The decrease in loss from continuing operations before income taxes is due to less cost degradation on fixed-price troubled contracts, and improving performance on alternative delivery projects. Further contributing to the reduction in loss from continuing operations before income taxes, were lower selling, general and administrative expenses as Heavy Civil focuses on effectively managing its cost structure, and reduced depreciation expense as the segment continues to reduce capital expenditures, and dispose of underutilized assets.\nMineral Services\n\nRevenues for Mineral Services decreased $34.3 million, or 28.5%, to $85.9 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $120.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015.\nRevenues declined primarily as a result of the continuation of declining global commodity prices and significant reductions in mining activities around the world. Revenues outside the United States declined more dramatically as our foreign locations were more severely impacted by the drop in commodity prices due to the higher costs of production. Activity in the United States has benefited from the growth of mine water management services.\nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes deteriorated $13.1 million to $28.0 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $14.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. During FY2016, in response to continuing decline in the global minerals market, we implemented a plan to exit our minerals services operations in Africa and Australia. The costs incurred related to the restructuring activities were approximately $16.8 million, which consisted of a $7.9 million write-down of inventory, a $3.9 million write-down of fixed assets, and $5.0 million of severance and other costs. As of January 31, 2016, operations have wound down in Africa and Australia. The primary activity remaining in these locations relate to complying with statutory audit and regulatory requirements.\nEquity in losses of affiliates slightly improved by $1.4 million to $0.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $2.0 million for the year ended January 31, 2015.\nOther\n\nOther revenues and loss from continuing operations before income taxes are primarily from purchasing operations. The majority of the revenues are eliminated between segments. The decrease in revenues of $1.5 million to $17.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, from $19.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, is due to segments within Layne taking advantage of the purchasing expertise within this operation.\nUnallocated Corporate Expenses\nCorporate expenses not allocated to individual divisions, primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $37.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $49.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The $12.1 million decrease in corporate expenses was primarily due to decrease in compensation expenses from a workforce reduction as part of the FY2015 Restructuring Plan, as well as decreases in consulting fees, legal and professional fees, and relocation expenses.\nComparison of Fiscal Year 2015 (FY 2015) to Fiscal Year 2014 (FY 2014)\nRevenues decreased $51.5 million, or 6.7%, to $720.6 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $772.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower revenues at Mineral Services and Heavy Civil, partially offset by increases in revenues at Water Resources and Inliner.\nCost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and impairment charges) decreased $34.2 million, to $610.8 million (84.8% of revenues) for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $645.1 million (83.5% of revenues) for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 increased from the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the costs to complete some fixed-price projects in Heavy Civil.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $9.2 million, or 7.3%, to $117.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $126.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily related to decreases in relocation expenses and FCPA investigation related expenses. The decrease in relocation expenses from FY2014 was the result of costs incurred in FY2014 for Layne's move from Mission, Kansas to The Woodlands, Texas. The net decrease in FCPA investigation related expenses is a result of the investigation having been mostly completed as of the end of FY2014 and the reversal of a prior accrual as a result of the DOJ declining to take any action against Layne as discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These decreases were offset by increases in legal and professional fees, incentive compensation and consulting expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $6.8 million, or 14.0%, to $42.0 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $48.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to the reductions in capital expenditures as Layne continued to restrict its capital spending.\nRestructuring costs of $2.7 million were recorded for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, in connection with the FY 2015 Restructuring Plan. These primarily consisted of severance and other related costs associated with workforce reductions and costs to move and consolidate equipment and inventories.\nEquity in losses of affiliates decreased $1.0 million, or 32.7%, to $2.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $3.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Layne's international affiliates recorded losses of $2.0 million due primarily to severance costs as the operations were downsized in response to market conditions.\nInterest expense increased $6.6 million, or 92.2%, to $13.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $7.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Included in interest expense for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2015 and 2014 is the amortization of debt issuance costs of $1.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and the amortization of the discount related to the 4.25% Convertible Notes of $3.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively. The remaining increase in interest expense was primarily due to the 4.25% Convertible Notes being outstanding for the full period in FY2015.\nAn income tax benefit of $3.9 million was recorded on continuing operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to income tax expense on continuing operations of $56.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. The FY2015 tax benefit was primarily due to the carryback of prior year tax losses upon which no tax benefit had previously been recorded. Tax expense recorded during FY2014 resulted primarily from a $54.4 million tax charge due to a valuation allowance provided on deferred tax assets established in a prior year and a tax benefit of $7.1 million recorded on continuing operations offsetting an equal amount of tax expense recorded to equity, in connection with the issuance of the 4.25% Convertible Notes.\nA net loss from discontinued operations of $46.9 million was recorded for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, primarily related to operating losses of the Geoconstruction business segment and the loss on the sale of Costa Fortuna and Tecniwell businesses, both included in the Geoconstruction business segment. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014, a net loss from discontinued operations of $19.7 million was recorded, primarily related to operating losses of the Geoconstruction business segment, including Costa Fortuna and Tecniwell, partially offset by the gain on the sale of SolmeteX business.\nOperating Segment Review of Operations\nWater Resources\n\nRevenues for Water Resources increased $34.2 million, or 18.8%, to $216.5 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $182.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Water Resources experienced growth primarily as a result of projects in the western portion of the U.S. Inadequate water infrastructure in those regions, combined with lingering drought conditions have resulted in additional opportunities to provide water management services, particularly in the agribusiness market.\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes improved to $10.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $2.2 million loss for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Water Resources has been carefully analyzing its locations and overhead expenses to increase efficiencies and lower costs, but still provide locations to best service the areas where projects are located. Direct costs as a percentage of revenue decreased from 77.1% for the year ended January 31, 2014 to 74.2% for the year ended January 31, 2015. The growth in revenues, combined with slight margin improvements across most of its operations, and better leverage of our fixed costs have resulted in improved earnings.\nInliner\n\nRevenues for Inliner increased $26.6 million, or 17.9%, to $175.0 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $148.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Revenues continued to grow across all of its markets, and also benefited from the introductions of its fiberglass-based lining products, which accounted for approximately $6.1 million in revenue for the year ended January 31, 2015.\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes increased $5.2 million, or 29.6%, to $22.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $17.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Overall direct costs improved as a percentage of revenues from 79.9% for the year ended January 31, 2014 to 78.5% for the year ended January 31, 2015. Continued leverage of fixed costs plus slight margin improvements has resulted in improved earnings over last fiscal year.\nHeavy Civil\n\nRevenues for Heavy Civil decreased $60.2 million, or 22.5%, to $207.0 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $267.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Revenues for Heavy Civil declined due to its strategic decision to reduce its volume of fixed bid type contracts and to concentrate on increasing its opportunities for more negotiated or alternative delivery contracts, which are typically lower risk.\nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes increased $13.7 million, or 176.3%, to $21.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $7.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Low gross profit margins have resulted in operating results not sufficient to offset overhead costs. Projects which were already experiencing cost overruns were delayed even further than anticipated and several jobs in the northeastern portion of the U.S. experienced adverse weather conditions in the first quarter of FY2015 and during January 2015. Adverse weather conditions cause an increase in expenses on projects due to crew and equipment standby costs, and, once the weather subsides, work may have to be restarted out of sequence in order to meet time constraints implicit within the contracts of certain projects, thereby further reducing profitability.\nThe delays in completing projects have led to additional costs. The estimated costs to complete these projects have been updated to reflect the best information available to us at this time and all estimated future losses have been recorded. It remains possible that, as we reach completion for these projects, we could encounter unforeseen conditions or events which would cause us to revise our estimates and could result in further losses. During FY2015 estimated losses recorded on our larger revenue contracts were approximately $13.5 million. In FY2014 estimated losses of approximately $9.3 million were recorded on our larger revenue contracts.\nMineral Services\n\nRevenues for Mineral Services decreased $52.7 million, or 30.5%, to $120.2 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $173.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Revenues continued to be impacted by a significant slowdown in global mining exploration activity.\nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes deteriorated $5.4 million to $14.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $9.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014.\nIncluded in the loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 is a decrease to the accrual related to the FCPA investigation of $5.2 million as a result of the DOJ's decision to close its investigation without bringing any charges against Layne, as compared to an increase in the accrual of $6.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014.\nEquity in losses from the affiliates in South America also continued to be impacted by market conditions during FY 2015. Equity in losses of affiliates decreased by $1.0 million to ($2.0) million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 from ($3.0) million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Reductions in the workforce that occurred in FY2014 and again to a lesser degree in FY 2015 in response to the depressed mineral drilling services market resulted in slightly better results during FY2015.\nOther\n\nOther revenues and (loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes are primarily from purchasing operation. The majority of the revenues are eliminated between segments. The decrease in revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 is due to segments within Layne taking advantage of the purchasing expertise within this operation.\nUnallocated Corporate Expenses\nCorporate expenses not allocated to individual divisions, primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $49.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 compared to $42.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. The $7.1 million increase in corporate expenses was primarily due to increases in legal and professional fees of $5.2 million, $3.4 million in consulting expenses, $0.7 million in restructuring expenses and $1.9 million in rent expense, partially offset by reductions of $2.0 million in relocation expense and $1.1 million in temporary services expenses and $1.5 million in compensation expense.\nInflation\nManagement does not believe the operations for the periods discussed have been significantly adversely affected by inflation or changing prices from its suppliers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have improved our liquidity during the past twelve months. Our primary sources of liquidity have historically been cash from operations, supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities, issuances of Convertible Notes, and sale of assets.\nOur financial performance has been affected by a variety of the risks inherent to the industries and geographies we serve. Among them is the cyclical nature of minerals mining which can be affected significantly and quickly by factors beyond our control. The global slowdown in minerals drilling services continued during FY2016. Factors such as mining company exploration budgets, commodity prices, changes in taxation policy, increasing labor costs and global credit markets have affected the financial performance of Mineral Services. Management expects this trend to continue during FY2017.\nIn response to these conditions, we have undertaken several actions detailed below in an effort to improve our liquidity and financial position.\n \u00b7 On March 2, 2015, we completed our 8.0% Convertible Notes offering, which improved liquidity by approximately $40.8 million. \n \u00b7 On August 17, 2015, we closed on the sale of our Geoconstruction business, which provided proceeds of approximately $42.3 million. \n \u00b7 During the second half of FY2016, we implemented a plan to exit our operations in Africa and Australia. This restructuring is expected to reduce compensation expenses and other operating expenses within these regions. \nManagement has also taken several steps to improve and preserve our liquidity position. These steps include managing capital expenditures, reviewing our working capital practices and focusing on reducing overall costs.\nAs of January 31, 2016, our total liquidity was $131.7 million, consisting of Excess Availability under our asset-based facility and total cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2016, were $65.6 million, compared to $21.7 million as of January 31, 2015. Cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries as of January 31, 2016 were $10.8 million, compared to $11.9 million as of January 31, 2015. Of the amounts held by foreign subsidiaries at January 31, 2016, $0.2 million could be subject to repatriation restrictions if the amounts were needed for domestic operations. It is our intention to permanently reinvest funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. Restrictions on the transfer of foreign cash and cash equivalents have not significantly impacted our overall liquidity.\nAs of January 31, 2016, our working capital was $131.3 million compared to $104.8 million as of January 31, 2015. Our working capital increased during fiscal year 2016 primarily due to improved cash flows from operations, and cash generated from the issuance of our 8.0% Convertible Notes, as well as proceeds from the sale of our Geoconstruction business, resulting in the increase in cash and cash equivalents from $21.7 million as of January 31, 2015 to $65.6 million as of January 31, 2016.\nCash Flows\nCash used in operating activities was ($0.3) million, ($23.1) million and ($1.1) million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in cash outflow was primarily due to improved operating results, as well as reduction in customer receivables, inventories, accounts payable and accrued expenses, as a result of efforts to improve our working capital practices.\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities was $22.4 million, ($3.6) million and ($15.0) million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 primarily relates to proceeds from the sale of our Geoconstruction business segment, partially offset by capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2015 and 2014 consisted primarily of capital expenditures partially offset by the sales of assets. We are selectively investing capital expenditures in growth businesses, while continuing to dispose of underutilized assets.\nCash flows provided by financing activities were $21.9 million, $14.9 million, and $25.1 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 primarily relates to proceeds from the issuance of 8.0% Convertible Notes, partially offset by net payments on our asset-based credit facility. Cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 primarily relates to net borrowings on our asset-based credit facility. Cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014 primarily relates to proceeds from the sale and issuance of our 4.25% Convertible Notes, which were used to pay down balances outstanding under the previous credit agreement.\nFinancing Agreements\nBelow is a summary of certain provisions of our credit facility and debt instruments. For more information about our indebtedness, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018. We have outstanding $69.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% Convertible Notes as of January 31, 2016. The 4.25% Convertible Notes bear interest payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The 4.25% Convertible Notes will mature on November 15, 2018, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The 4.25% Convertible Notes are convertible, at the option of the holders, into consideration consisting of, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 15, 2018.\nOn and after November 15, 2016, and prior to the maturity date, we may redeem all, but not less than all, of the 4.25% Convertible Notes for cash if the sale price of our common stock equals or exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price for a specified time period ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date we deliver notice of the redemption. The redemption price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the 4.25% Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the 4.25% Convertible Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase their 4.25% Convertible Notes in cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 4.25% Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\n8.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Convertible Notes. We have outstanding $99.9 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8.0% Convertible Notes as of January 31, 2016. The 8.0% Convertible Notes, issued pursuant to the 8.0% Convertible Notes Indenture, bear interest at a rate of 8.0% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The 8.0% Convertible Notes will mature on May 1, 2019; provided, however, that, unless all of the 4.25% Convertible Notes (or any permitted refinancing indebtedness in respect thereof) have been redeemed, repurchased , otherwise retired, discharged in accordance with their terms or converted into our common stock, or have been effectively discharged, in each case on or prior to August 15, 2018 or the scheduled maturity date of the 4.25% Convertible Notes (or any permitted refinancing indebtedness incurred in respect thereof) is extended to a date that is after October 15, 2019, the 8.0% Convertible Notes will mature on August 15, 2018.\nAt any time prior to the maturity date, we may redeem for cash all, but not less than all, of the 8.0% Convertible Notes; provided, however, that we may not redeem the 8.0% Convertible Notes on a redemption date that is outside an Open Redemption Period (as defined in the 8.0% Convertible Notes Indenture) unless the last reported sale price of our common stock equals or exceeds 140% of the conversion price of the 8.0% Convertible Notes in effect on each of at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we deliver the redemption notice.\nIn addition, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change\u201d (as defined in the 8.0% Convertible Notes Indenture), holders of the 8.0% Convertible Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase their 8.0% Convertible Notes in cash at a\nprice equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 8.0% Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nAsset-based revolving credit facility. As of January 31, 2016, availability under our asset-based facility was approximately $100.0 million, with outstanding letters of credit amounting to $33.9 million, leaving Excess Availability of $66.1 million.\nThe asset-based facility is guaranteed by our direct and indirectly wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions described in the asset-based facility. The obligations under the asset-based facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and the assets of the guarantor subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions described in the asset-based facility, including a pledge of up to 65.0% of the equity interest of our first tier foreign subsidiaries.\nWe must maintain a cumulative minimum cash flow as defined in the agreement of not less than negative $45.0 million and during any twelve consecutive month period, a minimum cash flow of not less than negative $25.0 million, until:\n \u25cf for a period of 30 consecutive days, Excess Availability is greater than the greater of 17.5% of the Total Availability or $17.5 million, and \n \u25cf for two consecutive fiscal quarters after the closing date, the fixed charge coverage ratio (tested on a trailing four fiscal quarter basis) has been in excess of 1.0 to 1.0. \nMinimum cash flow is defined as consolidated EBITDA minus the sum of:\n \u25cf capital expenditures, \n \u25cf cash interest expense, \n \u25cf any regularly scheduled amortized principal payments on indebtedness, and \n \u25cf cash taxes. \nA comparison of the required covenants under the asset-based facility to the current compliance is as follows:\n\nIf Excess Availability is less than the greater of 17.5% of Total Availability or $17.5 million for more than one business day, then a Covenant Compliance Period\u201d (as defined in the asset-based facility agreement) will exist until Excess Availability has been equal to or greater than the greater of 17.5% of the Total Availability or $17.5 million for a period of 30 consecutive days. We must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 and a maximum first lien leverage ratio of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 for the four fiscal quarters ended immediately preceding any Covenant Compliance Period and for any four fiscal quarter period ending during a Covenant Compliance Period. We would not have been in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio had we been in a Covenant Compliance Period during any fiscal quarter ending from July 31, 2014 through April 30, 2015, and for the fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2016.\nThe asset-based facility also contains a subjective acceleration clause that can be triggered if the lenders determine that we have experienced a material adverse change. If triggered by the lenders, this clause would create an Event of Default Period (as defined in the asset-based facility agreement) which in turn would permit the lenders to accelerate repayment of outstanding obligations.\nIn general, during a Covenant Compliance or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all of our funds received on a daily basis will be applied to reduce amounts owing under the asset-based facility. Based on current projections, we do not anticipate being in a Covenant Compliance Period during the next twelve months.\nManagement believes that it has the ability to implement and execute measures so that we will continue to have sufficient and adequate funds to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for the next twelve months. Further, we are in compliance with our covenants related to all of our outstanding indebtedness as of January 31, 2016, and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants during the next twelve months.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nContractual obligations and commercial commitments as of January 31, 2016, are summarized as follows:\n\nWe expect to meet our cash contractual obligations in the ordinary course of operations, and that the standby letters of credit will be renewed in connection with its annual insurance renewal process.\nThe 4.25% Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.25% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The 4.25% Convertible Notes will mature on November 15, 2018 unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted (under the terms of the 4.25% Convertible Notes Indenture).\nThe 8.0% Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 8.0% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The 8.0% Convertible Notes will mature on May 1, 2019, subject to certain provisions in the 8.0% Convertible Notes Indenture.\nCapitalized leases are", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under Item 8.\nCautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, statements of plans and objectives, statements of future economic performance and statements of assumptions underlying such statements, and statements of management's intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future. Forward-looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as should,\u201d intended,\u201d continue,\u201d believe,\u201d may,\u201d hope,\u201d anticipate,\u201d goal,\u201d forecast,\u201d plan,\u201d estimate\u201d and similar words or phrases. Such statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including but not limited to: prevailing prices for various commodities (including gold, copper, crude oil and natural gas), the duration of the current slowdown in the mineral drilling services market, unanticipated slowdowns in Layne's major markets, the availability of credit, the risks and uncertainties normally incident to the construction industry, the timing for the completion of the existing unprofitable contracts in Heavy Civil, the impact of competition, the effectiveness of operational changes expected to increase efficiency and productivity and reduce costs, worldwide economic and political conditions and foreign currency fluctuations that may affect worldwide results of operations. Many of the factors that will determine these items are beyond Layne's ability to control or predict. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially and adversely from those anticipated, estimated or projected. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this filing, and Layne assumes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand Layne, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report. MD&A includes the following sections:\n \u00b7 Business-a general description of our business and key fiscal year 2016 events. \n \u00b7 Consolidated Review of Operations-an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in the consolidated financial statements. \n \u00b7 Operating Segment Review of Operations-an analysis of our results of operations for the three years presented in the consolidated financial statements for our reporting segments: Water Resources, Inliner, Heavy Civil and Mineral Services. \n \u00b7 Liquidity and Capital Resources-an analysis of cash flows, aggregate financial commitments and certain financial condition ratios. \n \u00b7 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates that involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity. \nBusiness\nLayne is a global water management, construction and drilling company. We provide responsible solutions for water, mineral and energy challenges. We manage and report our operations through four segments: Water Resources, Inliner, Heavy Civil and Mineral Services.\nKey Fiscal Year 2016 Events\nOn March 2, 2015, we completed the offering of approximately $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.0% Convertible Notes. The 8.0% Convertible Notes were offered at par to certain investors that held approximately $55.5 million of our 4.25% Convertible Notes pursuant to terms in which the investors agreed to (i) exchange the 4.25% Convertible Notes owned by them for approximately $49.9 million of the 8.0% Convertible Notes and (ii) purchase approximately $49.9 million aggregate principal amount of 8.0% Convertible Notes at a cash price equal to the principal amount thereof. We received net cash proceeds from the issuance of 8.0% Convertible Notes, net of expenses related to the offering of approximately $45.0 million. We used a portion of the net cash proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our asset-based credit facility, with the remainder of the net cash proceeds held for general working capital purposes. See Part II, Item 7 - Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information.\nMineral Services continues to be impacted by the global slowdown in spending for mineral drilling services, both in the markets served by our wholly-owned operations and our Latin American affiliates. Global spending for minerals drilling services has decreased significantly over the past three years in every geographic region. This has reduced the revenues generated by Mineral Services and has adversely affected our results of operations and cash flows. During FY2016, in response to continuing decline in the global minerals market, we implemented a plan to exit our operations in Africa and Australia. The restructuring, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of FY2017, was designed to optimize our cost structure, and involved a reduction in workforce and the disposition of assets.\nOn May 20, 2015, we signed a definitive agreement to sell our Geoconstruction business. The transaction closed on August 17, 2015 for total consideration of $42.3 million, including the preliminary estimate of the business segment's working capital which was subject to a post-closing reconciliation. After post-closing adjustments, the total purchase price increased to $47.7 million, to adjust for our estimated share in the profits of one of the contracts being assumed by the buyer and final working capital adjustments. We expect to use the net proceeds from the sale for general corporate purposes and growth opportunities in our core businesses. The disposition is discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConcurrent with the closing of the sale of the Geoconstruction business segment on August 17, 2015, our existing asset-based facility was amended to, among other things: (1) reduce the maximum amount that may be borrowed under the asset-based facility from $120.0 million to $100.0 million; (2) eliminate the $15.0 million Availability Block (as defined in the asset-based facility agreement); (3) reduce Minimum Excess Availability from $25.0 million to $17.5 million; (4) revise the borrowing base calculation; and (5) increase the annual commitment fee on unused commitments from 0.50% to 0.75%.\nDuring the third quarter of FY2016, we realigned our operating structure by combining the Energy Services segment with the Water Resources segment. This segment realignment is expected to increase efficiencies both in terms of asset management and operations.\nWe appointed J. Michael Anderson as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective July 20, 2015. Mr. Anderson brings more than 25 years of experience in senior management roles at publicly-traded companies in the water and energy industries, and in commercial and investment banking.\nEffective November 9, 2015, we appointed Jami M. Phillips as the principal accounting officer. Ms. Phillips has worked for us in various finance positions since 2013, and has served as our Controller since October 9, 2014. Prior to working for us, Ms. Phillips worked for CBIZ, Inc., a financial services company from 2010 to 2013.\nConsolidated Review of Operations\nThe following table, which is derived from our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, presents, for the periods indicated, the percentage relationship which certain items reflected in our results of operations bear to revenues and

$683.0 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $720.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower revenues at Mineral Services and Heavy Civil, partially offset by increases in revenues at Water Resources and Inliner.\nCost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and impairment charges) decreased $40.8 million, to $570.1 million (83.5% of revenues) for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $610.8 million (84.8% of revenues) for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. Cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 included a $7.9 million (1.2% of revenues) write-down of inventory as part of our restructuring activities in Africa and Australia. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 decreased from the prior year, primarily due to improved margins in Heavy Civil and Water Resources.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $8.9 million, or 7.6%, to $108.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $117.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The decreases were primarily due to overall effort to reduce overhead costs, including reductions in consulting expenses, compensation expenses due to the FY2015 Restructuring Plan, relocation costs, and office rent.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $9.3 million, or 22.1%, to $32.7 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $42.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to reductions in capital expenditures over the past several years, disposal of underutilized assets, and impairment of certain fixed assets during the current fiscal year.\nAn asset impairment charge of $4.6 million was recorded during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 for the Energy Services segment, which was previously reported as a separate segment prior to being combined with Water Resources segment beginning in the third quarter of FY2016. The impairment charge was recorded to reflect reductions in the estimated fair value of certain long-lived assets.\nRestructuring costs of $10.0 million were recorded for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $2.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, restructuring costs related to a $3.9 million asset write-down, combined with $6.1 million of severance and other costs, as part of the restructuring activities in Africa and Australia.\nRestructuring costs for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 primarily consisted of severance and other related costs associated with the FY2015 Restructuring Plan.\nEquity in losses of affiliates decreased $1.4 million, or 69.4%, to $0.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $2.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015.\nA gain on extinguishment of debt of $4.2 million was recognized during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 in connection with the partial redemption of the 4.25% Convertible Notes in exchange for 8.0% Convertible Notes, as discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest expense increased $4.3 million, or 31.4%, to $18.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $13.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The increase in interest expense was mainly due to a higher debt balance and higher average interest rate with the issuance of the 8.0% Convertible Notes during the first quarter of FY2016.\nIncome tax benefit from continuing operations of $1.6 million was recorded for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $3.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The FY2016 tax benefit included $3.6 million of benefit recorded as an offset to an equal amount of tax expense in discontinued operations less $2.0 million of tax expense relating to other items in continuing operations. The FY2015 tax benefit was primarily due to the carryback of prior year tax losses upon which no tax benefit had previously been recorded. A cash refund of $3.9 million was received in early FY2016.\nThe result of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 included net income from discontinued operations of $8.1 million, primarily related to the gain on the sale of our Geoconstruction business. A net loss from discontinued operations of $46.9 million was recorded for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, primarily related to operating losses of the Geoconstruction business segment and the loss on the sale of Costa Fortuna and Tecniwell businesses, both included in the Geoconstruction business segment.\nOperating Segment Review of Operations\nWater Resources\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 227,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 216,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from continuing operations before\nincome taxes as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,471\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,530\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment charges, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,598\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring costs, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (524\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues for Water Resources increased $11.1 million, or 5.1%, to $227.5 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $216.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The revenue growth in Water Resources was driven mainly by drilling projects in the western portion of the U.S. related to lingering drought conditions. The revenue growth in the western region was partially offset by declines in water management services for the energy market as a result of the decline in oil and natural gas prices.\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $5.3 million, or 49.8%, to $5.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $10.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015.

The decline in revenues for Heavy Civil is due to the continuing strategic shift towards more selective opportunities including negotiated and alternative delivery contracts and less emphasis on traditional fixed-price contracts. These negotiated and alternative delivery contracts are typically lower risk and are contributing to improved margins. Furthermore, certain large projects closed or are nearing completion and have reduced revenues recognized during the current period.\nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes improved $16.9 million, or 78.5%, to $4.6 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $21.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The decrease in loss from continuing operations before income taxes is due to less cost degradation on fixed-price troubled contracts, and improving performance on alternative delivery projects. Further contributing to the reduction in loss from continuing operations before income taxes, were lower selling, general and administrative expenses as Heavy Civil focuses on effectively managing its cost structure, and reduced depreciation expense as the segment continues to reduce capital expenditures, and dispose of underutilized assets.\nMineral Services\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 120,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28,043\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,909\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations before\nincome taxes as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -32.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -12.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,317\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,187\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring costs, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,759\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,403\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity in losses of affiliates, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (612\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,002\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues for Mineral Services decreased $34.3 million, or 28.5%, to $85.9 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $120.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015.\nRevenues declined primarily as a result of the continuation of declining global commodity prices and significant reductions in mining activities around the world. Revenues outside the United States declined more dramatically as our foreign locations were more severely impacted by the drop in commodity prices due to the higher costs of production. Activity in the United States has benefited from the growth of mine water management services.\nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes deteriorated $13.1 million to $28.0 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $14.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. During FY2016, in response to continuing decline in the global minerals market, we implemented a plan to exit our minerals services operations in Africa and Australia. The costs incurred related to the restructuring activities were approximately $16.8 million, which consisted of a $7.9 million write-down of inventory, a $3.9 million write-down of fixed assets, and $5.0 million of severance and other costs. As of January 31, 2016, operations have wound down in Africa and Australia. The primary activity remaining in these locations relate to complying with statutory audit and regulatory requirements.\nEquity in losses of affiliates slightly improved by $1.4 million to $0.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $2.0 million for the year ended January 31, 2015.\nOther\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (132\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (55\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther revenues and loss from continuing operations before income taxes are primarily from purchasing operations. The majority of the revenues are eliminated between segments. The decrease in revenues of $1.5 million to $17.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, from $19.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, is due to segments within Layne taking advantage of the purchasing expertise within this operation.\nUnallocated Corporate Expenses\nCorporate expenses not allocated to individual divisions, primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $37.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $49.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The $12.1 million decrease in corporate expenses was primarily due to decrease in compensation expenses from a workforce reduction as part of the FY2015 Restructuring Plan, as well as decreases in consulting fees, legal and professional fees, and relocation expenses.\nComparison of Fiscal Year 2015 (FY 2015) to Fiscal Year 2014 (FY 2014)\nRevenues decreased $51.5 million, or 6.7%, to $720.6 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $772.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower revenues at Mineral Services and Heavy Civil, partially offset by increases in revenues at Water Resources and Inliner.\nCost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and impairment charges) decreased $34.2 million, to $610.8 million (84.8% of revenues) for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $645.1 million (83.5% of revenues) for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 increased from the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the costs to complete some fixed-price projects in Heavy Civil.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $9.2 million, or 7.3%, to $117.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $126.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily related to decreases in relocation expenses and FCPA investigation related expenses. The decrease in relocation expenses from FY2014 was the result of costs incurred in FY2014 for Layne's move from Mission, Kansas to The Woodlands, Texas. The net decrease in FCPA investigation related expenses is a result of the investigation having been mostly completed as of the end of FY2014 and the reversal of a prior accrual as a result of the DOJ declining to take any action against Layne as discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These decreases were offset by increases in legal and professional fees, incentive compensation and consulting expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $6.8 million, or 14.0%, to $42.0 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $48.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to the reductions in capital expenditures as Layne continued to restrict its capital spending.\nRestructuring costs of $2.7 million were recorded for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, in connection with the FY 2015 Restructuring Plan. These primarily consisted of severance and other related costs associated with workforce reductions and costs to move and consolidate equipment and inventories.\nEquity in losses of affiliates decreased $1.0 million, or 32.7%, to $2.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $3.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Layne's international affiliates recorded losses of $2.0 million due primarily to severance costs as the operations were downsized in response to market conditions.\nInterest expense increased $6.6 million, or 92.2%, to $13.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $7.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Included in interest expense for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2015 and 2014 is the amortization of debt issuance costs of $1.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and the amortization of the discount related to the 4.25% Convertible Notes of $3.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively. The remaining increase in interest expense was primarily due to the 4.25% Convertible Notes being outstanding for the full period in FY2015.\nAn income tax benefit of $3.9 million was recorded on continuing operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to income tax expense on continuing operations of $56.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. The FY2015 tax benefit was primarily due to the carryback of prior year tax losses upon which no tax benefit had previously been recorded. Tax expense recorded during FY2014 resulted primarily from a $54.4 million tax charge due to a valuation allowance provided on deferred tax assets established in a prior year and a tax benefit of $7.1 million recorded on continuing operations offsetting an equal amount of tax expense recorded to equity, in connection with the issuance of the 4.25% Convertible Notes.\nA net loss from discontinued operations of $46.9 million was recorded for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, primarily related to operating losses of the Geoconstruction business segment and the loss on the sale of Costa Fortuna and Tecniwell businesses, both included in the Geoconstruction business segment. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014, a net loss from discontinued operations of $19.7 million was recorded, primarily related to operating losses of the Geoconstruction business segment, including Costa Fortuna and Tecniwell, partially offset by the gain on the sale of SolmeteX business.\nOperating Segment Review of Operations\nWater Resources\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 216,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 182,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,196\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from continuing operations before\nincome taxes as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,530\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,186\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring costs, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (524\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues for Water Resources increased $34.2 million, or 18.8%, to $216.5 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $182.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Water Resources experienced growth primarily as a result of projects in the western portion of the U.S. Inadequate water infrastructure in those regions, combined with lingering drought conditions have resulted in additional opportunities to provide water management services, particularly in the agribusiness market.\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes improved to $10.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $2.2 million loss for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Water Resources has been carefully analyzing its locations and overhead expenses to increase efficiencies and lower costs, but still provide locations to best service the areas where projects are located. Direct costs as a percentage of revenue decreased from 77.1% for the year ended January 31, 2014 to 74.2% for the year ended January 31, 2015. The growth in revenues, combined with slight margin improvements across most of its operations, and better leverage of our fixed costs have resulted in improved earnings.\nInliner\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 175,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 148,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from continuing operations before\nincome taxes as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,767\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,805\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues for Inliner increased $26.6 million, or 17.9%, to $175.0 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $148.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014.

Revenues for Heavy Civil declined due to its strategic decision to reduce its volume of fixed bid type contracts and to concentrate on increasing its opportunities for more negotiated or alternative delivery contracts, which are typically lower risk.\nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes increased $13.7 million, or 176.3%, to $21.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $7.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Low gross profit margins have resulted in operating results not sufficient to offset overhead costs. Projects which were already experiencing cost overruns were delayed even further than anticipated and several jobs in the northeastern portion of the U.S. experienced adverse weather conditions in the first quarter of FY2015 and during January 2015. Adverse weather conditions cause an increase in expenses on projects due to crew and equipment standby costs, and, once the weather subsides, work may have to be restarted out of sequence in order to meet time constraints implicit within the contracts of certain projects, thereby further reducing profitability.\nThe delays in completing projects have led to additional costs. The estimated costs to complete these projects have been updated to reflect the best information available to us at this time and all estimated future losses have been recorded. It remains possible that, as we reach completion for these projects, we could encounter unforeseen conditions or events which would cause us to revise our estimates and could result in further losses. During FY2015 estimated losses recorded on our larger revenue contracts were approximately $13.5 million. In FY2014 estimated losses of approximately $9.3 million were recorded on our larger revenue contracts.\nMineral Services\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 120,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 172,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,909\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,534\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations before\nincome taxes as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -12.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -5.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,187\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23,321\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring costs, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,403\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses of affiliates, included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,002\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,974\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues for Mineral Services decreased $52.7 million, or 30.5%, to $120.2 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $173.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014.

The majority of the revenues are eliminated between segments. The decrease in revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 is due to segments within Layne taking advantage of the purchasing expertise within this operation.\nUnallocated Corporate Expenses\nCorporate expenses not allocated to individual divisions, primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $49.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 compared to $42.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. The $7.1 million increase in corporate expenses was primarily due to increases in legal and professional fees of $5.2 million, $3.4 million in consulting expenses, $0.7 million in restructuring expenses and $1.9 million in rent expense, partially offset by reductions of $2.0 million in relocation expense and $1.1 million in temporary services expenses and $1.5 million in compensation expense.\nInflation\nManagement does not believe the operations for the periods discussed have been significantly adversely affected by inflation or changing prices from its suppliers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have improved our liquidity during the past twelve months. Our primary sources of liquidity have historically been cash from operations, supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities, issuances of Convertible Notes, and sale of assets.\nOur financial performance has been affected by a variety of the risks inherent to the industries and geographies we serve. Among them is the cyclical nature of minerals mining which can be affected significantly and quickly by factors beyond our control. The global slowdown in minerals drilling services continued during FY2016. Factors such as mining company exploration budgets, commodity prices, changes in taxation policy, increasing labor costs and global credit markets have affected the financial performance of Mineral Services. Management expects this trend to continue during FY2017.\nIn response to these conditions, we have undertaken several actions detailed below in an effort to improve our liquidity and financial position.\n \u00b7 On March 2, 2015, we completed our 8.0% Convertible Notes offering, which improved liquidity by approximately $40.8 million. \n \u00b7 On August 17, 2015, we closed on the sale of our Geoconstruction business, which provided proceeds of approximately $42.3 million. \n \u00b7 During the second half of FY2016, we implemented a plan to exit our operations in Africa and Australia. This restructuring is expected to reduce compensation expenses and other operating expenses within these regions. \nManagement has also taken several steps to improve and preserve our liquidity position. These steps include managing capital expenditures, reviewing our working capital practices and focusing on reducing overall costs.\nAs of January 31, 2016, our total liquidity was $131.7 million, consisting of Excess Availability under our asset-based facility and total cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2016, were $65.6 million, compared to $21.7 million as of January 31, 2015. Cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries as of January 31, 2016 were $10.8 million, compared to $11.9 million as of January 31, 2015. Of the amounts held by foreign subsidiaries at January 31, 2016, $0.2 million could be subject to repatriation restrictions if the amounts were needed for domestic operations. It is our intention to permanently reinvest funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. Restrictions on the transfer of foreign cash and cash equivalents have not significantly impacted our overall liquidity.\nAs of January 31, 2016, our working capital was $131.3 million compared to $104.8 million as of January 31, 2015. Our working capital increased during fiscal year 2016 primarily due to improved cash flows from operations, and cash generated from the issuance of our 8.0% Convertible Notes, as well as proceeds from the sale of our Geoconstruction business, resulting in the increase in cash and cash equivalents from $21.7 million as of January 31, 2015 to $65.6 million as of January 31, 2016.\nCash Flows\nCash used in operating activities was ($0.3) million, ($23.1) million and ($1.1) million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in cash outflow was primarily due to improved operating results, as well as reduction in customer receivables, inventories, accounts payable and accrued expenses, as a result of efforts to improve our working capital practices.\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities was $22.4 million, ($3.6) million and ($15.0) million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 primarily relates to proceeds from the sale of our Geoconstruction business segment, partially offset by capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2015 and 2014 consisted primarily of capital expenditures partially offset by the sales of assets. We are selectively investing capital expenditures in growth businesses, while continuing to dispose of underutilized assets.\nCash flows provided by financing activities were $21.9 million, $14.9 million, and $25.1 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 primarily relates to proceeds from the issuance of 8.0% Convertible Notes, partially offset by net payments on our asset-based credit facility. Cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 primarily relates to net borrowings on our asset-based credit facility. Cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014 primarily relates to proceeds from the sale and issuance of our 4.25% Convertible Notes, which were used to pay down balances outstanding under the previous credit agreement.\nFinancing Agreements\nBelow is a summary of certain provisions of our credit facility and debt instruments. For more information about our indebtedness, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018. We have outstanding $69.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% Convertible Notes as of January 31, 2016. The 4.25% Convertible Notes bear interest payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The 4.25% Convertible Notes will mature on November 15, 2018, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The 4.25% Convertible Notes are convertible, at the option of the holders, into consideration consisting of, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 15, 2018.\nOn and after November 15, 2016, and prior to the maturity date, we may redeem all, but not less than all, of the 4.25% Convertible Notes for cash if the sale price of our common stock equals or exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price for a specified time period ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date we deliver notice of the redemption. The redemption price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the 4.25% Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the 4.25% Convertible Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase their 4.25% Convertible Notes in cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 4.25% Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\n8.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Convertible Notes. We have outstanding $99.9 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8.0% Convertible Notes as of January 31, 2016. The 8.0% Convertible Notes, issued pursuant to the 8.0% Convertible Notes Indenture, bear interest at a rate of 8.0% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The 8.0% Convertible Notes will mature on May 1, 2019; provided, however, that, unless all of the 4.25% Convertible Notes (or any permitted refinancing indebtedness in respect thereof) have been redeemed, repurchased , otherwise retired, discharged in accordance with their terms or converted into our common stock, or have been effectively discharged, in each case on or prior to August 15, 2018 or the scheduled maturity date of the 4.25% Convertible Notes (or any permitted refinancing indebtedness incurred in respect thereof) is extended to a date that is after October 15, 2019, the 8.0% Convertible Notes will mature on August 15, 2018.\nAt any time prior to the maturity date, we may redeem for cash all, but not less than all, of the 8.0% Convertible Notes; provided, however, that we may not redeem the 8.0% Convertible Notes on a redemption date that is outside an Open Redemption Period (as defined in the 8.0% Convertible Notes Indenture) unless the last reported sale price of our common stock equals or exceeds 140% of the conversion price of the 8.0% Convertible Notes in effect on each of at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we deliver the redemption notice.\nIn addition, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change\u201d (as defined in the 8.0% Convertible Notes Indenture), holders of the 8.0% Convertible Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase their 8.0% Convertible Notes in cash at a\nprice equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 8.0% Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nAsset-based revolving credit facility. As of January 31, 2016, availability under our asset-based facility was approximately $100.0 million, with outstanding letters of credit amounting to $33.9 million, leaving Excess Availability of $66.1 million.\nThe asset-based facility is guaranteed by our direct and indirectly wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions described in the asset-based facility. The obligations under the asset-based facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and the assets of the guarantor subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions described in the asset-based facility, including a pledge of up to 65.0% of the equity interest of our first tier foreign subsidiaries.\nWe must maintain a cumulative minimum cash flow as defined in the agreement of not less than negative $45.0 million and during any twelve consecutive month period, a minimum cash flow of not less than negative $25.0 million, until:\n \u25cf for a period of 30 consecutive days, Excess Availability is greater than the greater of 17.5% of the Total Availability or $17.5 million, and \n \u25cf for two consecutive fiscal quarters after the closing date, the fixed charge coverage ratio (tested on a trailing four fiscal quarter basis) has been in excess of 1.0 to 1.0. \nMinimum cash flow is defined as consolidated EBITDA minus the sum of:\n \u25cf capital expenditures, \n \u25cf cash interest expense, \n \u25cf any regularly scheduled amortized principal payments on indebtedness, and \n \u25cf cash taxes. \nA comparison of the required covenants under the asset-based facility to the current compliance is as follows:\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Trailing twelve month period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cumulative from May 1, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Minimum Cash Flow cannot be less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (45.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Actual as of January 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf Excess Availability is less than the greater of 17.5% of Total Availability or $17.5 million for more than one business day, then a Covenant Compliance Period\u201d (as defined in the asset-based facility agreement) will exist until Excess Availability has been equal to or greater than the greater of 17.5% of the Total Availability or $17.5 million for a period of 30 consecutive days. We must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 and a maximum first lien leverage ratio of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 for the four fiscal quarters ended immediately preceding any Covenant Compliance Period and for any four fiscal quarter period ending during a Covenant Compliance Period. We would not have been in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio had we been in a Covenant Compliance Period during any fiscal quarter ending from July 31, 2014 through April 30, 2015, and for the fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2016.\nThe asset-based facility also contains a subjective acceleration clause that can be triggered if the lenders determine that we have experienced a material adverse change. If triggered by the lenders, this clause would create an Event of Default Period (as defined in the asset-based facility agreement) which in turn would permit the lenders to accelerate repayment of outstanding obligations.\nIn general, during a Covenant Compliance or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all of our funds received on a daily basis will be applied to reduce amounts owing under the asset-based facility. Based on current projections, we do not anticipate being in a Covenant Compliance Period during the next twelve months.\nManagement believes that it has the ability to implement and execute measures so that we will continue to have sufficient and adequate funds to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for the next twelve months. Further, we are in compliance with our covenants related to all of our outstanding indebtedness as of January 31, 2016, and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants during the next twelve months.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nContractual obligations and commercial commitments as of January 31, 2016, are summarized as follows:\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments/Expiration by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual obligations and other commercial commitments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 4.25% Convertible Notes (including interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 8.0% Convertible Notes (including interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 127,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized leases (including interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Supplemental retirement benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax uncertainties, current\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 238,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 203,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations and commercial\ncommitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 272,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 203,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect to meet our cash contractual obligations in the ordinary course of operations, and that the standby letters of credit will be renewed in connection with its annual insurance renewal process.\nThe 4.25% Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.25% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on May 15 and November 15 of each year.
