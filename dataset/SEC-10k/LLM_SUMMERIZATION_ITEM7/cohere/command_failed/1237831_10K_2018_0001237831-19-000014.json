Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d sections of this Annual Report for a discussion of certain of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements described in the following discussion and analysis. Certain amounts and percentages in this discussion and analysis have been rounded for convenience of presentation.\nOverview\nWe are an engineering-driven company with a history of rapidly developing and commercializing advanced products and procedures to address treatment challenges. With over 190 products on the market, we offer a comprehensive portfolio of innovative and differentiated technologies that treat a variety of musculoskeletal conditions of the spine, extremities and pelvis. Although we manage our business globally within one operating segment, we separate our products into two major categories: Musculoskeletal Solutions and Enabling Technologies.\nMusculoskeletal Solutions\nMusculoskeletal Solutions consist primarily of implantable devices, biologics, accessories, and unique surgical instruments used in an expansive range of spinal, orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures.\nOur broad spectrum of spine products addresses the vast majority of conditions affecting the spine including degenerative conditions, deformity, tumors, and trauma. With more than fifteen years in this competitive market, we provide comprehensive solutions that facilitate both open and minimally invasive surgery ( MIS\u201d) techniques. This includes traditional fusion implants such as pedicle screw and rod systems, plating systems, intervertebral spacers and corpectomy devices. We believe we pioneered innovative expandable solutions for interbody fusion, corpectomy and interspinous fixation that allow intraoperative customization of our devices to the patient's anatomy and save surgical time by eliminating sequential trialing. We have also developed treatment options for motion preservation technologies, such as dynamic stabilization, total disc replacement and interspinous distraction devices; and interventional pain management solutions to treat vertebral compression fractures. Regenerative biologic products such as allografts and synthetic alternatives are adjunctive treatments typically used in combination with stabilizing implant hardware.\nOur orthopedic trauma solutions are designed to treat a wide variety of orthopedic fracture patterns and patient anatomies in the upper and lower extremities as well as the hip. To date, Globus has received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) for numerous orthopedic trauma and extremity products, covering four major segments of the orthopedic trauma market - fracture plates, compression screws, intramedullary nails, and external fixation. We began marketing these products in 2018 and intend to grow our presence in this field. Fracture plating includes proximal humerus, distal radius, proximal tibia, distal fibula, small fragment, mini-fragment and clavicle plates. Intramedullary nailing includes tibial, trochanteric, and femoral nail systems. Regenerative biologic products such as bone void fillers and allograft struts are also used in orthopedic procedures where applicable.\nEnabling Technologies\nEnabling Technologies are advanced computer-assisted intelligent systems designed to enhance a surgeon's capabilities and streamline surgical procedures to be safer, less invasive, more accurate, and more reproducible, to ultimately improve patient care and reduce radiation exposure for all involved.\nOur current enabling technologies are comprised of imaging, navigation and robotic ( INR\u201d) assisted surgery solutions. This includes the ExcelsiusGPS\u00ae platform, a robotic guidance and navigation system that supports minimally invasive and open procedures with screw placement applications. The ExcelsiusGPS\u00ae platform has a modular design that can be used for a variety of screw placement applications, and we expect that it will serve as a foundation for future clinical applications using artificial intelligence and augmented reality.\nGlobus' innovative Enabling Technologies products offer surgeons more information about patient anatomy and surgical options to help them to make well-informed surgical decisions. We believe the advantages of pre-planning implant position and viewing patient anatomy during surgery are self-evident, and also create significant secondary gains such as eliminating radiation exposure altogether.\nWhile we group our products into two categories, they are not limited to a particular technology, platform or surgical approach. Instead, our goal is to offer a comprehensive product suite that can be used to effectively treat patients based on their specific anatomy and condition, and is customized to the surgeon's training and surgical preference.\nTo date, the primary market for our products has been the United States, where we sell our products through a combination of direct sales representatives employed by us and distributor sales representatives employed by our exclusive independent distributors, who distribute our products on our behalf for a commission that is generally based on a percentage of sales. We believe there is significant opportunity to strengthen our position in the U.S. market by increasing the size of our U.S. sales force and we intend to add additional direct and distributor sales representatives in the future.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our international sales accounted for approximately 17% of our total sales. We currently sell our products in 51 countries outside the United States through a combination of direct sales representatives employed by us and exclusive international distributors. We believe there are significant opportunities for us to increase our presence in both existing and new international markets through the continued expansion of our direct and distributor sales forces and the commercialization of additional products.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nWe manage our business globally within one operating segment, which is consistent with how our management reviews our business, makes investment and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance.\nSales\nToday, we sell primarily implants and related disposables, primarily to hospitals, for use by surgeons to treat musculoskeletal disorders. We generally consign our surgical sets, which contain our implants, disposables, surgical instruments and cases to our sales representatives, and the sets are maintained with the sales representatives or at our hospital customers that purchase the implants and related disposables used in the surgeries. We recognize revenue when the consigned implants and related disposables have been implanted or used, or for sets that are sold directly and not consigned, when title to the goods and risk of loss are transferred to customers with no remaining performance obligations which affect the customer's final acceptance of the sale.\nWe completed our first sale of ExcelsiusGPS\u2122 in the fourth quarter of 2017. We generally recognize revenue when control transfers to the customer, which occurs at the time the product is shipped or delivered. Depending on the terms of the arrangement, we may also defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received as we have to satisfy a future performance obligation to provide maintenance and support.\nWe expect to expand our U.S. and international sales forces, which will provide us with significant opportunity to continue to increase our penetration in existing markets and to enter new international markets. We also expect to increase sales by commercializing new products, but expect the increase of sales from new products to be partially offset by decreased sales of earlier-generation products.\nCost of Goods Sold\nWhile we have increased our in-house implant product manufacturing capacity and assemble the ExcelsiusGPS\u2122 system in-house, we also have products manufactured by third-party suppliers. Substantially all of our suppliers manufacture our products in the United States. Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of costs from our in-house manufacturing, costs of products purchased from third-party suppliers, excess and obsolete inventory charges, depreciation of surgical instruments and cases, royalties, shipping, inspection and related costs incurred in making our products available for sale or use. Beginning in January 2013, our cost of goods sold increased as a result of a medical device excise tax ( MDET\u201d) of up to 2.3% on the sale of certain medical devices in the United States. On December 18, 2015, the MDET was suspended for two years effective January 1, 2016. In January 2018, Congress further extended the moratorium on the medical device excise tax through January 1, 2020.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering, product development, clinical and regulatory expenses, consulting services, outside prototyping services, internal and external research activities, materials, depreciation, and other costs associated with development of our products. Research and development expenses also include related personnel and consultants' compensation and stock-based compensation expense. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.\nWe expect to incur additional research and development costs as we continue to develop new products. These costs will increase in absolute terms as we continue to expand our product pipeline and add personnel.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for personnel employed in sales, marketing, finance, legal, compliance, administrative, information technology, medical education and training, quality and human resource departments. Our selling, general and administrative expenses also include commissions, generally based on a percentage of sales, to direct sales representatives and distributors. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute terms with the continued expansion of our sales force and commercialization of our current and pipeline products. We plan to hire more personnel to support the growth of our business.\nProvision for Litigation\nWe record a provision for litigation settlements when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated and in the case of a favorable settlement, income when realized.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nWe amortize finite lived intangible assets over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method and estimated lives ranging from one to seventeen years. Indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If impairment is indicated, we measure the amount of the impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted future cash flow analysis.\nAcquisition Related Costs\nAcquisition related costs represent: the change in fair value of business-acquisition-related contingent consideration; costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses, including but not limited to costs to exit or convert contractual obligations, severance, and information system conversion; and specific costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process such as banker fees, legal fees, and other acquisition related professional fees.\nIncome Tax Provision\nWe are taxed at the rates applicable within each jurisdiction. The composite income tax rate, tax provisions, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by management and the respective governmental taxing authorities, and require us to exercise judgment in determining our income tax provision, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved. See Note 13. Income Taxes\u201d below for further discussion on the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the current year.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods. Certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments, including but not limited to those related to inventories, recoverability of long-lived assets and the fair value of our common stock. We use historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for our judgments and making these estimates. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Any changes in those estimates will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements as they occur. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Part II; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 1. Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d below in this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results. The critical accounting policies addressed below reflect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our Board.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Sales and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as expense. For purposes of disclosing disaggregated revenue, we disaggregate our revenue, into two categories, Musculoskeletal Solutions and Enabling Technologies, based on the timing of revenue recognition. Our Musculoskeletal Solutions products consist primarily of the implantable devices, disposables, and unique instruments used in an expansive range of spine, orthopedic trauma and extremity procedures. The majority of our Musculoskeletal Solutions contracts have a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a point in time. Our Enabling Technologies products are the advanced hardware and software systems and related technologies that are designed to enhance a surgeon's capabilities and streamline surgical procedures by making them less invasive, more accurate, and more reproducible to improve patient care. The majority of our Enabling Technologies product contracts typically contain multiple performance obligations, including maintenance and support, and revenue is recognized as we fulfill each performance obligation. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. Our policy is to classify shipping and handling costs billed to customers as sales and the related expenses as cost of goods sold.\nExcess and Obsolete Inventory. We state inventories at the lower of cost or market. We determine cost on a first-in, first-out basis. The majority of our inventory is finished goods. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventories in relation to the estimated forecast of product demand, which takes into consideration the estimated life cycle of product releases. When quantities on hand exceed estimated sales forecasts, we record a write-down for excess inventories, which results in a corresponding charge to cost of goods sold. Charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventory were $10.5 million, $11.5 million and $12.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe need to maintain substantial levels of inventory impacts the risk of carrying excess inventory. Many of our Musculoskeletal Solutions products come in sets which feature components in a variety of sizes so that the implant or device may be customized to the patient's needs. In order to market our Musculoskeletal Solutions products effectively, we must often maintain and provide surgeons and hospitals with consignment implant sets, back-up products and products of different sizes. For each surgery, fewer than all of the components of the set are used, and therefore certain portions of the set may be considered excess inventory since they are not likely to be used. One of our primary business goals is to focus on continual product innovation. Though we believe this provides us with a competitive advantage, it also increases the risk that our products will become excess or obsolete inventory prior to sale or prior to the end of their anticipated useful lives. When we introduce new products or next-generation products, we may be required to take charges for excess and obsolete inventory that have a significant impact on the value of our inventory or on our operating results.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired less the liabilities assumed. We acquired goodwill in connection with the various acquisitions completed. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a minimum on an annual basis. The fair value is estimated using an income and discounted cash flow approach. We performed our qualitative goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2018 and determined that fair value of our reporting units is substantially in excess of carrying value.\nIntangible assets consist of purchased in-process research and development ( IPR&D\u201d), developed technology, supplier networks, patents, customer relationships and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives ranging from one to seventeen years. Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If impairment is indicated, we measure the amount of the impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted future cash flow analysis.\nIPR&D has an indefinite life and is not amortized until completion and development of the project at which time the IPR&D becomes an amortizable asset. If the related project is not completed in a timely manner, we may have an impairment related to the IPR&D, calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value. During 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $3.5 million as a component of acquisition related costs.\nLong-Lived Assets. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived assets, which include property and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We assess impairment when the undiscounted future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset are less than its carrying value. If impairment is indicated, we measure the amount of the impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. We base our fair value methodology on quoted market prices, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, we estimate fair value based on prices of similar assets or other valuation techniques including present value techniques.\nIncome Taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which such items are expected to be received or settled. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. We establish a valuation allowance to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWhile we believe that our tax positions are fully supportable, there is a risk that certain positions could be challenged successfully. In these instances, we look to establish reserves. If we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that has likelihood greater than 50% of being realized upon settlement. We presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. We regularly monitor our tax positions, tax assets and tax liabilities. We reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit when (i) a tax audit is completed, (ii) applicable tax law, including a tax case or legislative guidance, changes or (iii) the statute of limitations expires. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves.\nLegal Proceedings. We are involved in a number of legal actions involving both product liability and intellectual property disputes. The outcomes of these legal actions are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the claimants seek damages as well as other relief, including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the lawsuit, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost sales. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible, but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded. While it is not possible to predict the outcome for these matters, we believe it is possible that costs associated with them could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings, financial position or cash flows.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense. We measure the cost for employee and non-employee awards at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. For employee awards, we amortize the expense, which is the fair value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest, over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award). We record the awards issued to non-employees at their fair value as determined in accordance with authoritative guidance, and we periodically revalue the awards as they vest, recognizing the expense over the requisite service period. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Our determination of the fair value is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.\nAs we became a publicly traded entity in 2012, historic volatility for our common stock is insufficient to estimate expected volatility. As a result, we estimate volatility based on a consistently defined peer group of public companies that we believe collectively provides a reasonable basis for estimating volatility. We intend to continue to use the consistently defined group of publicly traded peer companies to determine volatility in the future until sufficient information regarding volatility of the price of our shares of Class A common stock becomes available or the selected companies are no longer suitable for this purpose.\nWe also do not have sufficient history of stock option exercises as a public company available that is indicative of future exercise and post-vesting behavior to estimate the expected term after our initial public offering ( IPO\u201d). As a result, we use the simplified method of estimating the expected term, under which the expected term is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the contractual end of the term. We base the risk-free interest rate on observed interest rates of U.S. Treasury securities equivalent to the expected terms of the stock options. We estimate our pre-vesting forfeiture rate based on our historical experience. Our dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of no dividend payouts.\nWe estimate the weighted-average fair value of the options granted using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the\ncalculation of expected term and fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, among other inputs.\nTo the extent that further evidence regarding these variables is available and provides estimates that we believe are more indicative of actual trends, we may refine or change our approach to deriving these input estimates. Any such changes could materially affect the stock-based compensation expense we record in the future.\nWe expect to continue to grant stock options in the future, and to the extent that we do, our actual stock-based compensation expense recognized may increase.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nSales\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our sales by geography expressed as dollar amounts and the changes in sales between the specified periods expressed in dollar amounts and as percentages:\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>593,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>529,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>119,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>712,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>635,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the United States, the increase in sales of $64.0 million was due primarily to increased spine product sales due to penetration in existing territories, INR product sales, and associated implant and robotic instrument sales.\nInternationally, the increase in sales of $13.0 million was due primarily to increased sales in Japan and other existing countries as well as sales of INR product and associated robotic instrument sales.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 13. Income Taxes.\u201d\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures. For example, non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, which represents net income before interest income, net and other non-operating expenses, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, provision for litigation, acquisition related costs/licensing and prior period adjustment excluding depreciation, is useful as an additional measure of operating performance, and particularly as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period, as it is reflective of changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and other factors that affect operating performance, and it removes the effect of our capital structure, asset base, income taxes and interest income and expense. Our management also uses non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections. Provision for litigation represents costs incurred for litigation settlements or unfavorable verdicts when the loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, or in the case of a favorable settlement, when income is realized. Acquisition related costs/licensing represents the change in fair value of business-acquisition-related contingent consideration; costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses, including but not limited to costs to exit or convert contractual obligations, severance, and information system conversion; and specific costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process such as banker fees, legal fees, and other acquisition related professional fees, as well as one-time licensing fees. Prior period adjustment excluding depreciation represents the cumulative impact of prior year adjustments primarily related to a decrease in scrap adjustments of instruments and cases, none of which were individually material to the related year's financial position or results of operations.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net\n</td> <td>(13,278\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,608\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,057\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>32,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>41,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>38,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>216,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>205,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>21,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for litigation\n</td> <td>5,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related costs/licensing\n</td> <td>4,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain from sale of assets\n</td> <td>(3,593\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior period adjustment, excluding depreciation\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,697\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income as a percentage of sales\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Included in this amount for the year ended December 31, 2016 is $5.5 million related to depreciation amounts recognized in the current year related to the prior period adjustment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> For additional information regarding the prior period adjustment, please refer to Part II; Item 8.

Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies; (b) Basis of Presentation.\u201d\nIn addition, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and for other comparative periods, we are presenting non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share, which represents net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the provision for litigation, amortization of intangibles, acquisition related costs/licensing, prior period adjustment and the tax effects of all of the foregoing adjustments. The tax effect adjustment represents the tax effect of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments excluded from non-GAAP net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is calculated based on the consolidated effective tax rate on a GAAP basis, applied to the non-GAAP adjustments, unless the underlying item has a materially different tax treatment, in which case the estimated tax rate applicable to the adjustment is used. At December 31, 2017, we calculated the tax effect of adjusting items utilizing our effective tax rate prior to the one-time Tax Reform Act adjustment. The effective tax rate applied was 30.3%.\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures are also useful indicators of our operating performance, and particularly as additional measures of comparative operating performance from period to period as they remove the effects of litigation, amortization of intangibles, acquisition related costs/licensing, and the tax effects of all of the foregoing adjustments,

We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities, whereby our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. Excess operating cash is primarily used to fund acquisitions to advance the strategic growth of the Company, as well as continue our cash management program to generate returns on our cash and cash equivalents through investing in marketable securities, which include municipal bonds, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, securities of government, federal agency, and other sovereign obligations and asset-backed securities. Our overall cash position reflects our strong business results and a cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity, economic factors and tax considerations. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for further discussion of cash flow results.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due primarily to increased operational cash flows in 2018 related to timing of spending and cash receipts.\nThe decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to the timing of collection and billing of trade accounts receivable, which was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due primarily to higher investment in marketable securities and increased purchases of property and equipment, which was partially offset by the cash received from collection of the note receivable.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to higher investment in marketable securities and increased purchases of property and equipment, which was partially offset by the decrease in cash used for the acquisition of businesses.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\nThe increase in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due primarily to higher proceeds from exercises of stock options, which was partially offset by payments for business acquisition liabilities.\nThe increase in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to proceeds from exercises of stock options, which was partially offset by payments for business acquisition liabilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table highlights certain information related to our liquidity and capital resources:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term marketable securities\n</td> <td>199,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>254,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term marketable securities\n</td> <td>263,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>602,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>429,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities increased $173.0 million, primarily as a result of our cash provided by operating activities and increased investment in marketable securities. Our investment in marketable securities includes municipal bonds, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, U.S. treasuries, securities of government, federal agency, and other sovereign obligations and asset-backed securities, and are classified as available-for-sale as of December 31, 2018.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company identified and recorded an adjustment to its December 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet to correct the presentation of $65.8 million of its Variable Rate Demand Notes ( VRDNs\u201d) as short-term marketable securities instead of cash and cash equivalents (see Part II; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 1. Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d)\nOn June 13, 2017, we acquired the international operations and distribution channel of KB Medical SA for $31.5 million in cash, subject to certain closing adjustments (see Part II; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 2. Acquisitions.\u201d)\nIn May 2011, we entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank related to a revolving credit facility that provides for borrowings up to $50.0 million. In June 2018, we amended the credit agreement to increase the revolving credit facility amount from $50.0 million to $125.0 million. At our request, and with the approval of the bank, the amount of borrowings available under the revolving credit facility can be increased to $150.0 million. The revolving credit facility includes up to a $25.0 million sub-limit for letters of credit. As amended to date, the revolving credit facility expires in May 2019. Cash advances bear interest at our option either at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the daily LIBOR in effect for a one-month period plus 0.75%, or a fixed rate for a one- or three-month period equal to LIBOR plus 0.75%. The credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility also subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including the requirement to maintain maximum consolidated leverage. The covenants also include limitations on our ability to repurchase shares, to pay cash dividends or to enter into a sale transaction. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the credit agreement, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and available borrowings were $125.0 million. We may terminate the credit agreement at any time on ten days' notice without premium or penalty.\nIn addition to our existing cash and marketable securities balances, our principal sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities and our revolving credit facility, which was fully available as of December 31, 2018. We believe these sources will provide sufficient liquidity for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Our principal liquidity requirements are to meet our working capital, research and development, including clinical trials, and capital expenditure needs, principally for our surgical sets required to maintain and expand our business and potential future business or intellectual property acquisitions. We expect to continue to make investments in surgical sets as we launch new products, increase the size of our U.S. sales force, and expand into international markets. We may, however, require additional liquidity as we continue to execute our business strategy. Our liquidity may be negatively impacted as a result of a decline in sales of our products, including declines due to changes in our customers' ability to obtain third-party coverage and reimbursement for procedures that use our products, increased pricing pressures resulting from intensifying competition, cost increases and slower product development cycles resulting from a changing regulatory environment; and unfavorable results from litigation which will affect our cash flow. We anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the incurrence of other indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of liquidity. The sale of additional equity may result in dilution to our stockholders. There is no assurance that we will be able to secure such additional funding on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d sections of this Annual Report for a discussion of certain of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements described in the following discussion and analysis. Certain amounts and percentages in this discussion and analysis have been rounded for convenience of presentation.\nOverview\nWe are an engineering-driven company with a history of rapidly developing and commercializing advanced products and procedures to address treatment challenges. With over 190 products on the market, we offer a comprehensive portfolio of innovative and differentiated technologies that treat a variety of musculoskeletal conditions of the spine, extremities and pelvis. Although we manage our business globally within one operating segment, we separate our products into two major categories: Musculoskeletal Solutions and Enabling Technologies.\nMusculoskeletal Solutions\nMusculoskeletal Solutions consist primarily of implantable devices, biologics, accessories, and unique surgical instruments used in an expansive range of spinal, orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures.\nOur broad spectrum of spine products addresses the vast majority of conditions affecting the spine including degenerative conditions, deformity, tumors, and trauma. With more than fifteen years in this competitive market, we provide comprehensive solutions that facilitate both open and minimally invasive surgery ( MIS\u201d) techniques. This includes traditional fusion implants such as pedicle screw and rod systems, plating systems, intervertebral spacers and corpectomy devices. We believe we pioneered innovative expandable solutions for interbody fusion, corpectomy and interspinous fixation that allow intraoperative customization of our devices to the patient's anatomy and save surgical time by eliminating sequential trialing. We have also developed treatment options for motion preservation technologies, such as dynamic stabilization, total disc replacement and interspinous distraction devices; and interventional pain management solutions to treat vertebral compression fractures. Regenerative biologic products such as allografts and synthetic alternatives are adjunctive treatments typically used in combination with stabilizing implant hardware.\nOur orthopedic trauma solutions are designed to treat a wide variety of orthopedic fracture patterns and patient anatomies in the upper and lower extremities as well as the hip. To date, Globus has received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) for numerous orthopedic trauma and extremity products, covering four major segments of the orthopedic trauma market - fracture plates, compression screws, intramedullary nails, and external fixation. We began marketing these products in 2018 and intend to grow our presence in this field. Fracture plating includes proximal humerus, distal radius, proximal tibia, distal fibula, small fragment, mini-fragment and clavicle plates. Intramedullary nailing includes tibial, trochanteric, and femoral nail systems. Regenerative biologic products such as bone void fillers and allograft struts are also used in orthopedic procedures where applicable.\nEnabling Technologies\nEnabling Technologies are advanced computer-assisted intelligent systems designed to enhance a surgeon's capabilities and streamline surgical procedures to be safer, less invasive, more accurate, and more reproducible, to ultimately improve patient care and reduce radiation exposure for all involved.\nOur current enabling technologies are comprised of imaging, navigation and robotic ( INR\u201d) assisted surgery solutions. This includes the ExcelsiusGPS\u00ae platform, a robotic guidance and navigation system that supports minimally invasive and open procedures with screw placement applications. The ExcelsiusGPS\u00ae platform has a modular design that can be used for a variety of screw placement applications, and we expect that it will serve as a foundation for future clinical applications using artificial intelligence and augmented reality.\nGlobus' innovative Enabling Technologies products offer surgeons more information about patient anatomy and surgical options to help them to make well-informed surgical decisions. We believe the advantages of pre-planning implant position and viewing patient anatomy during surgery are self-evident, and also create significant secondary gains such as eliminating radiation exposure altogether.\nWhile we group our products into two categories, they are not limited to a particular technology, platform or surgical approach. Instead, our goal is to offer a comprehensive product suite that can be used to effectively treat patients based on their specific anatomy and condition, and is customized to the surgeon's training and surgical preference.\nTo date, the primary market for our products has been the United States, where we sell our products through a combination of direct sales representatives employed by us and distributor sales representatives employed by our exclusive independent distributors, who distribute our products on our behalf for a commission that is generally based on a percentage of sales. We believe there is significant opportunity to strengthen our position in the U.S. market by increasing the size of our U.S. sales force and we intend to add additional direct and distributor sales representatives in the future.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our international sales accounted for approximately 17% of our total sales. We currently sell our products in 51 countries outside the United States through a combination of direct sales representatives employed by us and exclusive international distributors. We believe there are significant opportunities for us to increase our presence in both existing and new international markets through the continued expansion of our direct and distributor sales forces and the commercialization of additional products.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nWe manage our business globally within one operating segment, which is consistent with how our management reviews our business, makes investment and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance.\nSales\nToday, we sell primarily implants and related disposables, primarily to hospitals, for use by surgeons to treat musculoskeletal disorders. We generally consign our surgical sets, which contain our implants, disposables, surgical instruments and cases to our sales representatives, and the sets are maintained with the sales representatives or at our hospital customers that purchase the implants and related disposables used in the surgeries. We recognize revenue when the consigned implants and related disposables have been implanted or used, or for sets that are sold directly and not consigned, when title to the goods and risk of loss are transferred to customers with no remaining performance obligations which affect the customer's final acceptance of the sale.\nWe completed our first sale of ExcelsiusGPS\u2122 in the fourth quarter of 2017. We generally recognize revenue when control transfers to the customer, which occurs at the time the product is shipped or delivered. Depending on the terms of the arrangement, we may also defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received as we have to satisfy a future performance obligation to provide maintenance and support.\nWe expect to expand our U.S. and international sales forces, which will provide us with significant opportunity to continue to increase our penetration in existing markets and to enter new international markets. We also expect to increase sales by commercializing new products, but expect the increase of sales from new products to be partially offset by decreased sales of earlier-generation products.\nCost of Goods Sold\nWhile we have increased our in-house implant product manufacturing capacity and assemble the ExcelsiusGPS\u2122 system in-house, we also have products manufactured by third-party suppliers. Substantially all of our suppliers manufacture our products in the United States. Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of costs from our in-house manufacturing, costs of products purchased from third-party suppliers, excess and obsolete inventory charges, depreciation of surgical instruments and cases, royalties, shipping, inspection and related costs incurred in making our products available for sale or use. Beginning in January 2013, our cost of goods sold increased as a result of a medical device excise tax ( MDET\u201d) of up to 2.3% on the sale of certain medical devices in the United States. On December 18, 2015, the MDET was suspended for two years effective January 1, 2016. In January 2018, Congress further extended the moratorium on the medical device excise tax through January 1, 2020.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering, product development, clinical and regulatory expenses, consulting services, outside prototyping services, internal and external research activities, materials, depreciation, and other costs associated with development of our products. Research and development expenses also include related personnel and consultants' compensation and stock-based compensation expense. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.\nWe expect to incur additional research and development costs as we continue to develop new products. These costs will increase in absolute terms as we continue to expand our product pipeline and add personnel.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for personnel employed in sales, marketing, finance, legal, compliance, administrative, information technology, medical education and training, quality and human resource departments. Our selling, general and administrative expenses also include commissions, generally based on a percentage of sales, to direct sales representatives and distributors. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute terms with the continued expansion of our sales force and commercialization of our current and pipeline products. We plan to hire more personnel to support the growth of our business.\nProvision for Litigation\nWe record a provision for litigation settlements when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated and in the case of a favorable settlement, income when realized.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nWe amortize finite lived intangible assets over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method and estimated lives ranging from one to seventeen years. Indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If impairment is indicated, we measure the amount of the impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted future cash flow analysis.\nAcquisition Related Costs\nAcquisition related costs represent: the change in fair value of business-acquisition-related contingent consideration; costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses, including but not limited to costs to exit or convert contractual obligations, severance, and information system conversion; and specific costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process such as banker fees, legal fees, and other acquisition related professional fees.\nIncome Tax Provision\nWe are taxed at the rates applicable within each jurisdiction. The composite income tax rate, tax provisions, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by management and the respective governmental taxing authorities, and require us to exercise judgment in determining our income tax provision, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved. See Note 13. Income Taxes\u201d below for further discussion on the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the current year.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods. Certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments, including but not limited to those related to inventories, recoverability of long-lived assets and the fair value of our common stock. We use historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for our judgments and making these estimates. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Any changes in those estimates will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements as they occur. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Part II; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 1. Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d below in this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results. The critical accounting policies addressed below reflect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our Board.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Sales and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as expense. For purposes of disclosing disaggregated revenue, we disaggregate our revenue, into two categories, Musculoskeletal Solutions and Enabling Technologies, based on the timing of revenue recognition. Our Musculoskeletal Solutions products consist primarily of the implantable devices, disposables, and unique instruments used in an expansive range of spine, orthopedic trauma and extremity procedures. The majority of our Musculoskeletal Solutions contracts have a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a point in time. Our Enabling Technologies products are the advanced hardware and software systems and related technologies that are designed to enhance a surgeon's capabilities and streamline surgical procedures by making them less invasive, more accurate, and more reproducible to improve patient care. The majority of our Enabling Technologies product contracts typically contain multiple performance obligations, including maintenance and support, and revenue is recognized as we fulfill each performance obligation. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. Our policy is to classify shipping and handling costs billed to customers as sales and the related expenses as cost of goods sold.\nExcess and Obsolete Inventory. We state inventories at the lower of cost or market. We determine cost on a first-in, first-out basis. The majority of our inventory is finished goods. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventories in relation to the estimated forecast of product demand, which takes into consideration the estimated life cycle of product releases. When quantities on hand exceed estimated sales forecasts, we record a write-down for excess inventories, which results in a corresponding charge to cost of goods sold. Charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventory were $10.5 million, $11.5 million and $12.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe need to maintain substantial levels of inventory impacts the risk of carrying excess inventory. Many of our Musculoskeletal Solutions products come in sets which feature components in a variety of sizes so that the implant or device may be customized to the patient's needs. In order to market our Musculoskeletal Solutions products effectively, we must often maintain and provide surgeons and hospitals with consignment implant sets, back-up products and products of different sizes. For each surgery, fewer than all of the components of the set are used, and therefore certain portions of the set may be considered excess inventory since they are not likely to be used. One of our primary business goals is to focus on continual product innovation. Though we believe this provides us with a competitive advantage, it also increases the risk that our products will become excess or obsolete inventory prior to sale or prior to the end of their anticipated useful lives. When we introduce new products or next-generation products, we may be required to take charges for excess and obsolete inventory that have a significant impact on the value of our inventory or on our operating results.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired less the liabilities assumed. We acquired goodwill in connection with the various acquisitions completed. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a minimum on an annual basis. The fair value is estimated using an income and discounted cash flow approach. We performed our qualitative goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2018 and determined that fair value of our reporting units is substantially in excess of carrying value.\nIntangible assets consist of purchased in-process research and development ( IPR&D\u201d), developed technology, supplier networks, patents, customer relationships and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives ranging from one to seventeen years. Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If impairment is indicated, we measure the amount of the impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted future cash flow analysis.\nIPR&D has an indefinite life and is not amortized until completion and development of the project at which time the IPR&D becomes an amortizable asset. If the related project is not completed in a timely manner, we may have an impairment related to the IPR&D, calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value. During 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $3.5 million as a component of acquisition related costs.\nLong-Lived Assets. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived assets, which include property and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We assess impairment when the undiscounted future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset are less than its carrying value. If impairment is indicated, we measure the amount of the impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. We base our fair value methodology on quoted market prices, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, we estimate fair value based on prices of similar assets or other valuation techniques including present value techniques.\nIncome Taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which such items are expected to be received or settled. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. We establish a valuation allowance to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWhile we believe that our tax positions are fully supportable, there is a risk that certain positions could be challenged successfully. In these instances, we look to establish reserves. If we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that has likelihood greater than 50% of being realized upon settlement. We presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. We regularly monitor our tax positions, tax assets and tax liabilities. We reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit when (i) a tax audit is completed, (ii) applicable tax law, including a tax case or legislative guidance, changes or (iii) the statute of limitations expires. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves.\nLegal Proceedings. We are involved in a number of legal actions involving both product liability and intellectual property disputes. The outcomes of these legal actions are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the claimants seek damages as well as other relief, including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the lawsuit, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost sales. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible, but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded. While it is not possible to predict the outcome for these matters, we believe it is possible that costs associated with them could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings, financial position or cash flows.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense. We measure the cost for employee and non-employee awards at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. For employee awards, we amortize the expense, which is the fair value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest, over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award). We record the awards issued to non-employees at their fair value as determined in accordance with authoritative guidance, and we periodically revalue the awards as they vest, recognizing the expense over the requisite service period. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Our determination of the fair value is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.\nAs we became a publicly traded entity in 2012, historic volatility for our common stock is insufficient to estimate expected volatility. As a result, we estimate volatility based on a consistently defined peer group of public companies that we believe collectively provides a reasonable basis for estimating volatility. We intend to continue to use the consistently defined group of publicly traded peer companies to determine volatility in the future until sufficient information regarding volatility of the price of our shares of Class A common stock becomes available or the selected companies are no longer suitable for this purpose.\nWe also do not have sufficient history of stock option exercises as a public company available that is indicative of future exercise and post-vesting behavior to estimate the expected term after our initial public offering ( IPO\u201d). As a result, we use the simplified method of estimating the expected term, under which the expected term is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the contractual end of the term. We base the risk-free interest rate on observed interest rates of U.S. Treasury securities equivalent to the expected terms of the stock options. We estimate our pre-vesting forfeiture rate based on our historical experience. Our dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of no dividend payouts.\nWe estimate the weighted-average fair value of the options granted using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the\ncalculation of expected term and fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, among other inputs.\nTo the extent that further evidence regarding these variables is available and provides estimates that we believe are more indicative of actual trends, we may refine or change our approach to deriving these input estimates. Any such changes could materially affect the stock-based compensation expense we record in the future.\nWe expect to continue to grant stock options in the future, and to the extent that we do, our actual stock-based compensation expense recognized may increase.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nSales\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our sales by geography expressed as dollar amounts and the changes in sales between the specified periods expressed in dollar amounts and as percentages:\n\nIn the United States, the increase in sales of $64.0 million was due primarily to increased spine product sales due to penetration in existing territories, INR product sales, and associated implant and robotic instrument sales.\nInternationally, the increase in sales of $13.0 million was due primarily to increased sales in Japan and other existing countries as well as sales of INR product and associated robotic instrument sales. On a constant currency basis, our international sales grew $11.5 million, or by 10.8%, and our worldwide sales increased by 11.9%.\nCost of Goods Sold\n\nThe increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to higher volumes and was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation of $5.7 million primarily resulting from the change in accounting estimate for the depreciable lives of our instruments and cases.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\nThe increase in research and development expenses was due primarily to an increase in employee compensation costs from additional headcount, including our INR technology group, increased supplies for furthering research activities and developing new innovative products, and an increase of $1.8 million from one-time technology licensing fees.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nThe increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases of $18.1 million of costs to build the INR technology and orthopedic trauma sales forces, and a $12.6 million increase in the U.S. sales force expenses. Additionally, there were increases in stock based compensation expenses of $5.1 million.\nProvision for Litigation\n\nThe increase in the provision for litigation was primarily due to the settlement of the L5 litigation, as well as other settlement payments and costs recorded in the period.\nFor additional information regarding litigation, please refer to Part II; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nAmortization of Intangibles\n\nThe increase in the amortization of intangibles is primarily due to the developed technology intangible asset acquired in connection with the Nemaris acquisition.\nAcquisition Related Costs\n\nAcquisition related costs remained consistent for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther Income, Net\n\nThe increase in other income, net, is due primarily to the gain on sale of assets of $4.6 million and increases in interest income from marketable securities and the Alphatec Credit Agreement of $6.7 million. For additional information regarding the note receivable with Alphatec Spine Inc., please refer to Part II; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 3. Note Receivable.\u201d\nIncome Tax Provision\n\nThe change in the effective income tax rate between the current year and prior year periods is primarily driven by the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Reform Act\u201d) as further described in Part II; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 13. Income Taxes.\u201d and stock option exercise benefit.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nSales\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our sales by geography expressed as dollar amounts and the changes in sales between the specified periods expressed in dollar amounts and as percentages:\n\nIn the United States, the increase in sales of $29.7 million was due primarily to expansion into new territories and increased penetration in existing territories.\nInternationally, the increase in sales of $42.3 million was primarily due to incremental sales from the Alphatec International acquisition. On a constant currency basis, our international sales grew $41.1 million, or by 66.9%, due to expansion into new international territories. Our worldwide sales increased 12.8% on a constant currency basis.\nCost of Goods Sold\n\nThe increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to increases from higher volumes, product mix and inventory write offs. Partially offsetting these increases was a cost benefit of $4.0 million from in-house manufacturing.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\nThe decrease in research and development expenses was due primarily to $4.0 million of one-time licensing costs incurred in 2016, which was partially offset by increased investment into INR technology and orthopedic trauma for additional headcount to further research activities and development of new innovative products.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nThe increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increases of $15.8 million of costs to support Alphatec International sales, $9.5 million of costs to build the INR technology and orthopedic trauma sales forces, and a $10.1 million increase in the U.S. sales force expenses. In addition, there were cost increases of $6.5 million related to general and administrative compensation costs.\nProvision for Litigation\n\nThe current year provision for litigation, which is relatively consistent with the prior year provision, includes legal settlement and verdict costs.\nAmortization of Intangibles\n\nThe increase in the amortization of intangibles is primarily due to intangible assets acquired in connection with the Alphatec International acquisition.\nAcquisition Related Costs\n\nAcquisition related costs remained consistent for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The current year balance primarily consists of costs associated with the KB Medical acquisition.\nOther Income, Net\n\nThe increase in other income, net is due primarily to increases in interest income from increased average investment balances and the note receivable with Alphatec Spine Inc., coupled with increases in foreign exchange transaction gains. For additional information regarding the note receivable with Alphatec Spine Inc., please refer to Part II; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 3. Note Receivable.\u201d\nIncome Tax Provision\n\nOur tax provision and effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was higher than the prior year due primarily to the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Reform Act\u201d), as further described in Part II; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 13. Income Taxes.\u201d\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures. For example, non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, which represents net income before interest income, net and other non-operating expenses, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, provision for litigation, acquisition related costs/licensing and prior period adjustment excluding depreciation, is useful as an additional measure of operating performance, and particularly as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period, as it is reflective of changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and other factors that affect operating performance, and it removes the effect of our capital structure, asset base, income taxes and interest income and expense. Our management also uses non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections. Provision for litigation represents costs incurred for litigation settlements or unfavorable verdicts when the loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, or in the case of a favorable settlement, when income is realized. Acquisition related costs/licensing represents the change in fair value of business-acquisition-related contingent consideration; costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses, including but not limited to costs to exit or convert contractual obligations, severance, and information system conversion; and specific costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process such as banker fees, legal fees, and other acquisition related professional fees, as well as one-time licensing fees. Prior period adjustment excluding depreciation represents the cumulative impact of prior year adjustments primarily related to a decrease in scrap adjustments of instruments and cases, none of which were individually material to the related year's financial position or results of operations.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\n\n______________\n * Included in this amount for the year ended December 31, 2016 is $5.5 million related to depreciation amounts recognized in the current year related to the prior period adjustment.  For additional information regarding the prior period adjustment, please refer to Part II; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 1. Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies; (b) Basis of Presentation.\u201d\nIn addition, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and for other comparative periods, we are presenting non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share, which represents net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the provision for litigation, amortization of intangibles, acquisition related costs/licensing, prior period adjustment and the tax effects of all of the foregoing adjustments. The tax effect adjustment represents the tax effect of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments excluded from non-GAAP net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is calculated based on the consolidated effective tax rate on a GAAP basis, applied to the non-GAAP adjustments, unless the underlying item has a materially different tax treatment, in which case the estimated tax rate applicable to the adjustment is used. At December 31, 2017, we calculated the tax effect of adjusting items utilizing our effective tax rate prior to the one-time Tax Reform Act adjustment. The effective tax rate applied was 30.3%.\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures are also useful indicators of our operating performance, and particularly as additional measures of comparative operating performance from period to period as they remove the effects of litigation, amortization of intangibles, acquisition related costs/licensing, and the tax effects of all of the foregoing adjustments, which we believe are not reflective of underlying business trends.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP net income for the periods presented.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of Diluted Earnings Per Share as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share for the periods presented.\n\nWe also define the non-GAAP measure of Free Cash Flow as the net cash provided by operating activities, adjusted for the impact of restricted cash, less the cash impact of purchases of property and equipment. We believe that this financial measure provides meaningful information for evaluating our overall financial performance for comparative periods as it facilitates an assessment of funds available to satisfy current and future obligations and fund acquisitions.\nBelow is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Free Cash Flow for the periods presented.\n\nFurthermore, the non-GAAP measure of constant currency sales growth is calculated by translating current year sales at the same average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior year period. We believe constant currency sales growth provides insight to the comparative increase or decrease in period sales, in dollar and percentage terms, excluding the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nBelow is a reconciliation of sales growth as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP compared to constant currency sales growth for the periods presented.\n\n\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share, Free Cash Flow and constant currency sales growth are not calculated in conformity with U.S. GAAP within the meaning of Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures do not include certain expenses that may be necessary to evaluate our liquidity or operating results. Our definitions of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share, Free Cash Flow and constant currency sales growth may differ from that of other companies and therefore may not be comparable. Additionally, we have recast prior periods for non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share to conform with current period presentation.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:\n\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $602.8 million and $429.8 million, respectively. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities, whereby our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. Excess operating cash is primarily used to fund acquisitions to advance the strategic growth of the Company, as well as continue our cash management program to generate returns on our cash and cash equivalents through investing in marketable securities, which include municipal bonds, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, securities of government, federal agency, and other sovereign obligations and asset-backed securities. Our overall cash position reflects our strong business results and a cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity, economic factors and tax considerations. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for further discussion of cash flow results.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due primarily to increased operational cash flows in 2018 related to timing of spending and cash receipts.\nThe decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to the timing of collection and billing of trade accounts receivable, which was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due primarily to higher investment in marketable securities and increased purchases of property and equipment, which was partially offset by the cash received from collection of the note receivable.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to higher investment in marketable securities and increased purchases of property and equipment, which was partially offset by the decrease in cash used for the acquisition of businesses.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\nThe increase in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due primarily to higher proceeds from exercises of stock options, which was partially offset by payments for business acquisition liabilities.\nThe increase in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to proceeds from exercises of stock options, which was partially offset by payments for business acquisition liabilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table highlights certain information related to our liquidity and capital resources:\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities increased $173.0 million, primarily as a result of our cash provided by operating activities and increased investment in marketable securities. Our investment in marketable securities includes municipal bonds, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, U.S. treasuries, securities of government, federal agency, and other sovereign obligations and asset-backed securities, and are classified as available-for-sale as of December 31, 2018.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company identified and recorded an adjustment to its December 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet to correct the presentation of $65.8 million of its Variable Rate Demand Notes ( VRDNs\u201d) as short-term marketable securities instead of cash and cash equivalents (see Part II; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 1. Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d)\nOn June 13, 2017, we acquired the international operations and distribution channel of KB Medical SA for $31.5 million in cash, subject to certain closing adjustments (see Part II; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 2. Acquisitions.\u201d)\nIn May 2011, we entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank related to a revolving credit facility that provides for borrowings up to $50.0 million. In June 2018, we amended the credit agreement to increase the revolving credit facility amount from $50.0 million to $125.0 million. At our request, and with the approval of the bank, the amount of borrowings available under the revolving credit facility can be increased to $150.0 million. The revolving credit facility includes up to a $25.0 million sub-limit for letters of credit. As amended to date, the revolving credit facility expires in May 2019. Cash advances bear interest at our option either at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the daily LIBOR in effect for a one-month period plus 0.75%, or a fixed rate for a one- or three-month period equal to LIBOR plus 0.75%. The credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility also subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including the requirement to maintain maximum consolidated leverage. The covenants also include limitations on our ability to repurchase shares, to pay cash dividends or to enter into a sale transaction. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the credit agreement, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and available borrowings were $125.0 million. We may terminate the credit agreement at any time on ten days' notice without premium or penalty.\nIn addition to our existing cash and marketable securities balances, our principal sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities and our revolving credit facility, which was fully available as of December 31, 2018. We believe these sources will provide sufficient liquidity for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Our principal liquidity requirements are to meet our working capital, research and development, including clinical trials, and capital expenditure needs, principally for our surgical sets required to maintain and expand our business and potential future business or intellectual property acquisitions. We expect to continue to make investments in surgical sets as we launch new products, increase the size of our U.S. sales force, and expand into international markets. We may, however, require additional liquidity as we continue to execute our business strategy. Our liquidity may be negatively impacted as a result of a decline in sales of our products, including declines due to changes in our customers' ability to obtain third-party coverage and reimbursement for procedures that use our products, increased pricing pressures resulting from intensifying competition, cost increases and slower product development cycles resulting from a changing regulatory environment; and unfavorable results from litigation which will affect our cash flow. We anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the incurrence of other indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of liquidity. The sale of additional equity may result in dilution to our stockholders. There is no assurance that we will be able to secure such additional funding on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018. There have been no material changes in our remaining contractual obligations since that time.\n\n______________\n (1) Reflects minimum annual volume commitments to purchase inventory under certain of our supplier contracts as well as costs related to service", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d sections of this Annual Report for a discussion of certain of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements described in the following discussion and analysis. Certain amounts and percentages in this discussion and analysis have been rounded for convenience of presentation.\nOverview\nWe are an engineering-driven company with a history of rapidly developing and commercializing advanced products and procedures to address treatment challenges. With over 190 products on the market, we offer a comprehensive portfolio of innovative and differentiated technologies that treat a variety of musculoskeletal conditions of the spine, extremities and pelvis. Although we manage our business globally within one operating segment, we separate our products into two major categories: Musculoskeletal Solutions and Enabling Technologies.\nMusculoskeletal Solutions\nMusculoskeletal Solutions consist primarily of implantable devices, biologics, accessories, and unique surgical instruments used in an expansive range of spinal, orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures.\nOur broad spectrum of spine products addresses the vast majority of conditions affecting the spine including degenerative conditions, deformity, tumors, and trauma. With more than fifteen years in this competitive market, we provide comprehensive solutions that facilitate both open and minimally invasive surgery ( MIS\u201d) techniques. This includes traditional fusion implants such as pedicle screw and rod systems, plating systems, intervertebral spacers and corpectomy devices. We believe we pioneered innovative expandable solutions for interbody fusion, corpectomy and interspinous fixation that allow intraoperative customization of our devices to the patient's anatomy and save surgical time by eliminating sequential trialing. We have also developed treatment options for motion preservation technologies, such as dynamic stabilization, total disc replacement and interspinous distraction devices; and interventional pain management solutions to treat vertebral compression fractures. Regenerative biologic products such as allografts and synthetic alternatives are adjunctive treatments typically used in combination with stabilizing implant hardware.\nOur orthopedic trauma solutions are designed to treat a wide variety of orthopedic fracture patterns and patient anatomies in the upper and lower extremities as well as the hip. To date, Globus has received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) for numerous orthopedic trauma and extremity products, covering four major segments of the orthopedic trauma market - fracture plates, compression screws, intramedullary nails, and external fixation. We began marketing these products in 2018 and intend to grow our presence in this field. Fracture plating includes proximal humerus, distal radius, proximal tibia, distal fibula, small fragment, mini-fragment and clavicle plates. Intramedullary nailing includes tibial, trochanteric, and femoral nail systems. Regenerative biologic products such as bone void fillers and allograft struts are also used in orthopedic procedures where applicable.\nEnabling Technologies\nEnabling Technologies are advanced computer-assisted intelligent systems designed to enhance a surgeon's capabilities and streamline surgical procedures to be safer, less invasive, more accurate, and more reproducible, to ultimately improve patient care and reduce radiation exposure for all involved.\nOur current enabling technologies are comprised of imaging, navigation and robotic ( INR\u201d) assisted surgery solutions. This includes the ExcelsiusGPS\u00ae platform, a robotic guidance and navigation system that supports minimally invasive and open procedures with screw placement applications. The ExcelsiusGPS\u00ae platform has a modular design that can be used for a variety of screw placement applications, and we expect that it will serve as a foundation for future clinical applications using artificial intelligence and augmented reality.\nGlobus' innovative Enabling Technologies products offer surgeons more information about patient anatomy and surgical options to help them to make well-informed surgical decisions. We believe the advantages of pre-planning implant position and viewing patient anatomy during surgery are self-evident, and also create significant secondary gains such as eliminating radiation exposure altogether.\nWhile we group our products into two categories, they are not limited to a particular technology, platform or surgical approach. Instead, our goal is to offer a comprehensive product suite that can be used to effectively treat patients based on their specific anatomy and condition, and is customized to the surgeon's training and surgical preference.\nTo date, the primary market for our products has been the United States, where we sell our products through a combination of direct sales representatives employed by us and distributor sales representatives employed by our exclusive independent distributors, who distribute our products on our behalf for a commission that is generally based on a percentage of sales. We believe there is significant opportunity to strengthen our position in the U.S. market by increasing the size of our U.S. sales force and we intend to add additional direct and distributor sales representatives in the future.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our international sales accounted for approximately 17% of our total sales. We currently sell our products in 51 countries outside the United States through a combination of direct sales representatives employed by us and exclusive international distributors. We believe there are significant opportunities for us to increase our presence in both existing and new international markets through the continued expansion of our direct and distributor sales forces and the commercialization of additional products.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nWe manage our business globally within one operating segment, which is consistent with how our management reviews our business, makes investment and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance.\nSales\nToday, we sell primarily implants and related disposables, primarily to hospitals, for use by surgeons to treat musculoskeletal disorders. We generally consign our surgical sets, which contain our implants, disposables, surgical instruments and cases to our sales representatives, and the sets are maintained with the sales representatives or at our hospital customers that purchase the implants and related disposables used in the surgeries. We recognize revenue when the consigned implants and related disposables have been implanted or used, or for sets that are sold directly and not consigned, when title to the goods and risk of loss are transferred to customers with no remaining performance obligations which affect the customer's final acceptance of the sale.\nWe completed our first sale of ExcelsiusGPS\u2122 in the fourth quarter of 2017. We generally recognize revenue when control transfers to the customer, which occurs at the time the product is shipped or delivered. Depending on the terms of the arrangement, we may also defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received as we have to satisfy a future performance obligation to provide maintenance and support.\nWe expect to expand our U.S. and international sales forces, which will provide us with significant opportunity to continue to increase our penetration in existing markets and to enter new international markets. We also expect to increase sales by commercializing new products, but expect the increase of sales from new products to be partially offset by decreased sales of earlier-generation products.\nCost of Goods Sold\nWhile we have increased our in-house implant product manufacturing capacity and assemble the ExcelsiusGPS\u2122 system in-house, we also have products manufactured by third-party suppliers. Substantially all of our suppliers manufacture our products in the United States. Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of costs from our in-house manufacturing, costs of products purchased from third-party suppliers, excess and obsolete inventory charges, depreciation of surgical instruments and cases, royalties, shipping, inspection and related costs incurred in making our products available for sale or use. Beginning in January 2013, our cost of goods sold increased as a result of a medical device excise tax ( MDET\u201d) of up to 2.3% on the sale of certain medical devices in the United States. On December 18, 2015, the MDET was suspended for two years effective January 1, 2016. In January 2018, Congress further extended the moratorium on the medical device excise tax through January 1, 2020.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering, product development, clinical and regulatory expenses, consulting services, outside prototyping services, internal and external research activities, materials, depreciation, and other costs associated with development of our products. Research and development expenses also include related personnel and consultants' compensation and stock-based compensation expense. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.\nWe expect to incur additional research and development costs as we continue to develop new products. These costs will increase in absolute terms as we continue to expand our product pipeline and add personnel.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for personnel employed in sales, marketing, finance, legal, compliance, administrative, information technology, medical education and training, quality and human resource departments. Our selling, general and administrative expenses also include commissions, generally based on a percentage of sales, to direct sales representatives and distributors. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute terms with the continued expansion of our sales force and commercialization of our current and pipeline products. We plan to hire more personnel to support the growth of our business.\nProvision for Litigation\nWe record a provision for litigation settlements when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated and in the case of a favorable settlement, income when realized.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nWe amortize finite lived intangible assets over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method and estimated lives ranging from one to seventeen years. Indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If impairment is indicated, we measure the amount of the impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted future cash flow analysis.\nAcquisition Related Costs\nAcquisition related costs represent: the change in fair value of business-acquisition-related contingent consideration; costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses, including but not limited to costs to exit or convert contractual obligations, severance, and information system conversion; and specific costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process such as banker fees, legal fees, and other acquisition related professional fees.\nIncome Tax Provision\nWe are taxed at the rates applicable within each jurisdiction. The composite income tax rate, tax provisions, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by management and the respective governmental taxing authorities, and require us to exercise judgment in determining our income tax provision, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved. See Note 13. Income Taxes\u201d below for further discussion on the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the current year.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods. Certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments, including but not limited to those related to inventories, recoverability of long-lived assets and the fair value of our common stock. We use historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for our judgments and making these estimates. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Any changes in those estimates will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements as they occur. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Part II; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 1. Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d below in this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results. The critical accounting policies addressed below reflect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our Board.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Sales and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as expense. For purposes of disclosing disaggregated revenue, we disaggregate our revenue, into two categories, Musculoskeletal Solutions and Enabling Technologies, based on the timing of revenue recognition. Our Musculoskeletal Solutions products consist primarily of the implantable devices, disposables, and unique instruments used in an expansive range of spine, orthopedic trauma and extremity procedures. The majority of our Musculoskeletal Solutions contracts have a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a point in time. Our Enabling Technologies products are the advanced hardware and software systems and related technologies that are designed to enhance a surgeon's capabilities and streamline surgical procedures by making them less invasive, more accurate, and more reproducible to improve patient care. The majority of our Enabling Technologies product contracts typically contain multiple performance obligations, including maintenance and support, and revenue is recognized as we fulfill each performance obligation. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. Our policy is to classify shipping and handling costs billed to customers as sales and the related expenses as cost of goods sold.\nExcess and Obsolete Inventory. We state inventories at the lower of cost or market. We determine cost on a first-in, first-out basis. The majority of our inventory is finished goods. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventories in relation to the estimated forecast of product demand, which takes into consideration the estimated life cycle of product releases. When quantities on hand exceed estimated sales forecasts, we record a write-down for excess inventories, which results in a corresponding charge to cost of goods sold. Charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventory were $10.5 million, $11.5 million and $12.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe need to maintain substantial levels of inventory impacts the risk of carrying excess inventory. Many of our Musculoskeletal Solutions products come in sets which feature components in a variety of sizes so that the implant or device may be customized to the patient's needs. In order to market our Musculoskeletal Solutions products effectively, we must often maintain and provide surgeons and hospitals with consignment implant sets, back-up products and products of different sizes. For each surgery, fewer than all of the components of the set are used, and therefore certain portions of the set may be considered excess inventory since they are not likely to be used. One of our primary business goals is to focus on continual product innovation. Though we believe this provides us with a competitive advantage, it also increases the risk that our products will become excess or obsolete inventory prior to sale or prior to the end of their anticipated useful lives. When we introduce new products or next-generation products, we may be required to take charges for excess and obsolete inventory that have a significant impact on the value of our inventory or on our operating results.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired less the liabilities assumed. We acquired goodwill in connection with the various acquisitions completed. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a minimum on an annual basis. The fair value is estimated using an income and discounted cash flow approach. We performed our qualitative goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2018 and determined that fair value of our reporting units is substantially in excess of carrying value.\nIntangible assets consist of purchased in-process research and development ( IPR&D\u201d), developed technology, supplier networks, patents, customer relationships and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives ranging from one to seventeen years. Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If impairment is indicated, we measure the amount of the impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted future cash flow analysis.\nIPR&D has an indefinite life and is not amortized until completion and development of the project at which time the IPR&D becomes an amortizable asset. If the related project is not completed in a timely manner, we may have an impairment related to the IPR&D, calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value. During 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $3.5 million as a component of acquisition related costs.\nLong-Lived Assets. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived assets, which include property and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We assess impairment when the undiscounted future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset are less than its carrying value. If impairment is indicated, we measure the amount of the impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. We base our fair value methodology on quoted market prices, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, we estimate fair value based on prices of similar assets or other valuation techniques including present value techniques.\nIncome Taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which such items are expected to be received or settled. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. We establish a valuation allowance to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWhile we believe that our tax positions are fully supportable, there is a risk that certain positions could be challenged successfully. In these instances, we look to establish reserves. If we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that has likelihood greater than 50% of being realized upon settlement. We presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. We regularly monitor our tax positions, tax assets and tax liabilities. We reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit when (i) a tax audit is completed, (ii) applicable tax law, including a tax case or legislative guidance, changes or (iii) the statute of limitations expires. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves.\nLegal Proceedings. We are involved in a number of legal actions involving both product liability and intellectual property disputes. The outcomes of these legal actions are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the claimants seek damages as well as other relief, including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the lawsuit, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost sales. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible, but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded. While it is not possible to predict the outcome for these matters, we believe it is possible that costs associated with them could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings, financial position or cash flows.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense. We measure the cost for employee and non-employee awards at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. For employee awards, we amortize the expense, which is the fair value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest, over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award). We record the awards issued to non-employees at their fair value as determined in accordance with authoritative guidance, and we periodically revalue the awards as they vest, recognizing the expense over the requisite service period. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Our determination of the fair value is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.\nAs we became a publicly traded entity in 2012, historic volatility for our common stock is insufficient to estimate expected volatility. As a result, we estimate volatility based on a consistently defined peer group of public companies that we believe collectively provides a reasonable basis for estimating volatility. We intend to continue to use the consistently defined group of publicly traded peer companies to determine volatility in the future until sufficient information regarding volatility of the price of our shares of Class A common stock becomes available or the selected companies are no longer suitable for this purpose.\nWe also do not have sufficient history of stock option exercises as a public company available that is indicative of future exercise and post-vesting behavior to estimate the expected term after our initial public offering ( IPO\u201d). As a result, we use the simplified method of estimating the expected term, under which the expected term is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the contractual end of the term. We base the risk-free interest rate on observed interest rates of U.S. Treasury securities equivalent to the expected terms of the stock options. We estimate our pre-vesting forfeiture rate based on our historical experience. Our dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of no dividend payouts.\nWe estimate the weighted-average fair value of the options granted using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the\ncalculation of expected term and fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, among other inputs.\nTo the extent that further evidence regarding these variables is available and provides estimates that we believe are more indicative of actual trends, we may refine or change our approach to deriving these input estimates. Any such changes could materially affect the stock-based compensation expense we record in the future.\nWe expect to continue to grant stock options in the future, and to the extent that we do, our actual stock-based compensation expense recognized may increase.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nSales\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our sales by geography expressed as dollar amounts and the changes in sales between the specified periods expressed in dollar amounts and as percentages:\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>593,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>529,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>119,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>712,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>635,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the United States, the increase in sales of $64.0 million was due primarily to increased spine product sales due to penetration in existing territories, INR product sales, and associated implant and robotic instrument sales.\nInternationally, the increase in sales of $13.0 million was due primarily to increased sales in Japan and other existing countries as well as sales of INR product and associated robotic instrument sales.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 13. Income Taxes.\u201d\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures. For example, non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, which represents net income before interest income, net and other non-operating expenses, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, provision for litigation, acquisition related costs/licensing and prior period adjustment excluding depreciation, is useful as an additional measure of operating performance, and particularly as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period, as it is reflective of changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and other factors that affect operating performance, and it removes the effect of our capital structure, asset base, income taxes and interest income and expense. Our management also uses non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections. Provision for litigation represents costs incurred for litigation settlements or unfavorable verdicts when the loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, or in the case of a favorable settlement, when income is realized. Acquisition related costs/licensing represents the change in fair value of business-acquisition-related contingent consideration; costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses, including but not limited to costs to exit or convert contractual obligations, severance, and information system conversion; and specific costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process such as banker fees, legal fees, and other acquisition related professional fees, as well as one-time licensing fees. Prior period adjustment excluding depreciation represents the cumulative impact of prior year adjustments primarily related to a decrease in scrap adjustments of instruments and cases, none of which were individually material to the related year's financial position or results of operations.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net\n</td> <td>(13,278\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,608\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,057\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>32,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>41,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>38,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>216,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>205,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>21,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for litigation\n</td> <td>5,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related costs/licensing\n</td> <td>4,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain from sale of assets\n</td> <td>(3,593\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior period adjustment, excluding depreciation\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,697\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income as a percentage of sales\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\n * Included in this amount for the year ended December 31, 2016 is $5.5 million related to depreciation amounts recognized in the current year related to the prior period adjustment.

Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies; (b) Basis of Presentation.\u201d\nIn addition, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and for other comparative periods, we are presenting non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share, which represents net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the provision for litigation, amortization of intangibles, acquisition related costs/licensing, prior period adjustment and the tax effects of all of the foregoing adjustments. The tax effect adjustment represents the tax effect of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments excluded from non-GAAP net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is calculated based on the consolidated effective tax rate on a GAAP basis, applied to the non-GAAP adjustments, unless the underlying item has a materially different tax treatment, in which case the estimated tax rate applicable to the adjustment is used. At December 31, 2017, we calculated the tax effect of adjusting items utilizing our effective tax rate prior to the one-time Tax Reform Act adjustment. The effective tax rate applied was 30.3%.\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures are also useful indicators of our operating performance, and particularly as additional measures of comparative operating performance from period to period as they remove the effects of litigation, amortization of intangibles, acquisition related costs/licensing, and the tax effects of all of the foregoing adjustments, which we believe are not reflective of underlying business trends.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP net income for the periods

We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities, whereby our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. Excess operating cash is primarily used to fund acquisitions to advance the strategic growth of the Company, as well as continue our cash management program to generate returns on our cash and cash equivalents through investing in marketable securities, which include municipal bonds, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, securities of government, federal agency, and other sovereign obligations and asset-backed securities. Our overall cash position reflects our strong business results and a cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity, economic factors and tax considerations. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for further discussion of cash flow results.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due primarily to increased operational cash flows in 2018 related to timing of spending and cash receipts.\nThe decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to the timing of collection and billing of trade accounts receivable, which was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due primarily to higher investment in marketable securities and increased purchases of property and equipment, which was partially offset by the cash received from collection of the note receivable.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to higher investment in marketable securities and increased purchases of property and equipment, which was partially offset by the decrease in cash used for the acquisition of businesses.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\nThe increase in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due primarily to higher proceeds from exercises of stock options, which was partially offset by payments for business acquisition liabilities.\nThe increase in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to proceeds from exercises of stock options, which was partially offset by payments for business acquisition liabilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table highlights certain information related to our liquidity and capital resources:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term marketable securities\n</td> <td>199,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>254,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term marketable securities\n</td> <td>263,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>602,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>429,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities increased $173.0 million, primarily as a result of our cash provided by operating activities and increased investment in marketable securities. Our investment in marketable securities includes municipal bonds, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, U.S. treasuries, securities of government, federal agency, and other sovereign obligations and asset-backed securities, and are classified as available-for-sale as of December 31, 2018.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company identified and recorded an adjustment to its December 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet to correct the presentation of $65.8 million of its Variable Rate Demand Notes ( VRDNs\u201d) as short-term marketable securities instead of cash and cash equivalents (see Part II; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 1. Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d)\nOn June 13, 2017, we acquired the international operations and distribution channel of KB Medical SA for $31.5 million in cash, subject to certain closing adjustments (see Part II; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 2. Acquisitions.\u201d)\nIn May 2011, we entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank related to a revolving credit facility that provides for borrowings up to $50.0 million. In June 2018, we amended the credit agreement to increase the revolving credit facility amount from $50.0 million to $125.0 million. At our request, and with the approval of the bank, the amount of borrowings available under the revolving credit facility can be increased to $150.0 million. The revolving credit facility includes up to a $25.0 million sub-limit for letters of credit. As amended to date, the revolving credit facility expires in May 2019. Cash advances bear interest at our option either at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the daily LIBOR in effect for a one-month period plus 0.75%, or a fixed rate for a one- or three-month period equal to LIBOR plus 0.75%. The credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility also subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including the requirement to maintain maximum consolidated leverage. The covenants also include limitations on our ability to repurchase shares, to pay cash dividends or to enter into a sale transaction. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the credit agreement, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and available borrowings were $125.0 million. We may terminate the credit agreement at any time on ten days' notice without premium or penalty.\nIn addition to our existing cash and marketable securities balances, our principal sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities and our revolving credit facility, which was fully available as of December 31, 2018. We believe these sources will provide sufficient liquidity for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Our principal liquidity requirements are to meet our working capital, research and development, including clinical trials, and capital expenditure needs, principally for our surgical sets required to maintain and expand our business and potential future business or intellectual property acquisitions. We expect to continue to make investments in surgical sets as we launch new products, increase the size of our U.S. sales force, and expand into international markets. We may, however, require additional liquidity as we continue to execute our business strategy. Our liquidity may be negatively impacted as a result of a decline in sales of our products, including declines due to changes in our customers' ability to obtain third-party coverage and reimbursement for procedures that use our products, increased pricing pressures resulting from intensifying competition, cost increases and slower product development cycles resulting from a changing regulatory environment; and unfavorable results from litigation which will affect our cash flow. We anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the incurrence of other indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of liquidity. The sale of additional equity may result in dilution to our stockholders. There is no assurance that we will be able to secure such additional funding on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018.
