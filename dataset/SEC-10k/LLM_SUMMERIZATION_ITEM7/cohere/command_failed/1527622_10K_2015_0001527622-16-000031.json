Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe, and our significant equity method investees, own gathering systems, transportation pipelines, crude oil transport trucks, storage facilities and terminals in Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wyoming.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we made the decision to disaggregate certain activities and functions within the Partnership to provide additional granularity, both internally and externally, to our operating results. As such, the prior period results have been recast to reflect the resulting reportable segments.\nOur segments are organized by our key revenue generating activities:\nTransportation\nWe charge capacity or volume based fees to transport crude oil by pipeline and by truck. In addition, we generate the equivalent of a transportation fee by buying crude oil at one location and selling it back to the same counterparty at a different location for a fixed margin.\nFacilities\nWe charge capacity or volume based fees for crude oil storage and terminal services at our facilities in Cushing, along the Kansas and Oklahoma pipeline system and at Platteville, Colorado. We also charge capacity or volume based fees to use our truck unloading facility at Platteville.\nSupply and Logistics\nWe purchase crude oil for our own account from producers, aggregators and traders and sell crude oil, including crude oil blends, to traders and refiners.\nWe mitigate the commodity price exposure of our crude oil marketing operations by limiting our net open positions through (i) the concurrent purchase and sale of like quantities of crude oil to create back-to-back\u201d transactions intended to lock in positive margins based on the timing, location or quality of the crude oil purchased and delivered or (ii) derivative contracts. All of our marketing activities are subject to our Comprehensive Risk Management Policy, which establishes limits to manage risk and mitigate financial exposure.\nMore specifically, we use futures and swap contracts to manage our exposure to market changes in commodity prices to protect our Adjusted gross margin on our purchased crude oil. As we purchase crude oil from suppliers, we may establish either a fixed or a variable margin with future sales by:\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>selling a like quantity of crude oil for future physical delivery to create an effective back-to-back transaction; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>entering into futures and swaps contracts on the NYMEX or over-the-counter markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral Trends and Outlook\nThe price of crude oil has historically been volatile. For example, from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015, the NYMEX prompt month settle price ranged from a high of $107.26 per barrel to a low of $34.73 per barrel. For the year 2015, the range narrowed to a high of $61.43 per barrel to a low of $34.73 per barrel. Substantial declines in crude oil prices, particularly prolonged declines, can have negative effects on crude oil producers including:\n\u2022reduced revenue, operating income and cash flows;\n\u2022reduced volume of crude oil that can be produced economically;\n\u2022delayed or postponed capital projects; and/or\n\u2022limited access to or increased cost of capital, such as equity and long-term debt.\nThe substantial decline in crude oil prices since mid-2014 and continuing throughout 2015 have had these effects on a number of companies in the oil industry, including our customers. While we do not have significant direct exposure to crude oil\nprices, we are exposed to a reduction in volumes to be transported, stored and marketed as a result of lower prices. We experienced such reductions in 2015 and expect them to continue in 2016.\nIn response to these economic conditions, we are increasing our focus on controlling expenses, reviewing the economics of capital projects, increasing control over headcount and relocating our Oklahoma City office to Tulsa.\nInterest Rates\nThe credit markets have experienced very low interest rates recently. As the overall economy strengthens, it is likely that monetary policy will tighten, resulting in higher interest rates to counter possible inflation. If this occurs, interest rates on floating rate credit facilities and future offerings in the debt capital markets could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly.\nIn addition, there is a financing cost for the storage capacity used to carry the cost of the inventory while it is stored in the facility. That financing cost is impacted by the cost of capital or interest rate incurred by the storage user as well as the commodity cost of the crude oil in inventory. The higher the financing cost, the lower the margin that will remain from the price spread that was intended to be captured. Accordingly, a significant increase in interest rates could impact the demand for storage capacity independent of other market fundamentals.\nOur implied distribution yield is a product of our unit price and the level of our cash distributions. It is determined by dividing our annual cash distribution by our common unit price. The distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank related yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our common units, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price. In addition, increases in yield may hinder our ability to issue additional equity to make acquisitions, reduce debt or to fund other activities or working capital needs.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance. We view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and review these measurements on at least a monthly basis for consistency and trend analysis. These metrics include financial measures, including Adjusted gross margin, operating expenses and Adjusted EBITDA, and operating data, including contracted storage capacity and transportation, marketing and unloading volumes.\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nWe view Adjusted gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations, as well as our operating performance as compared to that of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis, capital structure or the impact of fluctuating commodity prices. We define Adjusted gross margin as total revenues minus cost of products sold and unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives. Adjusted gross margin allows us to make a meaningful comparison of the results across different commodity price environments because it measures the spread between the product sales price and cost of products sold. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d.\nOperating Expenses\nOur management seeks to maximize the profitability of our operations, in part, by minimizing operating expenses. These expenses are comprised of salary and wage expense, utility costs, insurance premiums, taxes and other operating costs, some of which are independent of the volumes we handle.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, earnings from equity method investments and any other non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus cash distributions from equity method investments. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance and liquidity measure to assess:\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our operating performance as compared to that of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis, capital structure or the impact of fluctuating commodity prices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our partners;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Contracted Storage Capacity and Transportation, Marketing and Unloading Volumes\nIn our Cushing storage operations, we charge our customers a fee for storage capacity provided, regardless of actual usage. On our Kansas and Oklahoma system, in our Bakken Shale operations and through our trucking fleet operations, we provide transportation services on a fee basis or pursuant to fixed-margin transactions, but in either case, the Adjusted gross margin we generate is dependent on the volume of crude oil transported (if on a fee basis) or purchased and sold (if pursuant to a fixed-margin transaction). We refer to these volumes, in the aggregate, as transportation volumes. Similarly, on our Kansas and Oklahoma system, and through our Bakken Shale operations, we conduct marketing activities involving the purchase and sale of crude oil or related derivative contracts. We refer to the crude oil volumes purchased and sold in our marketing operations as Supply and Logistics volumes. Finally, at our Platteville truck unloading facility, we charge our customers a fee based on the volumes unloaded. We refer to these as unloading volumes.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe define Adjusted gross margin as total revenues minus cost of products sold and unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, earnings from equity method investments, and any other non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus cash distributions from equity method investments.\nAdjusted gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations.\nOperating income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted gross margin, and net income (loss) and cash provided by (used in) operating activities are the GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider Adjusted gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nManagement compensates for the limitation of Adjusted gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between Adjusted gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA, on the one hand, and operating income (loss), net income (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, on the other hand, and incorporating this knowledge into its decision-making processes. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results.\nThe following tables present reconciliations of: (i) Adjusted gross margin to operating income, and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for each of the periods indicated.

Revenues from fee-based services are included in service revenue and revenues from fixed-margin are included in product revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income. As there is no cost of sales or derivative activity associated with our Transportation revenue, Adjusted gross margin is equivalent to revenue for this segment.\n2015 versus 2014\nRevenues\nPipeline transportation revenue includes both fee-based and fixed-margin activity. Pipeline transportation revenues increased to $32 million in 2015 from $29 million in 2014. The extension of the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline in early 2015 resulted in an additional $7 million due to higher volumes. Higher volumes on the Tampa pipeline resulted in an additional $1 million. These increases were partially offset with reductions in fixed-margin and other fee-based activity of $3 million and $2 million, respectively.\nExternal truck transportation revenues decreased to $50 million in 2015 from $56 million in 2014. The decrease was due to a higher concentration of shorter haul activity despite higher volumes.\nIntersegment truck transportation revenues increased to $15 million in 2015 from $11 million in 2014. The increase was due to additional barrels purchased directly from the producer and hauled for our Supply and Logistics segment.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2015 to $74 million from $71 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to additional employment and insurance/taxes of $1 million and $1 million, respectively, resulting from a full year of operations from the crude oil trucking assets acquired in June 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased in 2015 to $9 million from $8 million in 2014, due primarily to a $2 million increase in overhead allocation from SemGroup to our trucking activity, partially offset by a $1 million reduction in\nemployment expense at our crude oil trucking division. This reduction was primarily due to lower incentive compensation and a restructuring of administrative positions.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased in 2015 to $36 million from $34 million in 2014. Approximately $2 million of the increase in depreciation expense is due to the 2014 revision of the estimated useful life relating to a section of the Kansas and Oklahoma pipeline system. An additional $5 million of the depreciation increase is due to project completions and the crude oil trucking fleet acquisition in 2014. Amortization decreased in 2015 to $1 million from $6 million in 2014. The decrease was due to contracts acquired as part of the crude oil trucking fleet acquisition in 2013 becoming fully amortized in 2014.\nLoss on Disposal or Impairment, net\nIn 2015, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $9.5 million associated with our crude oil trucking operations which reduced the carrying value of goodwill to $26.6 million.\nWe used a discounted cash flow model, supplemented by a market approach to perform the goodwill impairment analysis. Key assumptions in the analysis include the use of an appropriate discount rate, volume and rate forecasts and estimates of operating costs.\nWhen considering operating performance projections, we included industry economic conditions, current crude oil prices and the forward price curve. Due to the imprecise nature of our projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do differ from our estimates. If the assumptions used in our projections prove to be inaccurate, we could incur a future impairment charge.\nEarnings from Equity Method Investments\nEarnings from equity method investments increased in 2015 to $76 million from $57 million in 2014. The increase is due to our commissioning of White Cliffs' second line in August 2014 and our January 2015 acquisition of ownership interest in Glass Mountain. Earnings from White Cliffs increased by approximately $13 million and earnings from Glass Mountain increased by approximately $6 million in 2015 compared to 2014.\n2014 versus 2013\nRevenues\nPipeline transportation revenues increased to $29 million in 2014 from $21 million in 2013. The increase was due to capital expansion projects being placed in service near the end of 2013, including the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline. The Wattenberg Oil Trunkline and other fee-based activity contributed an additional $7 million and $1 million, respectively.\nExternal truck transportation revenues increased to $56 million in 2014 from $14 million in 2013. The increase was due to a full year of operations from the September 2013 crude oil trucking acquisition and a partial year of operations from the crude oil trucking assets acquired in June 2014.\nIntersegment truck transportation revenues began in late 2013. These revenues resulted from acquisitions of barrels purchased directly from the producer and hauled for our Supply and Logistics segment.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2014 to $71 million from $24 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to a full year of operations from the September 2013 crude oil trucking acquisition and a partial year of operations from the crude oil trucking assets acquired in June 2014. The increase included employment costs of $18 million, outside services from contract owner operators of $16 million, field expenses of $6 million, maintenance and repair of $2 million, insurance/taxes of $2 million, and other expense of $1 million. An additional $1 million and $1 million resulted from full year operations of the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline and the Tampa pipeline, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased in 2014 to $8 million from $5 million in 2013. The corporate overhead allocation from SemGroup increased $2 million as a result of higher corporate costs combined with a higher allocation rate attributable to Rose Rock. Employment costs increased $1 million primarily due to additional incentive compensation.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased in 2014 to $34 million from $18 million in 2013. Approximately $4 million of the depreciation increase is due to a revision of the estimated useful life relating to a 164-mile section of the Kansas and Oklahoma pipeline system. An additional $7 million of the depreciation increase is due to project completions and the crude oil trucking fleet acquisitions in 2013 and 2014. Amortization increased in 2014 to $6 million from $1 million in 2013 due to contracts acquired as part of the crude oil trucking fleet acquisitions in 2013 and 2014.\nEarnings from Equity Method Investments\nEarnings from equity method investments increased in 2014 to $57 million from $18 million in 2013. The increase in earnings is due to the acquisitions of additional interest in White Cliffs in December 2013 and June 2014.\nFacilities\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating\n</td> <td>8,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>3,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>5,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposal or impairment, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>18,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin in this segment is generated by providing fee-based services.

The increase was primarily due to additional unloading volumes at Platteville and additional pumpover activity at our storage facilities.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2015 to $9 million from $8 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to $1 million additional operating expenses from corporate headquarters and increased outside services.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense remained constant at $4 million in both 2015 and 2014.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased in 2015 to $6 million from $5 million in 2014. The increase is due to capital expenditure project completions.\n2014 versus 2013\nRevenue\nRevenues decreased in 2014 to $44 million from $47 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to reduced storage fees due to the conversion of 0.6 million barrels of storage capacity in Cushing for operational use.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2014 to $8 million from $7 million in 2013. The increase was due to $1 million of additional operations support expenses and increased employment related expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased in 2014 to $4 million from $3 million in 2013, primarily due to overhead allocations from SemGroup.\nGeneral\nIn every other category of expense, the amounts for the year ended 2014 are roughly equivalent to those for the year ended 2013.\nSupply and Logistics\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>716,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,169,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>685,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of products sold\n</td> <td>686,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,142,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>663,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating\n</td> <td>995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>662\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposal or impairment, net\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>688,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,144,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>670,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin in this segment is generated from marketing activities.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in the volume sold to 42.6 million barrels at an average sales price of $49 per barrel in 2015 from the volume sold of 19.1 million barrels at an average sales price of $95 per barrel in 2014.\nGross product revenue was reduced by $1.4 billion and $0.6 billion during 2015 and 2014, respectively, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 845-10-15, \"Nonmonetary Transactions\". ASC 845-10-15 requires that certain transactions -- those where inventory is purchased from a customer then resold to the same customer -- to be presented in the income statement on a net basis, resulting in a reduction of revenue and costs of products sold by the same amount.\nCost of Products Sold\nCosts of products sold decreased in 2015 to $687 million (including $15 million intersegment transportation expense) from $1.1 billion in 2014 (including $11 million intersegment transportation expense). The decrease was primarily due to reductions of $1.4 billion and $0.6 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15. There was an increase in the barrels sold, as described above, combined with a decrease in the average per barrel cost of crude oil to $48 in 2015 from $94 in 2014.\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin increased in 2015 to $32 million from $26 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in marketing volumes of 23.5 million barrels, partially offset by a lower spread between the acquisition and sale price for volumes of crude oil sold, as the excess of our average sales price per barrel over our average acquisition cost per barrel decreased to approximately $0.75 for 2015, from approximately $1.34 for 2014. The increase in volume was primarily due to crude oil blending and transactions related to contango market conditions.\nGeneral\nIn every other category of expense, the amounts for the year ended 2015 are roughly equivalent to those for the year ended 2014.\n2014 versus 2013\nRevenue\nGross product revenue increased in 2014 to $1.8 billion from $1.1 billion in 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the volume sold to 19.1 million barrels at an average sales price of $95 per barrel in 2014 from the volume sold of 11.0 million barrels, at an average sales price of $101 per barrel in 2013.\nGross product revenue was reduced by $645 million and $426 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15.\nCosts of Products Sold\nCosts of products sold increased in 2014 to $1.1 billion (including $11 million intersegment transportation expense) from $0.7 billion in 2013. Costs of products sold increased due to the increase in the barrels sold, as described above, combined with a decrease in the average cost per barrel of crude oil to $94 in 2014 from $99 in 2013. Costs of product sold reflected reductions of $645 million and $426 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15.\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nSupply and Logistics Adjusted gross margin increased in 2014 to $26 million from $21 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in marketing volumes of 8.1 million barrels, partially offset by a lower spread between the acquisition and sale price for volumes of crude oil sold, as the excess of our average sales price per barrel over our average acquisition cost per barrel decreased to approximately $1.34 for 2014, from approximately $1.87 for 2013. The increase in volume was primarily due to crude oil blending.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense decreased in 2014 to $1 million from $5 million in 2013. The decrease is due to the relocation of employees and certain trucking related activities from our North Dakota operations, which were included in our Supply and Logistics segment, to our Rose Rock Field Services operations, which are included in our Transportation segment.\nGeneral\nIn every other category of expense, the amounts for the year ended 2014 are roughly equivalent to those for the year ended 2013.\nCorporate and Other\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,021\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(225\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of products sold\n</td> <td>(15,021\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(225\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>7,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>388\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss (gain) on disposal or impairment, net\n</td> <td>639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>(6,349\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,855\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,672\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,985\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,871\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate and Other is not a reportable segment and includes corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments and intersegment eliminations.

In addition, we are subject to conditions in the debt and equity markets for debt securities and limited partner units. There can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets in the future. If we would be unable or unwilling to access those markets, we could be required to restrict future expansion capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions.\nWe believe our cash from operations and our remaining borrowing capacity allow us to manage our day-to-day cash requirements, distribute the minimum quarterly distribution on all of our outstanding units and meet our capital expenditure commitments for the coming year.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our changes in cash and cash equivalents for the years presented (in thousands): Table 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(313,812\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(239,752\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(254,612\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>236,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>5,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,812\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n</td> <td>3,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe components of operating cash flows can be summarized as follows (in thousands):\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash expenses, net\n</td> <td>61,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net\n</td> <td>(28,044\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe experienced operating cash inflows of $82.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating cash flows were primarily driven by net income of $49.7 million, which included $61.2 million in non-cash expenses. The primary non-cash expenses were $42.0 million of depreciation and amortization and $10.3 million of loss on disposal or impairment, net principally the impairment of goodwill of our Transportation segment. Operating cash flows included $76.4 million of cash distributions which represent returns on our investments in White Cliffs and Glass Mountain. Net changes in operating assets\nand liabilities decreased operating cash flows by $28.0 million. The primary change was an increase in inventories of $35.0 million due to 1.1 million barrels of additional inventory. This is partially due to a strategic build to capture margins due to forward market crude oil prices being higher than spot market prices. Accounts payable, including payable to affiliates, and accrued liabilities increased by $15.8 million and accounts receivable, including receivable from affiliates, increased by $6.4 million. The impact to accounts receivable and accounts payable are subject to the timing of inventory purchases and sales and the timing of their related payments and collections.\nWe experienced operating cash inflows of $111.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating cash flows were primarily driven by net income of $62.9 million, which included $46.9 million of non-cash expenses. The primary non-cash expense was $40.0 million of depreciation and amortization. Operating cash flows included $57.4 million of cash distributions which represent returns on our investment in White Cliffs. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities had minimal impact on cash flow as changes in receivables and inventory were offset by changes in payables and accrued liabilities.\nWe experienced operating cash inflows of $73.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2013. Net income of $37.5 million included $23.7 million of non-cash expenses. The primary non-cash expense was $23.7 million of depreciation and amortization. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows by $12.1 million. The primary changes were an increase to accounts payable, including payable to affiliates, and accrued liabilities of $61.8 million and an increase in accounts receivable, including receivable from affiliates, of $43.0 million. The increases to accounts receivable, including receivable from affiliates, and accounts payable, including payable to affiliates, and accrued liabilities are primarily due to our ability to capture value related to market conditions and demand around our Kansas and Oklahoma system and Bakken Shale operations through marketing and buy/sell transactions and increased activity related to our acquisition of Barcas Field Services, LLC (\"Barcas\"). The impact to accounts receivable and accounts payable is subject to the timing of inventory purchases and sales and the timing of their related payments and collections. The increases in receivable from and payable to affiliates primarily relate to business acquisitions of SemGroup's equity method investee, NGL Energy, through which certain customers and suppliers became related parties.\nInvesting Activities\nWe experienced cash outflows from investing activities of $313.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 driven by $205.1 million for acquisitions, $86.3 million of capital expenditures and $46.7 million of contributions to equity method investments, partially offset by cash inflows of $24.1 million from distributions from equity investees in excess of equity in earnings. Acquisitions represent the historical cost of Wattenberg Oil Trunkline and a 50% interest in Glass Mountain purchased from SemGroup. Cash consideration in excess of historical cost is reported as a financing activity in the cash flow statement. Capital expenditures related to the Wattenberg Pipeline extension and other projects and contributions to equity method investments primarily related to capital calls to fund the expansion of the White Cliffs Pipeline.\nWe experienced cash outflows from investing activities of $239.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to the acquisition of crude oil trucking assets and the remaining interest in SCPL for an aggregate of $134.0 million, contributions of $54.9 million to White Cliffs related to expansion of the pipeline and capital expenditures of $61.3 million to expand our existing asset base, including our Platteville expansion, Tampa pipeline lateral and Wattenberg Oil Trunkline.\nWe experienced cash outflows from investing activities of $254.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 related to the acquisitions of Barcas and SCPL of $171.3 million, capital expenditures of $51.6 million, and contributions to equity method investment of $31.8 million, which related to capital calls to fund the White Cliffs Pipeline expansion.\nFinancing Activities\nWe experienced net cash inflows from financing activities of $236.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which were driven primarily by the issuance of $344.2 million of senior unsecured notes due 2023, net of a $5.8 million discount, and $89.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of common limited partner units, reduced by net payments of $32.0 million on our revolving credit facility ($342.0 million of borrowings less $374.0 million in principal payments), $112.9 million of cash distributions to partners and $46.3 million cash consideration in excess of historical cost of the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline and a 50% interest in Glass Mountain. Proceeds from the issuance of common limited partner units were primarily used to fund the acquisition of the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline and a 50% interest in Glass Mountain from SemGroup. Proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes due 2023 were used to pay amounts owed under our revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes.\nWe experienced net cash inflows from financing activities of $116.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 driven by $187.0 million of net borrowings on debt ($844.4 million of borrowings, net of $657.4 million of principal payments), $62.3 million of cash distributions to partners and $21.5 million of contributions from general partner. Borrowings included the issuance of $400 million of senior unsecured notes. Borrowings were used primarily to fund acquisitions. Cash\nflows from financing activities also reflect a $24.4 million cash distribution to SemGroup related to the SemCrude Pipeline acquisition. As this transaction was between entities under common control, Rose Rock recorded the acquired net assets at SemGroup's historical cost and the excess of the purchase price over the historical value was treated as an equity transaction. Contributions from and distributions to noncontrolling interests represent activity related to SemGroup's retained interest in SemCrude Pipeline prior to our acquisition of the remaining interest. Contributions from general partner of $21.5 million reflect funding for the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline prior to its acquisition from SemGroup in a common control transaction for which historical financial results have been recast.\nWe experienced net cash inflows from financing activities of $196.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 driven by $240.5 million of net borrowings on debt ($558.0 million of borrowings, net of $317.5 million of principal payments), $210.2 million of proceeds from issuance of common limited partner units, net of offering costs, $38.1 million of cash distributions to partners and $28.6 million of contributions from general partner. Borrowings were used primarily to fund acquisitions. Proceeds from issuances of common limited partner units were used to repay debt and fund acquisitions. Cash flows from financing activities also reflect a $240.6 million cash distribution to SemGroup related to the SemCrude Pipeline acquisition. As these transactions were between entities under common control, Rose Rock recorded the acquired net assets at SemGroup's historical cost and the excess of the purchase price over the historical value was treated as an equity transaction. Contributions from general partner of $28.6 million reflect funding for the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline prior to its acquisition from SemGroup in a common control transaction for which historical financial results have been recast.\nLong-term debt\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $400 million of senior unsecured notes outstanding, which become due in 2022, and $350 million of senior unsecured notes outstanding, which become due in 2023. At December 31, 2015, the borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility was $549.7 million, which includes the impact of $35.3 million of outstanding letters of credit which reduce the capacity available for borrowings. At December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility.\nThe credit agreement contains certain financial performance covenants. For any test period, our Leverage Ratio cannot be in excess of 5.50:1.00; our Senior Secured Leverage Ratio cannot be in excess of 3.50:1.00; and our Interest Coverage Ratio cannot be less than 2.50:1.00. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with our financial performance covenants.\nSee Note 8 of our accompanying financial statements for additional information regarding long-term debt.\nShelf Registration Statement\nWe have an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC that, subject to market conditions and effectiveness at the time of use, allows us to issue up to an aggregate of $500 million of debt or equity securities. In August 2013, we used this shelf registration statement to sell 4.75 million common units representing limited partner interests for proceeds of $152.5 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of $6.4 million. On February 13, 2015, we issued and sold 2.3 million common units representing limited partner interests for net proceeds of $89.1 million under this shelf. Proceeds were used in connection with our acquisition of the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline and a 50% interest in Glass Mountain from SemGroup. This shelf registration statement expires in May 2016.\nWe also have an effective shelf registration statement for the offer and sale, from time to time, of common units representing limited partner interests in us having an aggregate offering price of up to $150 million. We are able to make sales over a period of time and, from time to time, in transactions at prices which are market prices prevailing at the time of sale, prices related to market price or at negotiated prices. Such sales may be made pursuant to a sales agency financing agreement between us and certain underwriters or agents who may act as sales agents or purchase for their own accounts as principals. To date, no such sales have been made.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities and is a measure of our ability to pay our liabilities as they become due. Our working capital was $36.6 million and $9.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe increase in working capital at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 is primarily due to an additional 1.1 million barrels of crude oil inventory which is partially related to a strategic build to capture margins due to forward market crude oil prices being higher than spot market prices.\nCapital Requirements\nThe midstream energy business can be capital intensive, requiring significant investment for the maintenance of existing assets or acquisition or development of new systems and facilities. We categorize our capital expenditures as either:\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expansion related capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long-term; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintenance capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures (including expenditures for the addition or improvement to, or the replacement of, our capital assets or for the acquisition of existing, or the construction or development of new capital assets) made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we invested cash of $86.3 million on capital projects, $46.7 million in contributions to our equity investees related to expansion projects and $205.1 million for acquisitions, exclusive of amounts in excess of historical cost on common control acquisitions and equity issued as consideration. Projected capital expenditures for 2016 include $25 million for expansion projects, including capital contributions to equity method investees to fund growth projects, and $10 million in maintenance projects.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to make significant expansion capital expenditures in the future. Consequently, our ability to develop and maintain sources of funds to meet our capital requirements is critical to our ability to meet our growth objectives. We expect that our future expansion capital expenditures will be funded by cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of debt and equity securities.\nDistributions\nThe following table sets forth cash distributions paid in 2014, 2015 and 2016:\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Record Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Distribution Per Unit\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 4, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 14, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.4650\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 5, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 15, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.4950\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 4, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 14, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.5350\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 4, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 14, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.5750\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 3, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 13, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.6200\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 5, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 15, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.6350\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 4, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 14, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.6500\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 3, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 13, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.6600\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 2, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 12, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.6600\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Risk\nWe are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. We examine the creditworthiness of third-party customers to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of credit, prepayments or guarantees.\nCustomer Concentration\nShell Trading (US) Company and BP Oil Supply Company, each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, at approximately 54% and 16%, respectively. Shell Trading (US) Company and BP Oil Supply Company, each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, at approximately 60% and 15%, respectively. Shell Trading (US) Company and Tesoro Refining and Marketing Co., each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013, at approximately 31% and 15%, respectively. Although we have contracts with customers of varying duration, if one or more of our major customers were to default on their contract or if we were to be unable to renew our contract with one or more of these customers on favorable\nterms, we might not be able to replace any of these customers in a timely fashion, on favorable terms or at all. In any of these situations, our revenues and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders may be adversely affected. We expect our exposure to risk of non-payment or non-performance to continue as long as we remain substantially dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of business we enter into various contractual obligations for varying terms and amounts. The following table includes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015, and our best estimate of the period in which the obligations will be settled:\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>750,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (1)\n</td> <td>43,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>1,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments (2)\n</td> <td>563,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Throughput commitment (3)\n</td> <td>12,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditure project (4)\n</td> <td>2,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>623,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>873,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Assumes interest rates, fee rates and letters of credit and loans outstanding are as of December 31, 2015, and remain constant thereafter until maturity except for required principal payments.

Our liabilities with respect to these purchase obligations are recorded as accounts payable on our balance sheet in the month the crude oil is purchased. Generally, these letters of credit are issued for 50- to 70-day periods (with a maximum of a 364-day period) and are terminated upon completion of each transaction. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $78.2 million and $85.1 million, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Item 303 of Regulation S-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects and legal and regulatory challenges. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on\nvarying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed.\nOn an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable. Actual results may differ substantially from our estimates. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 of our audited consolidated financial statements shown beginning on page of this Form 10-K. We identify our critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe follow the guidance of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d to account for derivative instruments. ASC 815 requires us to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet, and recognize changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings. In certain cases, we may apply hedge accounting to our derivative instruments. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are: (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure; (ii) whether the overall risk is being reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between the fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments accounted for as hedges are either recognized in earnings, as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged item, or deferred and recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur.\nCertain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered to be a normal purchase normal sale ( NPNS\u201d). The availability of this exception is based on the assumption that we have the ability, and intent, to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. These assumptions are based on internal forecasts of sales and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives that are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting treatment and are accounted for under accrual accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with immediate recognition through earnings.\nWe routinely enter into agreements to purchase and sell petroleum products at specified future dates. We establish a margin for these purchases by entering into various types of physical and financial sales and exchange transactions through which we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchases on the one hand and sales and future delivery obligations on the other. We account for these commitments as normal purchases and sales, and therefore we do not record assets or liabilities related to these agreements until the product is purchased or sold.\nOur results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for petroleum products. We manage this exposure to commodity price risk, in part, by entering into various commodity derivatives. We seek to manage the price risk associated with our marketing operations by limiting our net open positions through (i) the concurrent purchase and sale of like quantities of crude oil to create back-to-back transactions that are intended to lock in positive margins based on the timing, location or quality of the crude oil purchased and delivered or (ii) derivative contracts. Our storage and transportation assets also can be used to mitigate location and time basis risk. All marketing activities are subject to our Comprehensive Risk Management Policy, which establishes limits in order to manage risk and mitigate financial exposure.\nOur commodity derivatives are comprised of crude oil forward contracts and futures contracts. These are defined as follows:\nForward contracts - Over the counter contracts to buy or sell a commodity at an agreed upon future date. The buyer and seller agree on specific terms (price, quantity, delivery period, and location) and conditions at the inception of the contract.\nFutures contracts - Exchange traded contracts to buy or sell a commodity. These contracts are standardized by the exchange in terms of quality, quantity, delivery period and location for each commodity.\nWe record certain commodity derivative assets and liabilities at fair value at each balance sheet date. Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of\nthe significance of a particular input to the measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value levels. We have not designated any of our commodity derivatives as hedges.\nAdditional discussion of the accounting for derivative instruments at fair value is included in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K.\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment,\u201d we evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators are:\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>significant adverse change in the manner an asset is used or its physical condition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>adverse business climate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>change in our intent about an asset from an intent to hold such asset through the end of its estimated useful life to a greater than fifty percent likelihood that such asset will be disposed of before then.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows. However, actual future market prices and costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates and the impact of such variations could be material.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe apply ASC 805, Business Combinations,\u201d and ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,\u201d to account for goodwill and intangible assets. In accordance with these standards, we amortize all finite lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted average useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. However, goodwill and all intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We test for impairment at the reporting unit level using three valuation approaches: first, the income approach which measures the value of an asset by the present value of its future economic benefit; second, the market approach which measures the value of an asset through the analysis of recent sales or offerings of comparable properties; and third, the cost approach which measures the value of an asset by the cost to reconstruct or replace it with another of like utility.\nEstimation of future economic benefit requires management to make assumptions about numerous variables including selling prices, costs, the level of activity and appropriate discount rates. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, our goodwill or intangible assets will be impaired at that time.\nContingencies\nWe record a loss contingency when management determines that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. Gain contingencies are not recorded.\nWhile we have disclosed a number of contingencies (as described in Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements, which are included in this Form 10-K beginning on page), we have not accrued for any contingent loss at December 31, 2015.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements, which are included

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe, and our significant equity method investees, own gathering systems, transportation pipelines, crude oil transport trucks, storage facilities and terminals in Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wyoming.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we made the decision to disaggregate certain activities and functions within the Partnership to provide additional granularity, both internally and externally, to our operating results. As such, the prior period results have been recast to reflect the resulting reportable segments.\nOur segments are organized by our key revenue generating activities:\nTransportation\nWe charge capacity or volume based fees to transport crude oil by pipeline and by truck. In addition, we generate the equivalent of a transportation fee by buying crude oil at one location and selling it back to the same counterparty at a different location for a fixed margin.\nFacilities\nWe charge capacity or volume based fees for crude oil storage and terminal services at our facilities in Cushing, along the Kansas and Oklahoma pipeline system and at Platteville, Colorado. We also charge capacity or volume based fees to use our truck unloading facility at Platteville.\nSupply and Logistics\nWe purchase crude oil for our own account from producers, aggregators and traders and sell crude oil, including crude oil blends, to traders and refiners.\nWe mitigate the commodity price exposure of our crude oil marketing operations by limiting our net open positions through (i) the concurrent purchase and sale of like quantities of crude oil to create back-to-back\u201d transactions intended to lock in positive margins based on the timing, location or quality of the crude oil purchased and delivered or (ii) derivative contracts. All of our marketing activities are subject to our Comprehensive Risk Management Policy, which establishes limits to manage risk and mitigate financial exposure.\nMore specifically, we use futures and swap contracts to manage our exposure to market changes in commodity prices to protect our Adjusted gross margin on our purchased crude oil. As we purchase crude oil from suppliers, we may establish either a fixed or a variable margin with future sales by:\n \u2022 selling a like quantity of crude oil for future physical delivery to create an effective back-to-back transaction; or \n \u2022 entering into futures and swaps contracts on the NYMEX or over-the-counter markets. \nGeneral Trends and Outlook\nThe price of crude oil has historically been volatile. For example, from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015, the NYMEX prompt month settle price ranged from a high of $107.26 per barrel to a low of $34.73 per barrel. For the year 2015, the range narrowed to a high of $61.43 per barrel to a low of $34.73 per barrel. Substantial declines in crude oil prices, particularly prolonged declines, can have negative effects on crude oil producers including:\n\u2022reduced revenue, operating income and cash flows;\n\u2022reduced volume of crude oil that can be produced economically;\n\u2022delayed or postponed capital projects; and/or\n\u2022limited access to or increased cost of capital, such as equity and long-term debt.\nThe substantial decline in crude oil prices since mid-2014 and continuing throughout 2015 have had these effects on a number of companies in the oil industry, including our customers. While we do not have significant direct exposure to crude oil\nprices, we are exposed to a reduction in volumes to be transported, stored and marketed as a result of lower prices. We experienced such reductions in 2015 and expect them to continue in 2016.\nIn response to these economic conditions, we are increasing our focus on controlling expenses, reviewing the economics of capital projects, increasing control over headcount and relocating our Oklahoma City office to Tulsa.\nInterest Rates\nThe credit markets have experienced very low interest rates recently. As the overall economy strengthens, it is likely that monetary policy will tighten, resulting in higher interest rates to counter possible inflation. If this occurs, interest rates on floating rate credit facilities and future offerings in the debt capital markets could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly.\nIn addition, there is a financing cost for the storage capacity used to carry the cost of the inventory while it is stored in the facility. That financing cost is impacted by the cost of capital or interest rate incurred by the storage user as well as the commodity cost of the crude oil in inventory. The higher the financing cost, the lower the margin that will remain from the price spread that was intended to be captured. Accordingly, a significant increase in interest rates could impact the demand for storage capacity independent of other market fundamentals.\nOur implied distribution yield is a product of our unit price and the level of our cash distributions. It is determined by dividing our annual cash distribution by our common unit price. The distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank related yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our common units, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price. In addition, increases in yield may hinder our ability to issue additional equity to make acquisitions, reduce debt or to fund other activities or working capital needs.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance. We view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and review these measurements on at least a monthly basis for consistency and trend analysis. These metrics include financial measures, including Adjusted gross margin, operating expenses and Adjusted EBITDA, and operating data, including contracted storage capacity and transportation, marketing and unloading volumes.\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nWe view Adjusted gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations, as well as our operating performance as compared to that of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis, capital structure or the impact of fluctuating commodity prices. We define Adjusted gross margin as total revenues minus cost of products sold and unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives. Adjusted gross margin allows us to make a meaningful comparison of the results across different commodity price environments because it measures the spread between the product sales price and cost of products sold. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d.\nOperating Expenses\nOur management seeks to maximize the profitability of our operations, in part, by minimizing operating expenses. These expenses are comprised of salary and wage expense, utility costs, insurance premiums, taxes and other operating costs, some of which are independent of the volumes we handle.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, earnings from equity method investments and any other non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus cash distributions from equity method investments. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance and liquidity measure to assess:\n \u2022 our operating performance as compared to that of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis, capital structure or the impact of fluctuating commodity prices; \n \u2022 the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our partners; \n \u2022 our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and \n \u2022 the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.  Contracted Storage Capacity and Transportation, Marketing and Unloading Volumes\nIn our Cushing storage operations, we charge our customers a fee for storage capacity provided, regardless of actual usage. On our Kansas and Oklahoma system, in our Bakken Shale operations and through our trucking fleet operations, we provide transportation services on a fee basis or pursuant to fixed-margin transactions, but in either case, the Adjusted gross margin we generate is dependent on the volume of crude oil transported (if on a fee basis) or purchased and sold (if pursuant to a fixed-margin transaction). We refer to these volumes, in the aggregate, as transportation volumes. Similarly, on our Kansas and Oklahoma system, and through our Bakken Shale operations, we conduct marketing activities involving the purchase and sale of crude oil or related derivative contracts. We refer to the crude oil volumes purchased and sold in our marketing operations as Supply and Logistics volumes. Finally, at our Platteville truck unloading facility, we charge our customers a fee based on the volumes unloaded. We refer to these as unloading volumes.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe define Adjusted gross margin as total revenues minus cost of products sold and unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, earnings from equity method investments, and any other non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus cash distributions from equity method investments.\nAdjusted gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations.\nOperating income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted gross margin, and net income (loss) and cash provided by (used in) operating activities are the GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider Adjusted gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nManagement compensates for the limitation of Adjusted gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between Adjusted gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA, on the one hand, and operating income (loss), net income (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, on the other hand, and incorporating this knowledge into its decision-making processes. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results.\nThe following tables present reconciliations of: (i) Adjusted gross margin to operating income, and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for each of the periods indicated. \n\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n\n (1 ) Interest increased in 2015 to $43.2 million from $21.3 million in 2014 and from $8.2 million in 2013. These increases are primarily the result of interest expense related to $400 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes sold in July 2014 and $350 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes sold in May 2015. (2 ) Calculated on net income subsequent to initial public offering on December 14, 2011. (3 ) For a definition of Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\". \nResults of Operations by Reporting Segment\nTransportation\n\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin in this segment is generated by providing fee-based services and by entering into fixed-margin transactions. Revenues from fee-based services are included in service revenue and revenues from fixed-margin are included in product revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income. As there is no cost of sales or derivative activity associated with our Transportation revenue, Adjusted gross margin is equivalent to revenue for this segment.\n2015 versus 2014\nRevenues\nPipeline transportation revenue includes both fee-based and fixed-margin activity. Pipeline transportation revenues increased to $32 million in 2015 from $29 million in 2014. The extension of the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline in early 2015 resulted in an additional $7 million due to higher volumes. Higher volumes on the Tampa pipeline resulted in an additional $1 million. These increases were partially offset with reductions in fixed-margin and other fee-based activity of $3 million and $2 million, respectively.\nExternal truck transportation revenues decreased to $50 million in 2015 from $56 million in 2014. The decrease was due to a higher concentration of shorter haul activity despite higher volumes.\nIntersegment truck transportation revenues increased to $15 million in 2015 from $11 million in 2014. The increase was due to additional barrels purchased directly from the producer and hauled for our Supply and Logistics segment.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2015 to $74 million from $71 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to additional employment and insurance/taxes of $1 million and $1 million, respectively, resulting from a full year of operations from the crude oil trucking assets acquired in June 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased in 2015 to $9 million from $8 million in 2014, due primarily to a $2 million increase in overhead allocation from SemGroup to our trucking activity, partially offset by a $1 million reduction in\nemployment expense at our crude oil trucking division. This reduction was primarily due to lower incentive compensation and a restructuring of administrative positions.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased in 2015 to $36 million from $34 million in 2014. Approximately $2 million of the increase in depreciation expense is due to the 2014 revision of the estimated useful life relating to a section of the Kansas and Oklahoma pipeline system. An additional $5 million of the depreciation increase is due to project completions and the crude oil trucking fleet acquisition in 2014. Amortization decreased in 2015 to $1 million from $6 million in 2014. The decrease was due to contracts acquired as part of the crude oil trucking fleet acquisition in 2013 becoming fully amortized in 2014.\nLoss on Disposal or Impairment, net\nIn 2015, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $9.5 million associated with our crude oil trucking operations which reduced the carrying value of goodwill to $26.6 million.\nWe used a discounted cash flow model, supplemented by a market approach to perform the goodwill impairment analysis. Key assumptions in the analysis include the use of an appropriate discount rate, volume and rate forecasts and estimates of operating costs.\nWhen considering operating performance projections, we included industry economic conditions, current crude oil prices and the forward price curve. Due to the imprecise nature of our projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do differ from our estimates. If the assumptions used in our projections prove to be inaccurate, we could incur a future impairment charge.\nEarnings from Equity Method Investments\nEarnings from equity method investments increased in 2015 to $76 million from $57 million in 2014. The increase is due to our commissioning of White Cliffs' second line in August 2014 and our January 2015 acquisition of ownership interest in Glass Mountain. Earnings from White Cliffs increased by approximately $13 million and earnings from Glass Mountain increased by approximately $6 million in 2015 compared to 2014.\n2014 versus 2013\nRevenues\nPipeline transportation revenues increased to $29 million in 2014 from $21 million in 2013. The increase was due to capital expansion projects being placed in service near the end of 2013, including the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline. The Wattenberg Oil Trunkline and other fee-based activity contributed an additional $7 million and $1 million, respectively.\nExternal truck transportation revenues increased to $56 million in 2014 from $14 million in 2013. The increase was due to a full year of operations from the September 2013 crude oil trucking acquisition and a partial year of operations from the crude oil trucking assets acquired in June 2014.\nIntersegment truck transportation revenues began in late 2013. These revenues resulted from acquisitions of barrels purchased directly from the producer and hauled for our Supply and Logistics segment.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2014 to $71 million from $24 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to a full year of operations from the September 2013 crude oil trucking acquisition and a partial year of operations from the crude oil trucking assets acquired in June 2014. The increase included employment costs of $18 million, outside services from contract owner operators of $16 million, field expenses of $6 million, maintenance and repair of $2 million, insurance/taxes of $2 million, and other expense of $1 million. An additional $1 million and $1 million resulted from full year operations of the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline and the Tampa pipeline, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased in 2014 to $8 million from $5 million in 2013. The corporate overhead allocation from SemGroup increased $2 million as a result of higher corporate costs combined with a higher allocation rate attributable to Rose Rock. Employment costs increased $1 million primarily due to additional incentive compensation.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased in 2014 to $34 million from $18 million in 2013. Approximately $4 million of the depreciation increase is due to a revision of the estimated useful life relating to a 164-mile section of the Kansas and Oklahoma pipeline system. An additional $7 million of the depreciation increase is due to project completions and the crude oil trucking fleet acquisitions in 2013 and 2014. Amortization increased in 2014 to $6 million from $1 million in 2013 due to contracts acquired as part of the crude oil trucking fleet acquisitions in 2013 and 2014.\nEarnings from Equity Method Investments\nEarnings from equity method investments increased in 2014 to $57 million from $18 million in 2013. The increase in earnings is due to the acquisitions of additional interest in White Cliffs in December 2013 and June 2014.\nFacilities\n\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin in this segment is generated by providing fee-based services. Revenues from fee-based services are included in service revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income. As there is no cost of sales or derivative activity associated with our Facilities revenue, Adjusted gross margin is equivalent to revenue for this segment.\n2015 versus 2014\nRevenues\nRevenues increased in 2015 to $46 million from $44 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to additional unloading volumes at Platteville and additional pumpover activity at our storage facilities.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2015 to $9 million from $8 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to $1 million additional operating expenses from corporate headquarters and increased outside services.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense remained constant at $4 million in both 2015 and 2014.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased in 2015 to $6 million from $5 million in 2014. The increase is due to capital expenditure project completions.\n2014 versus 2013\nRevenue\nRevenues decreased in 2014 to $44 million from $47 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to reduced storage fees due to the conversion of 0.6 million barrels of storage capacity in Cushing for operational use.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2014 to $8 million from $7 million in 2013. The increase was due to $1 million of additional operations support expenses and increased employment related expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased in 2014 to $4 million from $3 million in 2013, primarily due to overhead allocations from SemGroup.\nGeneral\nIn every other category of expense, the amounts for the year ended 2014 are roughly equivalent to those for the year ended 2013.\nSupply and Logistics\n\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin in this segment is generated from marketing activities. Revenues from marketing activities are included in product revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe following table shows the Adjusted gross margin generated by this segment's marketing activities:\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of operating income to Adjusted gross margin, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for each of the periods indicated.\n\n2015 versus 2014\nRevenue\nRevenue decreased in 2015 to $717 million from $1.2 billion in 2014. \nGross product revenue increased in 2015 to $2.1 billion from $1.8 billion in 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the volume sold to 42.6 million barrels at an average sales price of $49 per barrel in 2015 from the volume sold of 19.1 million barrels at an average sales price of $95 per barrel in 2014.\nGross product revenue was reduced by $1.4 billion and $0.6 billion during 2015 and 2014, respectively, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 845-10-15, \"Nonmonetary Transactions\". ASC 845-10-15 requires that certain transactions -- those where inventory is purchased from a customer then resold to the same customer -- to be presented in the income statement on a net basis, resulting in a reduction of revenue and costs of products sold by the same amount.\nCost of Products Sold\nCosts of products sold decreased in 2015 to $687 million (including $15 million intersegment transportation expense) from $1.1 billion in 2014 (including $11 million intersegment transportation expense). The decrease was primarily due to reductions of $1.4 billion and $0.6 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15. There was an increase in the barrels sold, as described above, combined with a decrease in the average per barrel cost of crude oil to $48 in 2015 from $94 in 2014.\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin increased in 2015 to $32 million from $26 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in marketing volumes of 23.5 million barrels, partially offset by a lower spread between the acquisition and sale price for volumes of crude oil sold, as the excess of our average sales price per barrel over our average acquisition cost per barrel decreased to approximately $0.75 for 2015, from approximately $1.34 for 2014. The increase in volume was primarily due to crude oil blending and transactions related to contango market conditions.\nGeneral\nIn every other category of expense, the amounts for the year ended 2015 are roughly equivalent to those for the year ended 2014.\n2014 versus 2013\nRevenue\nGross product revenue increased in 2014 to $1.8 billion from $1.1 billion in 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the volume sold to 19.1 million barrels at an average sales price of $95 per barrel in 2014 from the volume sold of 11.0 million barrels, at an average sales price of $101 per barrel in 2013.\nGross product revenue was reduced by $645 million and $426 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15.\nCosts of Products Sold\nCosts of products sold increased in 2014 to $1.1 billion (including $11 million intersegment transportation expense) from $0.7 billion in 2013. Costs of products sold increased due to the increase in the barrels sold, as described above, combined with a decrease in the average cost per barrel of crude oil to $94 in 2014 from $99 in 2013. Costs of product sold reflected reductions of $645 million and $426 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15.\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nSupply and Logistics Adjusted gross margin increased in 2014 to $26 million from $21 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in marketing volumes of 8.1 million barrels, partially offset by a lower spread between the acquisition and sale price for volumes of crude oil sold, as the excess of our average sales price per barrel over our average acquisition cost per barrel decreased to approximately $1.34 for 2014, from approximately $1.87 for 2013. The increase in volume was primarily due to crude oil blending.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense decreased in 2014 to $1 million from $5 million in 2013. The decrease is due to the relocation of employees and certain trucking related activities from our North Dakota operations, which were included in our Supply and Logistics segment, to our Rose Rock Field Services operations, which are included in our Transportation segment.\nGeneral\nIn every other category of expense, the amounts for the year ended 2014 are roughly equivalent to those for the year ended 2013.\nCorporate and Other\n\nCorporate and Other is not a reportable segment and includes corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments and intersegment eliminations. This table is included to permit the reconciliation of segment information to that of the consolidated Partnership.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of short-term liquidity are cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Potential sources of long-term liquidity include the issuance of debt securities or common units and the sale of assets. Our primary cash requirements currently are operating expenses, capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to our unitholders and general partner. In general, we expect to fund:\n \u2022 operating expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and cash distributions through existing cash and cash from operating activities; \n \u2022 expansion related capital expenditures and working capital deficits through cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of debt securities and common units; \n \u2022 acquisitions through cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of debt securities and common units; and \n \u2022 debt principal payments through cash from operating activities and refinancing when the credit facility and senior unsecured notes become due.  Our ability to meet our financing requirements and fund our planned capital expenditures will depend on our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry. In addition, we are subject to conditions in the debt and equity markets for debt securities and limited partner units. There can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets in the future. If we would be unable or unwilling to access those markets, we could be required to restrict future expansion capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions.\nWe believe our cash from operations and our remaining borrowing capacity allow us to manage our day-to-day cash requirements, distribute the minimum quarterly distribution on all of our outstanding units and meet our capital expenditure commitments for the coming year.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our changes in cash and cash equivalents for the years presented (in thousands): \nOperating Activities\nThe components of operating cash flows can be summarized as follows (in thousands):\n\nWe experienced operating cash inflows of $82.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating cash flows were primarily driven by net income of $49.7 million, which included $61.2 million in non-cash expenses. The primary non-cash expenses were $42.0 million of depreciation and amortization and $10.3 million of loss on disposal or impairment, net principally the impairment of goodwill of our Transportation segment. Operating cash flows included $76.4 million of cash distributions which represent returns on our investments in White Cliffs and Glass Mountain. Net changes in operating assets\nand liabilities decreased operating cash flows by $28.0 million. The primary change was an increase in inventories of $35.0 million due to 1.1 million barrels of additional inventory. This is partially due to a strategic build to capture margins due to forward market crude oil prices being higher than spot market prices. Accounts payable, including payable to affiliates, and accrued liabilities increased by $15.8 million and accounts receivable, including receivable from affiliates, increased by $6.4 million. The impact to accounts receivable and accounts payable are subject to the timing of inventory purchases and sales and the timing of their related payments and collections.\nWe experienced operating cash inflows of $111.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating cash flows were primarily driven by net income of $62.9 million, which included $46.9 million of non-cash expenses. The primary non-cash expense was $40.0 million of depreciation and amortization. Operating cash flows included $57.4 million of cash distributions which represent returns on our investment in White Cliffs. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities had minimal impact on cash flow as changes in receivables and inventory were offset by changes in payables and accrued liabilities.\nWe experienced operating cash inflows of $73.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2013. Net income of $37.5 million included $23.7 million of non-cash expenses. The primary non-cash expense was $23.7 million of depreciation and amortization. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows by $12.1 million. The primary changes were an increase to accounts payable, including payable to affiliates, and accrued liabilities of $61.8 million and an increase in accounts receivable, including receivable from affiliates, of $43.0 million. The increases to accounts receivable, including receivable from affiliates, and accounts payable, including payable to affiliates, and accrued liabilities are primarily due to our ability to capture value related to market conditions and demand around our Kansas and Oklahoma system and Bakken Shale operations through marketing and buy/sell transactions and increased activity related to our acquisition of Barcas Field Services, LLC (\"Barcas\"). The impact to accounts receivable and accounts payable is subject to the timing of inventory purchases and sales and the timing of their related payments and collections. The increases in receivable from and payable to affiliates primarily relate to business acquisitions of SemGroup's equity method investee, NGL Energy, through which certain customers and suppliers became related parties.\nInvesting Activities\nWe experienced cash outflows from investing activities of $313.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 driven by $205.1 million for acquisitions, $86.3 million of capital expenditures and $46.7 million of contributions to equity method investments, partially offset by cash inflows of $24.1 million from distributions from equity investees in excess of equity in earnings. Acquisitions represent the historical cost of Wattenberg Oil Trunkline and a 50% interest in Glass Mountain purchased from SemGroup. Cash consideration in excess of historical cost is reported as a financing activity in the cash flow statement. Capital expenditures related to the Wattenberg Pipeline extension and other projects and contributions to equity method investments primarily related to capital calls to fund the expansion of the White Cliffs Pipeline.\nWe experienced cash outflows from investing activities of $239.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to the acquisition of crude oil trucking assets and the remaining interest in SCPL for an aggregate of $134.0 million, contributions of $54.9 million to White Cliffs related to expansion of the pipeline and capital expenditures of $61.3 million to expand our existing asset base, including our Platteville expansion, Tampa pipeline lateral and Wattenberg Oil Trunkline.\nWe experienced cash outflows from investing activities of $254.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 related to the acquisitions of Barcas and SCPL of $171.3 million, capital expenditures of $51.6 million, and contributions to equity method investment of $31.8 million, which related to capital calls to fund the White Cliffs Pipeline expansion.\nFinancing Activities\nWe experienced net cash inflows from financing activities of $236.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which were driven primarily by the issuance of $344.2 million of senior unsecured notes due 2023, net of a $5.8 million discount, and $89.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of common limited partner units, reduced by net payments of $32.0 million on our revolving credit facility ($342.0 million of borrowings less $374.0 million in principal payments), $112.9 million of cash distributions to partners and $46.3 million cash consideration in excess of historical cost of the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline and a 50% interest in Glass Mountain. Proceeds from the issuance of common limited partner units were primarily used to fund the acquisition of the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline and a 50% interest in Glass Mountain from SemGroup. Proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes due 2023 were used to pay amounts owed under our revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes.\nWe experienced net cash inflows from financing activities of $116.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 driven by $187.0 million of net borrowings on debt ($844.4 million of borrowings, net of $657.4 million of principal payments), $62.3 million of cash distributions to partners and $21.5 million of contributions from general partner. Borrowings included the issuance of $400 million of senior unsecured notes. Borrowings were used primarily to fund acquisitions. Cash\nflows from financing activities also reflect a $24.4 million cash distribution to SemGroup related to the SemCrude Pipeline acquisition. As this transaction was between entities under common control, Rose Rock recorded the acquired net assets at SemGroup's historical cost and the excess of the purchase price over the historical value was treated as an equity transaction. Contributions from and distributions to noncontrolling interests represent activity related to SemGroup's retained interest in SemCrude Pipeline prior to our acquisition of the remaining interest. Contributions from general partner of $21.5 million reflect funding for the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline prior to its acquisition from SemGroup in a common control transaction for which historical financial results have been recast.\nWe experienced net cash inflows from financing activities of $196.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 driven by $240.5 million of net borrowings on debt ($558.0 million of borrowings, net of $317.5 million of principal payments), $210.2 million of proceeds from issuance of common limited partner units, net of offering costs, $38.1 million of cash distributions to partners and $28.6 million of contributions from general partner. Borrowings were used primarily to fund acquisitions. Proceeds from issuances of common limited partner units were used to repay debt and fund acquisitions. Cash flows from financing activities also reflect a $240.6 million cash distribution to SemGroup related to the SemCrude Pipeline acquisition. As these transactions were between entities under common control, Rose Rock recorded the acquired net assets at SemGroup's historical cost and the excess of the purchase price over the historical value was treated as an equity transaction. Contributions from general partner of $28.6 million reflect funding for the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline prior to its acquisition from SemGroup in a common control transaction for which historical financial results have been recast.\nLong-term debt\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $400 million of senior unsecured notes outstanding, which become due in 2022, and $350 million of senior unsecured notes outstanding, which become due in 2023. At December 31, 2015, the borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility was $549.7 million, which includes the impact of $35.3 million of outstanding letters of credit which reduce the capacity available for borrowings. At December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility.\nThe credit agreement contains certain financial performance covenants. For any test period, our Leverage Ratio cannot be in excess of 5.50:1.00; our Senior Secured Leverage Ratio cannot be in excess of 3.50:1.00; and our Interest Coverage Ratio cannot be less than 2.50:1.00. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with our financial performance covenants.\nSee Note 8 of our accompanying financial statements for additional information regarding long-term debt.\nShelf Registration Statement\nWe have an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC that, subject to market conditions and effectiveness at the time of use, allows us to issue up to an aggregate of $500 million of debt or equity securities. In August 2013, we used this shelf registration statement to sell 4.75 million common units representing limited partner interests for proceeds of $152.5 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of $6.4 million. On February 13, 2015, we issued and sold 2.3 million common units representing limited partner interests for net proceeds of $89.1 million under this shelf. Proceeds were used in connection with our acquisition of the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline and a 50% interest in Glass Mountain from SemGroup. This shelf registration statement expires in May 2016.\nWe also have an effective shelf registration statement for the offer and sale, from time to time, of common units representing limited partner interests in us having an aggregate offering price of up to $150 million. We are able to make sales over a period of time and, from time to time, in transactions at prices which are market prices prevailing at the time of sale, prices related to market price or at negotiated prices. Such sales may be made pursuant to a sales agency financing agreement between us and certain underwriters or agents who may act as sales agents or purchase for their own accounts as principals. To date, no such sales have been made.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities and is a measure of our ability to pay our liabilities as they become due. Our working capital was $36.6 million and $9.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe increase in working capital at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 is primarily due to an additional 1.1 million barrels of crude oil inventory which is partially related to a strategic build to capture margins due to forward market crude oil prices being higher than spot market prices.\nCapital Requirements\nThe midstream energy business can be capital intensive, requiring significant investment for the maintenance of existing assets or acquisition or development of new systems and facilities. We categorize our capital expenditures as either:\n \u2022 expansion related capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long-term; or \n \u2022 maintenance capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures (including expenditures for the addition or improvement to, or the replacement of, our capital assets or for the acquisition of existing, or the construction or development of new capital assets) made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity.  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we invested cash of $86.3 million on capital projects, $46.7 million in contributions to our equity investees related to expansion projects and $205.1 million for acquisitions, exclusive of amounts in excess of historical cost on common control acquisitions and equity issued as consideration. Projected capital expenditures for 2016 include $25 million for expansion projects, including capital contributions to equity method investees to fund growth projects, and $10 million in maintenance projects.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to make significant expansion capital expenditures in the future. Consequently, our ability to develop and maintain sources of funds to meet our capital requirements is critical to our ability to meet our growth objectives. We expect that our future expansion capital expenditures will be funded by cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of debt and equity securities.\nDistributions\nThe following table sets forth cash distributions paid in 2014, 2015 and 2016:\n\nCredit Risk\nWe are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. We examine the creditworthiness of third-party customers to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of credit, prepayments or guarantees.\nCustomer Concentration\nShell Trading (US) Company and BP Oil Supply Company, each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, at approximately 54% and 16%, respectively. Shell Trading (US) Company and BP Oil Supply Company, each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, at approximately 60% and 15%, respectively. Shell Trading (US) Company and Tesoro Refining and Marketing Co., each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013, at approximately 31% and 15%, respectively. Although we have contracts with customers of varying duration, if one or more of our major customers were to default on their contract or if we were to be unable to renew our contract with one or more of these customers on favorable\nterms, we might not be able to replace any of these customers in a timely fashion, on favorable terms or at all. In any of these situations, our revenues and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders may be adversely affected. We expect our exposure to risk of non-payment or non-performance to continue as long as we remain substantially dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of business we enter into various contractual obligations for varying terms and amounts. The following table includes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015, and our best estimate of the period in which the obligations will be settled:\n\n (1) Assumes interest rates, fee rates and letters of credit and loans outstanding are as of December 31, 2015, and remain constant thereafter until maturity except for required principal payments. Letters of credit fees account for $1.6 million per year in 2016 and 2017 and $1.2 million in 2018. (2) The commitments shown in the table above relate to agreements to purchase product from a counterparty in connection with buy/sell agreements. Many of the commitments shown in the table above are cancellable by either party, as long as notice is given within", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe, and our significant equity method investees, own gathering systems, transportation pipelines, crude oil transport trucks, storage facilities and terminals in Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wyoming.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we made the decision to disaggregate certain activities and functions within the Partnership to provide additional granularity, both internally and externally, to our operating results. As such, the prior period results have been recast to reflect the resulting reportable segments.\nOur segments are organized by our key revenue generating activities:\nTransportation\nWe charge capacity or volume based fees to transport crude oil by pipeline and by truck. In addition, we generate the equivalent of a transportation fee by buying crude oil at one location and selling it back to the same counterparty at a different location for a fixed margin.\nFacilities\nWe charge capacity or volume based fees for crude oil storage and terminal services at our facilities in Cushing, along the Kansas and Oklahoma pipeline system and at Platteville, Colorado. We also charge capacity or volume based fees to use our truck unloading facility at Platteville.\nSupply and Logistics\nWe purchase crude oil for our own account from producers, aggregators and traders and sell crude oil, including crude oil blends, to traders and refiners.\nWe mitigate the commodity price exposure of our crude oil marketing operations by limiting our net open positions through (i) the concurrent purchase and sale of like quantities of crude oil to create back-to-back\u201d transactions intended to lock in positive margins based on the timing, location or quality of the crude oil purchased and delivered or (ii) derivative contracts. All of our marketing activities are subject to our Comprehensive Risk Management Policy, which establishes limits to manage risk and mitigate financial exposure.\nMore specifically, we use futures and swap contracts to manage our exposure to market changes in commodity prices to protect our Adjusted gross margin on our purchased crude oil. As we purchase crude oil from suppliers, we may establish either a fixed or a variable margin with future sales by:\n \u2022 selling a like quantity of crude oil for future physical delivery to create an effective back-to-back transaction; or \n \u2022 entering into futures and swaps contracts on the NYMEX or over-the-counter markets. \nGeneral Trends and Outlook\nThe price of crude oil has historically been volatile. For example, from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015, the NYMEX prompt month settle price ranged from a high of $107.26 per barrel to a low of $34.73 per barrel. For the year 2015, the range narrowed to a high of $61.43 per barrel to a low of $34.73 per barrel. Substantial declines in crude oil prices, particularly prolonged declines, can have negative effects on crude oil producers including:\n\u2022reduced revenue, operating income and cash flows;\n\u2022reduced volume of crude oil that can be produced economically;\n\u2022delayed or postponed capital projects; and/or\n\u2022limited access to or increased cost of capital, such as equity and long-term debt.\nThe substantial decline in crude oil prices since mid-2014 and continuing throughout 2015 have had these effects on a number of companies in the oil industry, including our customers. While we do not have significant direct exposure to crude oil\nprices, we are exposed to a reduction in volumes to be transported, stored and marketed as a result of lower prices. We experienced such reductions in 2015 and expect them to continue in 2016.\nIn response to these economic conditions, we are increasing our focus on controlling expenses, reviewing the economics of capital projects, increasing control over headcount and relocating our Oklahoma City office to Tulsa.\nInterest Rates\nThe credit markets have experienced very low interest rates recently. As the overall economy strengthens, it is likely that monetary policy will tighten, resulting in higher interest rates to counter possible inflation. If this occurs, interest rates on floating rate credit facilities and future offerings in the debt capital markets could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly.\nIn addition, there is a financing cost for the storage capacity used to carry the cost of the inventory while it is stored in the facility. That financing cost is impacted by the cost of capital or interest rate incurred by the storage user as well as the commodity cost of the crude oil in inventory. The higher the financing cost, the lower the margin that will remain from the price spread that was intended to be captured. Accordingly, a significant increase in interest rates could impact the demand for storage capacity independent of other market fundamentals.\nOur implied distribution yield is a product of our unit price and the level of our cash distributions. It is determined by dividing our annual cash distribution by our common unit price. The distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank related yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our common units, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price. In addition, increases in yield may hinder our ability to issue additional equity to make acquisitions, reduce debt or to fund other activities or working capital needs.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance. We view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and review these measurements on at least a monthly basis for consistency and trend analysis. These metrics include financial measures, including Adjusted gross margin, operating expenses and Adjusted EBITDA, and operating data, including contracted storage capacity and transportation, marketing and unloading volumes.\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nWe view Adjusted gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations, as well as our operating performance as compared to that of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis, capital structure or the impact of fluctuating commodity prices. We define Adjusted gross margin as total revenues minus cost of products sold and unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives. Adjusted gross margin allows us to make a meaningful comparison of the results across different commodity price environments because it measures the spread between the product sales price and cost of products sold. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d.\nOperating Expenses\nOur management seeks to maximize the profitability of our operations, in part, by minimizing operating expenses. These expenses are comprised of salary and wage expense, utility costs, insurance premiums, taxes and other operating costs, some of which are independent of the volumes we handle.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, earnings from equity method investments and any other non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus cash distributions from equity method investments. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance and liquidity measure to assess:\n \u2022 our operating performance as compared to that of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis, capital structure or the impact of fluctuating commodity prices; \n \u2022 the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our partners; \n \u2022 our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and \n \u2022 the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.  Contracted Storage Capacity and Transportation, Marketing and Unloading Volumes\nIn our Cushing storage operations, we charge our customers a fee for storage capacity provided, regardless of actual usage. On our Kansas and Oklahoma system, in our Bakken Shale operations and through our trucking fleet operations, we provide transportation services on a fee basis or pursuant to fixed-margin transactions, but in either case, the Adjusted gross margin we generate is dependent on the volume of crude oil transported (if on a fee basis) or purchased and sold (if pursuant to a fixed-margin transaction). We refer to these volumes, in the aggregate, as transportation volumes. Similarly, on our Kansas and Oklahoma system, and through our Bakken Shale operations, we conduct marketing activities involving the purchase and sale of crude oil or related derivative contracts. We refer to the crude oil volumes purchased and sold in our marketing operations as Supply and Logistics volumes. Finally, at our Platteville truck unloading facility, we charge our customers a fee based on the volumes unloaded. We refer to these as unloading volumes.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe define Adjusted gross margin as total revenues minus cost of products sold and unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, earnings from equity method investments, and any other non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus cash distributions from equity method investments.\nAdjusted gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations.\nOperating income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted gross margin, and net income (loss) and cash provided by (used in) operating activities are the GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider Adjusted gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nManagement compensates for the limitation of Adjusted gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between Adjusted gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA, on the one hand, and operating income (loss), net income (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, on the other hand, and incorporating this knowledge into its decision-making processes. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results.\nThe following tables present reconciliations of: (i) Adjusted gross margin to operating income, and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for each of the periods indicated.

Revenues from fee-based services are included in service revenue and revenues from fixed-margin are included in product revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income. As there is no cost of sales or derivative activity associated with our Transportation revenue, Adjusted gross margin is equivalent to revenue for this segment.\n2015 versus 2014\nRevenues\nPipeline transportation revenue includes both fee-based and fixed-margin activity. Pipeline transportation revenues increased to $32 million in 2015 from $29 million in 2014. The extension of the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline in early 2015 resulted in an additional $7 million due to higher volumes. Higher volumes on the Tampa pipeline resulted in an additional $1 million. These increases were partially offset with reductions in fixed-margin and other fee-based activity of $3 million and $2 million, respectively.\nExternal truck transportation revenues decreased to $50 million in 2015 from $56 million in 2014. The decrease was due to a higher concentration of shorter haul activity despite higher volumes.\nIntersegment truck transportation revenues increased to $15 million in 2015 from $11 million in 2014. The increase was due to additional barrels purchased directly from the producer and hauled for our Supply and Logistics segment.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2015 to $74 million from $71 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to additional employment and insurance/taxes of $1 million and $1 million, respectively, resulting from a full year of operations from the crude oil trucking assets acquired in June 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased in 2015 to $9 million from $8 million in 2014, due primarily to a $2 million increase in overhead allocation from SemGroup to our trucking activity, partially offset by a $1 million reduction in\nemployment expense at our crude oil trucking division. This reduction was primarily due to lower incentive compensation and a restructuring of administrative positions.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased in 2015 to $36 million from $34 million in 2014. Approximately $2 million of the increase in depreciation expense is due to the 2014 revision of the estimated useful life relating to a section of the Kansas and Oklahoma pipeline system. An additional $5 million of the depreciation increase is due to project completions and the crude oil trucking fleet acquisition in 2014. Amortization decreased in 2015 to $1 million from $6 million in 2014. The decrease was due to contracts acquired as part of the crude oil trucking fleet acquisition in 2013 becoming fully amortized in 2014.\nLoss on Disposal or Impairment, net\nIn 2015, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $9.5 million associated with our crude oil trucking operations which reduced the carrying value of goodwill to $26.6 million.\nWe used a discounted cash flow model, supplemented by a market approach to perform the goodwill impairment analysis. Key assumptions in the analysis include the use of an appropriate discount rate, volume and rate forecasts and estimates of operating costs.\nWhen considering operating performance projections, we included industry economic conditions, current crude oil prices and the forward price curve. Due to the imprecise nature of our projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do differ from our estimates. If the assumptions used in our projections prove to be inaccurate, we could incur a future impairment charge.\nEarnings from Equity Method Investments\nEarnings from equity method investments increased in 2015 to $76 million from $57 million in 2014. The increase is due to our commissioning of White Cliffs' second line in August 2014 and our January 2015 acquisition of ownership interest in Glass Mountain. Earnings from White Cliffs increased by approximately $13 million and earnings from Glass Mountain increased by approximately $6 million in 2015 compared to 2014.\n2014 versus 2013\nRevenues\nPipeline transportation revenues increased to $29 million in 2014 from $21 million in 2013. The increase was due to capital expansion projects being placed in service near the end of 2013, including the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline. The Wattenberg Oil Trunkline and other fee-based activity contributed an additional $7 million and $1 million, respectively.\nExternal truck transportation revenues increased to $56 million in 2014 from $14 million in 2013. The increase was due to a full year of operations from the September 2013 crude oil trucking acquisition and a partial year of operations from the crude oil trucking assets acquired in June 2014.\nIntersegment truck transportation revenues began in late 2013. These revenues resulted from acquisitions of barrels purchased directly from the producer and hauled for our Supply and Logistics segment.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2014 to $71 million from $24 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to a full year of operations from the September 2013 crude oil trucking acquisition and a partial year of operations from the crude oil trucking assets acquired in June 2014. The increase included employment costs of $18 million, outside services from contract owner operators of $16 million, field expenses of $6 million, maintenance and repair of $2 million, insurance/taxes of $2 million, and other expense of $1 million. An additional $1 million and $1 million resulted from full year operations of the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline and the Tampa pipeline, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased in 2014 to $8 million from $5 million in 2013. The corporate overhead allocation from SemGroup increased $2 million as a result of higher corporate costs combined with a higher allocation rate attributable to Rose Rock. Employment costs increased $1 million primarily due to additional incentive compensation.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased in 2014 to $34 million from $18 million in 2013. Approximately $4 million of the depreciation increase is due to a revision of the estimated useful life relating to a 164-mile section of the Kansas and Oklahoma pipeline system. An additional $7 million of the depreciation increase is due to project completions and the crude oil trucking fleet acquisitions in 2013 and 2014. Amortization increased in 2014 to $6 million from $1 million in 2013 due to contracts acquired as part of the crude oil trucking fleet acquisitions in 2013 and 2014.\nEarnings from Equity Method Investments\nEarnings from equity method investments increased in 2014 to $57 million from $18 million in 2013. The increase in earnings is due to the acquisitions of additional interest in White Cliffs in December 2013 and June 2014.\nFacilities\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating\n</td> <td>8,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>3,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>5,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposal or impairment, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>18,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin in this segment is generated by providing fee-based services. Revenues from fee-based services are included in service revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income. As there is no cost of sales or derivative activity associated with our Facilities revenue, Adjusted gross margin is equivalent to revenue for this segment.\n2015 versus 2014\nRevenues\nRevenues increased in 2015 to $46 million from $44 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to additional unloading volumes at Platteville and additional pumpover activity at our storage facilities.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2015 to $9 million from $8 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to $1 million additional operating expenses from corporate headquarters and increased outside services.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense remained constant at $4 million in both 2015 and 2014.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased in 2015 to $6 million from $5 million in 2014. The increase is due to capital expenditure project completions.\n2014 versus 2013\nRevenue\nRevenues decreased in 2014 to $44 million from $47 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to reduced storage fees due to the conversion of 0.6 million barrels of storage capacity in Cushing for operational use.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2014 to $8 million from $7 million in 2013. The increase was due to $1 million of additional operations support expenses and increased employment related expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased in 2014 to $4 million from $3 million in 2013, primarily due to overhead allocations from SemGroup.\nGeneral\nIn every other category of expense, the amounts for the year ended 2014 are roughly equivalent to those for the year ended 2013.\nSupply and Logistics\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>716,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,169,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>685,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of products sold\n</td> <td>686,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,142,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>663,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating\n</td> <td>995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>662\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposal or impairment, net\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>688,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,144,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>670,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin in this segment is generated from marketing activities.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in the volume sold to 42.6 million barrels at an average sales price of $49 per barrel in 2015 from the volume sold of 19.1 million barrels at an average sales price of $95 per barrel in 2014.\nGross product revenue was reduced by $1.4 billion and $0.6 billion during 2015 and 2014, respectively, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 845-10-15, \"Nonmonetary Transactions\". ASC 845-10-15 requires that certain transactions -- those where inventory is purchased from a customer then resold to the same customer -- to be presented in the income statement on a net basis, resulting in a reduction of revenue and costs of products sold by the same amount.\nCost of Products Sold\nCosts of products sold decreased in 2015 to $687 million (including $15 million intersegment transportation expense) from $1.1 billion in 2014 (including $11 million intersegment transportation expense). The decrease was primarily due to reductions of $1.4 billion and $0.6 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15. There was an increase in the barrels sold, as described above, combined with a decrease in the average per barrel cost of crude oil to $48 in 2015 from $94 in 2014.\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin increased in 2015 to $32 million from $26 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in marketing volumes of 23.5 million barrels, partially offset by a lower spread between the acquisition and sale price for volumes of crude oil sold, as the excess of our average sales price per barrel over our average acquisition cost per barrel decreased to approximately $0.75 for 2015, from approximately $1.34 for 2014. The increase in volume was primarily due to crude oil blending and transactions related to contango market conditions.\nGeneral\nIn every other category of expense, the amounts for the year ended 2015 are roughly equivalent to those for the year ended 2014.\n2014 versus 2013\nRevenue\nGross product revenue increased in 2014 to $1.8 billion from $1.1 billion in 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the volume sold to 19.1 million barrels at an average sales price of $95 per barrel in 2014 from the volume sold of 11.0 million barrels, at an average sales price of $101 per barrel in 2013.\nGross product revenue was reduced by $645 million and $426 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15.\nCosts of Products Sold\nCosts of products sold increased in 2014 to $1.1 billion (including $11 million intersegment transportation expense) from $0.7 billion in 2013. Costs of products sold increased due to the increase in the barrels sold, as described above, combined with a decrease in the average cost per barrel of crude oil to $94 in 2014 from $99 in 2013. Costs of product sold reflected reductions of $645 million and $426 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15.\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nSupply and Logistics Adjusted gross margin increased in 2014 to $26 million from $21 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in marketing volumes of 8.1 million barrels, partially offset by a lower spread between the acquisition and sale price for volumes of crude oil sold, as the excess of our average sales price per barrel over our average acquisition cost per barrel decreased to approximately $1.34 for 2014, from approximately $1.87 for 2013. The increase in volume was primarily due to crude oil blending.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense decreased in 2014 to $1 million from $5 million in 2013. The decrease is due to the relocation of employees and certain trucking related activities from our North Dakota operations, which were included in our Supply and Logistics segment, to our Rose Rock Field Services operations, which are included in our Transportation segment.\nGeneral\nIn every other category of expense, the amounts for the year ended 2014 are roughly equivalent to those for the year ended 2013.\nCorporate and Other\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,021\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(225\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of products sold\n</td> <td>(15,021\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(225\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>7,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>388\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss (gain) on disposal or impairment, net\n</td> <td>639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>(6,349\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,855\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,672\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,985\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,871\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate and Other is not a reportable segment and includes corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments and intersegment eliminations. This table is included to permit the reconciliation of segment information to that of the consolidated Partnership.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of short-term liquidity are cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Potential sources of long-term liquidity include the issuance of debt securities or common units and the sale of assets. Our primary cash requirements currently are operating expenses, capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to our unitholders and general partner. In general, we expect to fund:\n \u2022 operating expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and cash distributions through existing cash and cash from operating activities; \n \u2022 expansion related capital expenditures and working capital deficits through cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of debt securities and common units; \n \u2022 acquisitions through cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of debt securities and common units; and \n \u2022 debt principal payments through cash from operating activities and refinancing when the credit facility and senior unsecured notes become due.  Our ability to meet our financing requirements and fund our planned capital expenditures will depend on our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry. In addition, we are subject to conditions in the debt and equity markets for debt securities and limited partner units. There can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets in the future. If we would be unable or unwilling to access those markets, we could be required to restrict future expansion capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions.\nWe believe our cash from operations and our remaining borrowing capacity allow us to manage our day-to-day cash requirements, distribute the minimum quarterly distribution on all of our outstanding units and meet our capital expenditure commitments for the coming year.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our changes in cash and cash equivalents for the years presented (in thousands): Table 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(313,812\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(239,752\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(254,612\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>236,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>5,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,812\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n</td> <td>3,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe components of operating cash flows can be summarized as follows (in thousands):\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash expenses, net\n</td> <td>61,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net\n</td> <td>(28,044\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe experienced operating cash inflows of $82.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating cash flows were primarily driven by net income of $49.7 million, which included $61.2 million in non-cash expenses. The primary non-cash expenses were $42.0 million of depreciation and amortization and $10.3 million of loss on disposal or impairment, net principally the impairment of goodwill of our Transportation segment. Operating cash flows included $76.4 million of cash distributions which represent returns on our investments in White Cliffs and Glass Mountain. Net changes in operating assets\nand liabilities decreased operating cash flows by $28.0 million. The primary change was an increase in inventories of $35.0 million due to 1.1 million barrels of additional inventory. This is partially due to a strategic build to capture margins due to forward market crude oil prices being higher than spot market prices. Accounts payable, including payable to affiliates, and accrued liabilities increased by $15.8 million and accounts receivable, including receivable from affiliates, increased by $6.4 million. The impact to accounts receivable and accounts payable are subject to the timing of inventory purchases and sales and the timing of their related payments and collections.\nWe experienced operating cash inflows of $111.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating cash flows were primarily driven by net income of $62.9 million, which included $46.9 million of non-cash expenses. The primary non-cash expense was $40.0 million of depreciation and amortization. Operating cash flows included $57.4 million of cash distributions which represent returns on our investment in White Cliffs. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities had minimal impact on cash flow as changes in receivables and inventory were offset by changes in payables and accrued liabilities.\nWe experienced operating cash inflows of $73.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2013. Net income of $37.5 million included $23.7 million of non-cash expenses. The primary non-cash expense was $23.7 million of depreciation and amortization. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows by $12.1 million. The primary changes were an increase to accounts payable, including payable to affiliates, and accrued liabilities of $61.8 million and an increase in accounts receivable, including receivable from affiliates, of $43.0 million. The increases to accounts receivable, including receivable from affiliates, and accounts payable, including payable to affiliates, and accrued liabilities are primarily due to our ability to capture value related to market conditions and demand around our Kansas and Oklahoma system and Bakken Shale operations through marketing and buy/sell transactions and increased activity related to our acquisition of Barcas Field Services, LLC (\"Barcas\"). The impact to accounts receivable and accounts payable is subject to the timing of inventory purchases and sales and the timing of their related payments and collections. The increases in receivable from and payable to affiliates primarily relate to business acquisitions of SemGroup's equity method investee, NGL Energy, through which certain customers and suppliers became related parties.\nInvesting Activities\nWe experienced cash outflows from investing activities of $313.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 driven by $205.1 million for acquisitions, $86.3 million of capital expenditures and $46.7 million of contributions to equity method investments, partially offset by cash inflows of $24.1 million from distributions from equity investees in excess of equity in earnings. Acquisitions represent the historical cost of Wattenberg Oil Trunkline and a 50% interest in Glass Mountain purchased from SemGroup. Cash consideration in excess of historical cost is reported as a financing activity in the cash flow statement. Capital expenditures related to the Wattenberg Pipeline extension and other projects and contributions to equity method investments primarily related to capital calls to fund the expansion of the White Cliffs Pipeline.\nWe experienced cash outflows from investing activities of $239.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to the acquisition of crude oil trucking assets and the remaining interest in SCPL for an aggregate of $134.0 million, contributions of $54.9 million to White Cliffs related to expansion of the pipeline and capital expenditures of $61.3 million to expand our existing asset base, including our Platteville expansion, Tampa pipeline lateral and Wattenberg Oil Trunkline.\nWe experienced cash outflows from investing activities of $254.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 related to the acquisitions of Barcas and SCPL of $171.3 million, capital expenditures of $51.6 million, and contributions to equity method investment of $31.8 million, which related to capital calls to fund the White Cliffs Pipeline expansion.\nFinancing Activities\nWe experienced net cash inflows from financing activities of $236.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which were driven primarily by the issuance of $344.2 million of senior unsecured notes due 2023, net of a $5.8 million discount, and $89.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of common limited partner units, reduced by net payments of $32.0 million on our revolving credit facility ($342.0 million of borrowings less $374.0 million in principal payments), $112.9 million of cash distributions to partners and $46.3 million cash consideration in excess of historical cost of the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline and a 50% interest in Glass Mountain. Proceeds from the issuance of common limited partner units were primarily used to fund the acquisition of the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline and a 50% interest in Glass Mountain from SemGroup. Proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes due 2023 were used to pay amounts owed under our revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes.\nWe experienced net cash inflows from financing activities of $116.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 driven by $187.0 million of net borrowings on debt ($844.4 million of borrowings, net of $657.4 million of principal payments), $62.3 million of cash distributions to partners and $21.5 million of contributions from general partner. Borrowings included the issuance of $400 million of senior unsecured notes. Borrowings were used primarily to fund acquisitions. Cash\nflows from financing activities also reflect a $24.4 million cash distribution to SemGroup related to the SemCrude Pipeline acquisition. As this transaction was between entities under common control, Rose Rock recorded the acquired net assets at SemGroup's historical cost and the excess of the purchase price over the historical value was treated as an equity transaction. Contributions from and distributions to noncontrolling interests represent activity related to SemGroup's retained interest in SemCrude Pipeline prior to our acquisition of the remaining interest. Contributions from general partner of $21.5 million reflect funding for the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline prior to its acquisition from SemGroup in a common control transaction for which historical financial results have been recast.\nWe experienced net cash inflows from financing activities of $196.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 driven by $240.5 million of net borrowings on debt ($558.0 million of borrowings, net of $317.5 million of principal payments), $210.2 million of proceeds from issuance of common limited partner units, net of offering costs, $38.1 million of cash distributions to partners and $28.6 million of contributions from general partner. Borrowings were used primarily to fund acquisitions. Proceeds from issuances of common limited partner units were used to repay debt and fund acquisitions. Cash flows from financing activities also reflect a $240.6 million cash distribution to SemGroup related to the SemCrude Pipeline acquisition. As these transactions were between entities under common control, Rose Rock recorded the acquired net assets at SemGroup's historical cost and the excess of the purchase price over the historical value was treated as an equity transaction. Contributions from general partner of $28.6 million reflect funding for the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline prior to its acquisition from SemGroup in a common control transaction for which historical financial results have been recast.\nLong-term debt\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $400 million of senior unsecured notes outstanding, which become due in 2022, and $350 million of senior unsecured notes outstanding, which become due in 2023. At December 31, 2015, the borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility was $549.7 million, which includes the impact of $35.3 million of outstanding letters of credit which reduce the capacity available for borrowings. At December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility.\nThe credit agreement contains certain financial performance covenants. For any test period, our Leverage Ratio cannot be in excess of 5.50:1.00; our Senior Secured Leverage Ratio cannot be in excess of 3.50:1.00; and our Interest Coverage Ratio cannot be less than 2.50:1.00. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with our financial performance covenants.\nSee Note 8 of our accompanying financial statements for additional information regarding long-term debt.\nShelf Registration Statement\nWe have an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC that, subject to market conditions and effectiveness at the time of use, allows us to issue up to an aggregate of $500 million of debt or equity securities. In August 2013, we used this shelf registration statement to sell 4.75 million common units representing limited partner interests for proceeds of $152.5 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of $6.4 million. On February 13, 2015, we issued and sold 2.3 million common units representing limited partner interests for net proceeds of $89.1 million under this shelf. Proceeds were used in connection with our acquisition of the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline and a 50% interest in Glass Mountain from SemGroup. This shelf registration statement expires in May 2016.\nWe also have an effective shelf registration statement for the offer and sale, from time to time, of common units representing limited partner interests in us having an aggregate offering price of up to $150 million. We are able to make sales over a period of time and, from time to time, in transactions at prices which are market prices prevailing at the time of sale, prices related to market price or at negotiated prices. Such sales may be made pursuant to a sales agency financing agreement between us and certain underwriters or agents who may act as sales agents or purchase for their own accounts as principals. To date, no such sales have been made.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities and is a measure of our ability to pay our liabilities as they become due. Our working capital was $36.6 million and $9.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe increase in working capital at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 is primarily due to an additional 1.1 million barrels of crude oil inventory which is partially related to a strategic build to capture margins due to forward market crude oil prices being higher than spot market prices.\nCapital Requirements\nThe midstream energy business can be capital intensive, requiring significant investment for the maintenance of existing assets or acquisition or development of new systems and facilities. We categorize our capital expenditures as either:\n \u2022 expansion related capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long-term; or \n \u2022 maintenance capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures (including expenditures for the addition or improvement to, or the replacement of, our capital assets or for the acquisition of existing, or the construction or development of new capital assets) made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity.  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we invested cash of $86.3 million on capital projects, $46.7 million in contributions to our equity investees related to expansion projects and $205.1 million for acquisitions, exclusive of amounts in excess of historical cost on common control acquisitions and equity issued as consideration. Projected capital expenditures for 2016 include $25 million for expansion projects, including capital contributions to equity method investees to fund growth projects, and $10 million in maintenance projects.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to make significant expansion capital expenditures in the future. Consequently, our ability to develop and maintain sources of funds to meet our capital requirements is critical to our ability to meet our growth objectives. We expect that our future expansion capital expenditures will be funded by cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of debt and equity securities.\nDistributions\nThe following table sets forth cash distributions paid in 2014, 2015 and 2016:\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Record Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Distribution Per Unit\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 4, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 14, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.4650\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 5, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 15, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.4950\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 4, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 14, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.5350\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 4, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 14, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.5750\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 3, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 13, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.6200\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 5, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 15, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.6350\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 4, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 14, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.6500\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 3, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 13, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.6600\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 2, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 12, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.6600\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Risk\nWe are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. We examine the creditworthiness of third-party customers to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of credit, prepayments or guarantees.\nCustomer Concentration\nShell Trading (US) Company and BP Oil Supply Company, each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, at approximately 54% and 16%, respectively. Shell Trading (US) Company and BP Oil Supply Company, each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, at approximately 60% and 15%, respectively. Shell Trading (US) Company and Tesoro Refining and Marketing Co., each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013, at approximately 31% and 15%, respectively. Although we have contracts with customers of varying duration, if one or more of our major customers were to default on their contract or if we were to be unable to renew our contract with one or more of these customers on favorable\nterms, we might not be able to replace any of these customers in a timely fashion, on favorable terms or at all. In any of these situations, our revenues and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders may be adversely affected. We expect our exposure to risk of non-payment or non-performance to continue as long as we remain substantially dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of business we enter into various contractual obligations for varying terms and amounts.
