Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n2015 HIGHLIGHTS\nEarnings from continuing operations increased significantly (versus 2014) reflecting several factors, including the benefit from higher sales, pricing discipline, and lower foam litigation expense.\nSales from continuing operations also grew in 2015, with higher unit volume and acquisitions partially offset by raw material-related price deflation and currency impact. Nearly all of our businesses experienced unit volume growth during the year, from a combination of new program awards, market share gains, and broadly improving end market demand.\nA major component of our strategy since 2007 has been the optimization of our portfolio of businesses, by increasing investment in businesses that possess strong competitive advantage and reducing our exposure to businesses and markets that are less attractive. In 2015, we made further progress on both fronts. During the year, we expanded our operations to support continued growth of our Automotive business, invested in machinery to support the growing demand for ComfortCore\u00ae innersprings, and added three new facilities to support growth in our Adjustable Bed business. We also acquired, in our Work Furniture business, a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial, and other settings. Additionally, in 2015, we completed the divestitures of several small operations including our Steel Tubing business, the two remaining Store Fixtures operations, and a small part of the Commercial Vehicle Products business.\nOperating cash decreased versus 2014 levels, primarily due to payments made to settle foam litigation. However, we once again generated more than enough cash from operations to comfortably fund dividends and capital expenditures, something we've accomplished for over 25 years.\n2015 marked the 44th consecutive annual dividend increase for the company, with a compound annual growth rate of 13% over that time period. Only one other S&P 500 company can claim as high a rate of dividend growth for as many years.\nOur financial profile remains strong. We ended 2015 with net debt to net capital comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30-40%. In August, we repaid $200 million of notes that matured. We ended the year with over $400 million available under our commercial paper program.\nWe assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return (TSR) to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis. We target TSR in the top third of the S&P 500 over the long term. For the three years ended December 31, 2015, we generated TSR of 20% per year on average. That placed us in the top third of the S&P 500, meeting our long-term goal.\nThese topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.\nPART II\nINTRODUCTION\nTotal Shareholder Return\nTotal Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance. TSR is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay [TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price]. We seek to achieve TSR in the top third of the S&P 500 over the long-term through a balanced approach that employs four TSR drivers: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.\nWe monitor our TSR performance (relative to the S&P 500) on a rolling three-year basis. For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2015, we met our top third TSR goal. We generated TSR of 20% per year on average over the last three years, well above the S&P 500's 15% annual TSR for that same time period.\nCustomers\nWe serve a broad suite of customers, with our largest customer representing approximately 8% of our sales. Many are companies whose names are widely recognized. They include most producers of residential furniture and bedding, auto and office seating manufacturers, and a variety of other companies.\nMajor Factors That Impact Our Business\nMany factors impact our business, but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand, raw material cost trends, and competition.\nMarket Demand\nMarket demand (including product mix) is impacted by several economic factors, with consumer confidence being most significant. Other important factors include disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, and interest rates. All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and therefore affect demand for our components and products. Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.\nRaw Material Costs\nIn many of our businesses, we enjoy a cost advantage from being vertically integrated into steel wire and rod. This is a benefit that our competitors do not have. We also experience favorable purchasing leverage from buying large quantities of raw materials. Still, our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials (many of which are commodities) fluctuate.\nWe typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market. Our ability to recover higher costs (through selling price increases) is crucial. When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs. Conversely, when costs decrease significantly, we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers. The timing of our price increases or decreases is important; we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs and we also realize a lag as costs decline, as was the case in the last half of 2015.\nSteel is our principal raw material. At various times in past years we have experienced significant cost fluctuations in this commodity. In most cases, the major changes (both increases and decreases) were passed through to customers with selling price adjustments. Throughout 2015, market prices for steel scrap, rod, and flat-rolled products decreased significantly, leading to downward pressure on selling prices. We realized a beneficial\nPART II\npricing lag during the year, as costs generally decreased at a faster rate than selling prices. Assuming that steel costs stabilize, we expect that 2015's pricing lag benefit will not recur in 2016.\nAs a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by changes in metal margins (the difference between the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod). Metal margins within the steel industry have been volatile during certain periods in recent years. In late 2013 and early 2014, metal margins decreased significantly as market conditions did not allow full recovery of higher scrap costs. An antidumping and countervailing duty case filed in January 2014 by major U.S. steel wire rod producers was concluded in December 2014, resulting in the implementation of duties on imports of Chinese steel wire rod. The antidumping duties range from 106% to 110% and the countervailing duties range from 178% to 193%. Both remain in effect through December 2019.\nOur other raw materials include woven and non-woven fabrics, foam scrap, and chemicals. We have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in recent years, and in most years, have been able to pass them through to our customers.\nWhen we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs, this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components. We must continue providing product options to our customers that enable them to improve the functionality and manage the cost of their products, while providing higher margin and profit contribution for our operations.\nCompetition\nMany of our markets are highly competitive, with the number of competitors varying by product line. In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies. Many of our competitors, both domestic and foreign, compete primarily on the basis of price. Our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive, while delivering better product quality, innovation, and customer service.\nWe continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities. However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.\nSince 2009, there have been antidumping duty orders on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%. In March 2014, the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that the duties should be continued. In April 2014, the DOC published its final order continuing the duties through February 2019 (for China) and December 2018 (for South Africa and Vietnam).\nBecause of the documented evasion of antidumping orders by certain importers, typically shipping goods through third countries and falsely identifying the countries of origin, Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers have formed a coalition and are working with members of Congress, the DOC, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders. As a result of these efforts, the U.S. Congress passed the Enforcing Orders and Reducing Customs Evasion (ENFORCE) Act. The ENFORCE Act requires CBP to implement a transparent, time-limited process to investigate allegations of duty evasion and to assess duties where appropriate.\nPART II\nSettlement of Polyurethane Foam Litigation\nWe previously disclosed that we were one of several defendants in a series of civil antitrust lawsuits involving the sale of polyurethane foam. During 2015, we settled the substantial majority of these cases. Although there are a few cases yet to be resolved, based upon current facts, we do not believe that the outcome of these remaining cases will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flow.\nAccrual for Loss Contingencies and Reasonably Possible Losses in Excess of Accruals\nAlthough we deny liability in all threatened or pending litigation proceedings and believe that we have valid bases to contest all claims made against us, we have an aggregate litigation contingency accrual of $8 million. The accrual amount decreased from the prior year primarily due to cash payments for litigation settlements of $82 million. Based upon current facts and circumstances, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable) losses in excess of the recorded accruals for litigation contingencies are estimated to be $25 million. These include Brazilian VAT, antitrust, patent, and other matters. For more information regarding litigation contingency accruals and reasonably possible losses in excess of accruals, see Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 114.\nLeggett's Claim for Alleged Antitrust Violations\nWe are also a plaintiff in an antitrust case against The Dow Chemical Company. We, along with other plaintiffs, have alleged that several defendants conspired to fix prices and allocate customers and markets for certain urethane chemical products. The trial is scheduled to begin on March 7, 2016. We believe that it is reasonably likely that we may recover material damages. However, because of uncertainties we cannot estimate the amount of recovery, and it is possible that we won't recover any damages at all. For more information regarding our antitrust litigation, see Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 114.\nDiscontinued Operations\nFor information regarding discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 76.\nGoodwill Impairment of Store Fixtures Group\nA significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. We review our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in June of each year, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review in June 2014, and on July 14, 2014, concluded that an impairment charge of $108 million ($93 million after tax) was required for our Store Fixtures group. This non-cash impairment charge reflected the complete write-off of the goodwill associated with the Store Fixtures group and was recognized in discontinued operations. For more information, see Note C to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.\nDivestiture of Store Fixtures Operations\nOn November 1, 2014, we sold the majority of the Store Fixtures business for $64 million. These divested operations represented approximately three-quarters of the business unit's revenues. The transaction resulted in an after-tax loss of $5 million, which was recognized in discontinued operations.\nThe two remaining Store Fixtures facilities were sold in 2015 and resulted in an after-tax gain of $3 million, which was also recognized in discontinued operations.\nPART II\nCommercial Vehicle Products Divestiture\nIn late 2015, we sold a small CVP operation that did not meet the discontinued operations criteria, leaving two remaining operations within that group. In February 2016, one of these operations reached held-for-sale status. Under a separate arrangement, we have agreed to sell real estate associated with the CVP unit and expect to realize a gain on this transaction. The real estate sale is subject to certain contingencies, which we anticipate will be resolved within the next twelve months. We will continue to explore strategic alternatives for the remaining CVP operation.\nChange in Segment Reporting\nOur reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure. Because of the divestiture of the majority of the Store Fixtures business in late 2014, along with the retirement of the Senior Operating Vice President of the Industrial Materials segment, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed in 2015.\nThe Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses were moved from Residential Furnishings to Commercial Products. The Aerospace business was moved from Industrial Materials to Specialized Products. The Spuhl machinery operation (which produces wire forming equipment primarily for our internal use) was moved from Specialized Products to Residential Furnishings. Additionally, our logistics operations, which primarily include intercompany transportation activity, were moved from Residential Furnishings to Industrial Materials. These segment changes were retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented.\nPART II\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS-2015 vs. 2014\nSales from continuing operations grew 4% in 2015, with higher unit volume and acquisitions partially offset by raw material-related price deflation and currency impact. Nearly all of our businesses experienced unit volume growth during the year, from a combination of new program awards, market share gains, and broadly improving end market demand.\nFull year earnings from continuing operations increased significantly reflecting several factors, including the benefit from higher sales, pricing discipline, and lower foam litigation expense. Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.\nConsolidated Results (continuing operations)\nThe following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from continuing operations during 2015, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales (continuing operations):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Approximate volume gains\n</td> <td>196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Approximate raw material-related deflation and currency impact\n</td> <td>(183\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same location sales\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition sales growth\n</td> <td>123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Divestitures\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from continuing operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts, net of tax)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lower foam litigation expense\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lump sum pension buyout\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, including benefit from higher sales and pricing discipline\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings Per Diluted Share (continuing operations)-2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings Per Diluted Share (continuing operations)-2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSame location sales (from continuing operations) grew 1%, with volume gains in Automotive, in most of our Residential Furnishings businesses, and in Adjustable Bed, largely offset by raw material-related price deflation and currency impact.\nFull-year 2015 sales growth also benefited from the July 2014 acquisition of Tempur Sealy's three innerspring component production facilities, the March 2015 acquisition of a Work Furniture business, and other smaller acquisitions. The divestiture of the Steel Tubing business occurred in late December, and did not significantly impact the full year sales comparison.\nEarnings from continuing operations increased significantly in 2015, primarily from higher sales and pricing discipline. As indicated in the table above, earnings also benefited from the reduction in foam litigation expense ($3 million in 2015 versus $33 million in 2014; further discussed on page 114). Partially offsetting these improvements was a one-time lump sum pension buyout funded from pension plan assets late in 2015.\nPART II\nLIFO Impact\nAll of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory. In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e., outside the segments) to convert about 50% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories. In 2014, steel costs were relatively stable and we ended the year with LIFO expense of $1 million. Significant deflation in steel costs during 2015 resulted in a full-year pretax LIFO benefit of $46 million.\nFor further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72.\nInterest and Income Taxes\nNet interest expense in 2015 increased slightly versus 2014.\nOur 2015 worldwide effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 27%, compared to 24% for 2014. The 2015 tax rate benefited from $11 million of favorable adjustments, including a reduction associated with changes to our permanent reinvestment assertions in China, and a tax benefit associated with our Australian operations. The 2014 tax rate includes $14 million of favorable adjustments primarily related to additional Domestic Production Activities Deduction tax benefits for the current and prior years, incremental deferred foreign tax credits, and net favorable adjustments related to prior year tax return filings. These adjustments benefited our 2014 rate more favorably due to lower pretax income.\nPART II\nSegment Results (continuing operations)\nIn the following section we discuss 2015 sales and EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) from continuing operations for each of our segments. We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84. Prior year segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the change in segment structure discussed on page 31.\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Volume grew in Bedding, Home Furniture, Geo Components, and Fabric Converting. Within our U.S. Spring business, we again experienced significant growth in ComfortCore\u00ae (our pocketed coil innerspring), with unit volume in that product category up 51%. We expect strong growth in this category to continue from our introduction of new ComfortCore\u00ae products and our customers' growing use of these components in their product lines.\nEBIT and EBIT margin increased in 2015 due to higher sales, pricing discipline, and significantly lower foam litigation expense ($48 million).\nPART II\nCommercial Products\nSales in Commercial Products increased 21% in 2015, with same location sales up 12%. Continued strong demand in the Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses drove this improvement. Unit volume in the Adjustable Bed business increased 51% from a combination of new programs and strength in ongoing customer programs. Acquisitions also contributed 9% to the segment's sales growth during the year. In our Work Furniture business, we acquired a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial, and other settings.\nEBIT and EBIT margin increased in 2015, primarily from higher sales and improved operating efficiency.\nIndustrial Materials\nSales in the segment decreased 4% in 2015, with higher unit volume in Drawn Wire more than offset by steel-related price decreases and reduced rod mill trade sales.\nEBIT and EBIT margin improved versus 2014, with cost reductions more than offsetting $6 million of impairment charges and a $3 million loss on divestiture, both of which related to our Steel Tubing business.\nSpecialized Products\nIn Specialized Products, sales increased 4% in 2015, with volume gains in Automotive and Machinery partially offset by currency impact. Our Automotive business continued to experience strong growth from a combination of factors, including expanded component content (via upgraded features), participation in new vehicle platforms, and continued industry growth in each of the major markets.\nEBIT and EBIT margin increased primarily from higher sales.\nResults from Discontinued Operations\nFull year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased to $1 million from a loss of $124 million in 2014. This significant increase is primarily due to the non-recurrence of an impairment charge of $93 million related to the goodwill of the Store Fixtures business discussed on page 80, and foam litigation accruals of $22 million discussed on page 114. The divestiture of the majority of that business late in 2014 resulted in an additional loss of $5 million. For further information about discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 76.\nPART II\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS-2014 vs. 2013\nSales from continuing operations grew 9% in 2014 from a combination of strong organic growth in many of our major businesses and acquisitions. Earnings from continuing operations increased in 2014, largely due to sales growth. Other items in 2013 and 2014 essentially offset.\nFurther details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.\nConsolidated Results (continuing operations)\nThe following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from continuing operations during 2014, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales (continuing operations):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same location sales - primarily unit volume growth\n</td> <td>189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition sales growth\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from continuing operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts, net of tax)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-recurrence of Commercial Vehicle Products impairment and related charges\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-recurrence of acquisition-related bargain purchase gain\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation accrual\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other factors, including benefit from higher sales\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings Per Diluted Share (continuing operations)-2013\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings Per Diluted Share (continuing operations)-2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSame location sales (from continuing operations) grew 6%, reflecting strong volume gains in Automotive and in most of the company's Residential Furnishings businesses. These improvements were partially offset by weak demand in Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP).\nSales growth in 2014 also benefited from the acquisition of Tempur Sealy's three innerspring component production facilities and other smaller acquisitions. In conjunction with the purchase of the facilities from Tempur Sealy, we expanded and extended our supply relationship and became the exclusive long-term provider in the U.S. and Canada of wire-based innersprings for Tempur Sealy and boxsprings for Sealy.\nEarnings from continuing operations increased in 2014, with several items contributing to the year-over-year comparison. Operationally, earnings growth resulted primarily from higher sales, however this benefit was partially offset by higher stock compensation expense that resulted in large part from the significant increase in Leggett & Platt share price versus the market in late 2014. Reduced metal margins in our steel rod and wire operations and weather-related costs and inefficiencies early in the year also offset some of the earnings benefit from higher sales.\nAs indicated in the table above, a few additional items impacted the year-over-year earnings comparison. In 2013, earnings from continuing operations reflected non-cash impairment and other charges related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of our CVP business, and a bargain purchase gain related to the acquisition of an\nPART II\naerospace tubing business. Earnings from continuing operations in 2014 were negatively impacted by litigation accruals, which primarily related to the foam antitrust cases discussed on page 114.\nLIFO Impact\nAll of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory. In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e., outside the segments) to convert about 50% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories. Steel inflation in late 2013 resulted in full-year LIFO expense of $4 million. In 2014, steel costs were relatively stable and we ended the year with LIFO expense of $1 million.\nFor further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72.\nInterest and Income Taxes\nNet interest expense in 2014 decreased slightly versus 2013.\nOur 2014 worldwide effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 24%, compared to 22% for 2013. The 2014 tax rate benefited from $14 million of favorable adjustments, including additional Domestic Production Activities Deduction tax benefits for the current and prior years, incremental deferred foreign tax credits, and net favorable adjustments related to prior year tax return filings. The 2013 tax rate includes $17 million of favorable adjustments primarily related to the impact of Mexico tax law changes, the settlement of certain foreign and state tax audits, and a non-taxable bargain purchase gain.\nPART II\nSegment Results (continuing operations)\nIn the following section we discuss 2014 sales and EBIT from continuing operations for each of our segments. We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84. All segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the change in segment structure discussed on page 31.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Overall company margin is calculated on external sales.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResidential Furnishings\nResidential Furnishings sales increased 14% in 2014, from unit volume growth in most product categories and acquisitions (including the purchase of the three Tempur Sealy innerspring production facilities). Volume grew in Bedding, Home Furniture, Geo Components, Fabric Converting, and Carpet Cushion, from a combination of market share gains and broadly improving market demand in the second half of the year. Within our U.S. Spring business, we experienced significant growth in ComfortCore\u00ae (our pocketed coil innerspring), with unit volume in that product category up 52%. Mattress producers continued to integrate these higher-valued innersprings into more of their product lines, in many cases replacing lower-valued innersprings. In our Furniture Hardware business, unit volume increased 10% as consumer demand for reclining chairs and sofas continued to grow.\nEBIT and EBIT margin decreased in 2014, with the benefit from higher sales more than offset by a $54 million accrual related to the foam litigation discussed on page 114, and higher stock compensation expense.\nPART II\nCommercial Products\nSales in Commercial Products increased 10% in 2014. Demand was extremely strong in our Adjustable Bed business, with unit volume increasing 56% from a combination of new programs and strength in ongoing customer programs. We also benefited from market share gains and improved market demand in our Work Furniture business.\nEBIT improved slightly and EBIT margin was flat in 2014, with the benefit from higher sales partially offset by operational challenges with a Chinese joint venture.\nIndustrial Materials\nSales in the segment increased 3% in 2014. Growth in logistics services (primarily with other Leggett operations) was partially offset by reduced trade sales from our rod mill and lower wire volume.\nEBIT and EBIT margin declined versus 2013, primarily due to reduced metal margin in our steel rod and wire operations, and weather-related costs and inefficiencies early in 2014.\nSpecialized Products\nIn Specialized Products, sales increased 12% in 2014. Same location sales were up 8% and Aerospace acquisitions completed in 2013 also contributed to the full-year sales growth. Our Automotive business continued to experience strong growth, with sales up 17% from a combination of factors, including expanded component content (via upgraded features), participation in new vehicle platforms, and demand strength in each of the major markets. Partially offsetting this growth, CVP sales declined 21%, reflecting delayed vehicle replacement by major fleet operators and a change in an OEM incentive program. Machinery sales increased modestly for the year.\nEBIT and EBIT margin increased due to higher sales and the non-recurrence of impairment and other charges (of $67 million) related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of our CVP business that were recognized in 2013.\nResults from Discontinued Operations\nFull year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased to a loss of $124 million in 2014 (versus earnings of $13 million in 2013). This significant decline is primarily due to an impairment charge of $93 million related to the goodwill of the Store Fixtures business discussed on page 80, and foam litigation accruals of $22 million discussed on page 114. The divestiture of the majority of that business late in 2014 resulted in an additional loss of $5 million. Earnings in 2013 reflected an $8 million tax benefit attributable to another small operation. For further information about discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 76.\nPART II\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITALIZATION\nOur operations provide most of the cash we require, and debt may also be used to fund a portion of our needs. Cash from operations was once again strong in 2015. For over 25 years, our operations have provided more than enough cash to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments. We expect this to again be the case in 2016.\nCapital expenditures increased in 2015 from investments to support growth in Automotive, U.S. Spring, and Adjustable Bed. We increased the quarterly dividend and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 44 years. We also bought back 4.3 million shares of our stock during the year.\nIn August 2015, we repaid $200 million of 5.0% notes that matured. We ended 2015 with over $400 million of our commercial paper program available. Net debt to net capital at year end was 34.5%, within our long-standing targeted range of 30-40%. The calculation of net debt as a percent of net capital is presented on page 47.\nCash from Operations\nCash from operations is our primary source of funds. Earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations.\nCash from operations decreased in 2015. Though earnings increased during the year, the benefit to operating cash flow was more than offset by foam litigation payments totaling $82 million. The decrease in 2014 (versus 2013) was primarily from higher accounts receivable associated with increased sales volume late in that year.\nWith the foam litigation settlements largely complete, we expect cash from operations to approximate $450 million in 2016.\nPART II\nWe continue to closely monitor our working capital levels, and ended 2015 with adjusted working capital at 9.5% of annualized sales1. The table below explains this non-GAAP calculation. We eliminate cash and current debt maturities from working capital to monitor our performance related to operating efficiency and believe this provides a more useful measurement. The increase in adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized sales in 2015 primarily reflects decreased litigation accruals from payments made during the year.\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current liabilities\n</td> <td>(701\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(992\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital\n</td> <td>610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>438\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(253\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(333\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current debt maturities\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted working capital\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized sales 1\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized sales\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital as a percent of annualized sales\n</td> <td>16.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________________\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.\n</td> <td>Annualized sales equal 4th quarter sales ($945 million in 2015 and $953 million in 2014) multiplied by 4. We believe measuring our working capital against this sales metric is more useful, since efficient management of working capital includes adjusting those net asset levels to reflect current business volume.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThree primary components of our working capital are discussed below.\nTrade Receivables - The payment trends by our major customers remained stable in 2015, with slight improvements in full year bad debt expense compared to 2014 levels. We continue to look for ways to improve payment patterns of customers and offer programs with incentives for early payment offered in conjunction with third parties when appropriate. Trade Receivables decreased slightly in 2015, primarily due to price deflation and currency translation impacts.\nTotal Inventories - The physical flow of materials through our production facilities is materially the same as in prior periods, and we are not experiencing a buildup of inventory. Expense associated with slow moving and obsolete inventories in 2015 was generally in line with that of 2014. Further, we review usage and inventory quantities at the part number level to determine if current inventory amounts are recoverable by future demand, and reserve necessary amounts on a timely basis.\nFIFO Inventory decreased in 2015 primarily due to significant steel-related price deflation and currency fluctuations. These decreases were partially offset by the timing of certain customer orders late in the year, opportunistic purchases of raw materials, and continued sales growth (which requires additional inventory for support).\nThe increase in our fourth quarter DIO is directly related to the effects of the LIFO method of accounting for inventories and the significant deflation in steel prices during 2015. Under LIFO accounting, the most recent raw material purchases are assumed to be the first consumed in production. Significant steel price deflation resulted in a significant decrease in our LIFO reserves, particularly in the fourth quarter, making comparability to prior quarter's DIO difficult.\nAccounts Payable - Our payment terms are materially consistent with our past practices. We strive to optimize payment terms with our vendors and third parties that allow flexible payment options. Our accounts payable balance decreased at December 31, 2015 vs. 2014 primarily due to steel deflation (that led to lower cost of raw material purchases), currency fluctuations, and timing of payments for inventory purchases. Steel deflation (which was particularly sharp in the fourth quarter), also drove a decrease in our fourth quarter 2015 DPO.\nPART II\nThe following table presents dollar amounts of key working capital components at the end of the past two years.\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount (in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade Receivables, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories at FIFO\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LIFO Reserve\n</td> <td>(23\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total inventories at LIFO, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts Payable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(63\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe next chart shows recent trends in key working capital components (expressed in numbers of days at the end of the past five quarters).\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.\n</td> <td>The inventory ratio represents days of inventory on hand calculated as: ending net inventory \u00f7 (quarterly cost of goods sold \u00f7 number of days in the quarter).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.\n</td> <td>The trade receivables ratio represents the days of sales outstanding calculated as: ending net trade receivables \u00f7 (quarterly net sales \u00f7 number of days in the quarter).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.\n</td> <td>The accounts payable ratio represents the days of payables outstanding calculated as: ending accounts payable \u00f7 (quarterly cost of goods sold \u00f7 number of days in the quarter).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPART II\nUses of Cash\nFinance Capital Requirements\nCash is readily available to fund selective growth, both internally (through capital expenditures) and externally (through acquisitions).\nIn certain of our businesses and product lines we have minimal excess capacity, and we are investing to support continued growth. In Automotive, we are expanding capacity to support new programs that will begin production in 2016 and later years. In Bedding, we are investing in equipment (that we build in our own Swiss operation) to support ongoing growth in ComfortCore\u00ae innersprings. In Adjustable Bed, which operated a single large location until 2015, we have added new locations to broaden our geographic scope and now operate four facilities in North America.\nIn many of our other businesses, we have available capacity to accommodate additional volume. For each additional $100 million of sales from incremental unit volume produced utilizing spare capacity, we expect to generate approximately $25 million to $35 million of additional pre-tax earnings. With market share gains and higher market demand, our capacity utilization has increased. The earnings and margin improvement that we have realized over the past few years reflects, in part, that higher utilization.\nWe will continue to make investments to support growth in businesses and product lines where sales are strong, and for efficiency improvement and maintenance. We expect capital expenditures to approximate $130 million in 2016. Our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital. This emphasis heightens the focus on asset utilization and helps ensure that we are investing additional capital dollars where attractive return potential exists.\nOur strategic, long-term, 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions. We are seeking acquisitions primarily within our business units that have been designated as Grow businesses, and are looking for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).\nIn 2013, we acquired two small businesses that supply tubing and tubing sub-assemblies to the aerospace market.\nPART II\nIn 2014, we purchased the three Tempur Sealy U.S. innerspring component production facilities for $45 million. We also acquired a German designer and distributor of high-end, European-styled motion components for residential furniture.\nIn 2015, we acquired a 70% interest in a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial, and other settings for $23 million. This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally.\nAdditional details about these and other smaller acquisitions can be found in Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 109.\nPay Dividends\nIncreasing the dividend remains a high priority. In 2015, we increased the quarterly dividend to $.32 per share and extended our record of consecutive annual dividend increases to 44 years, at an average compound growth rate of 13%. Our targeted dividend payout ratio is approximately 50-60% of net earnings, however the actual payout has been higher in recent years. As a result, dividend growth in recent years has been modest, at about 3% per year. With significant earnings improvement in 2015, the dividend payout ratio for the year was within the target range. This should allow us flexibility to consider future dividend growth that more closely aligns with earnings growth.\nDuring 2012, we declared four quarterly dividends, but paid five, given our decision to accelerate into December 2012 the dividend typically paid in January 2013 (of $41 million) in anticipation of tax rate increases on individual taxpayers. In 2013, we returned to our prior practice and paid the fourth quarter dividend in January 2014. Therefore, the cash requirement for dividends in 2013 was lower, at $125 million.\nPART II\nRepurchase Stock\nAs shown in the chart above, share repurchases were significant in each of the last three years. During that time frame, we repurchased a total of 15.6 million shares of our stock and issued 9.1 million shares (through employee benefit plans and stock option exercises), reducing outstanding shares by 5%. In 2015, we repurchased 4.3 million shares (at an average of $45.72) and issued 2.1 million shares (at an average of $23.61).\nOur top priorities for use of cash are organic growth (via capital expenditures), dividends, and strategic acquisitions. After funding those priorities, if there is still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt or stockpile cash. We have been authorized by the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year, but we have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable.\nPART II\nCapitalization\nThis table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years.\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt outstanding:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Scheduled maturities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average interest rates (1)\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average maturities in years (1)\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit/commercial paper\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average interest rate\n</td> <td>.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt\n</td> <td>945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>689\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income taxes and other liabilities\n</td> <td>223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>1,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capitalization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused committed credit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>584\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total unused committed credit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>584\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current maturities of long-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>273\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of earnings to fixed charges (2)\n</td> <td>8.6 x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0 x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8 x\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________________\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>These rates include current maturities, but exclude commercial paper to reflect the averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities.

We repaid $200 million of 5.0% notes that matured in August 2015 and funded the payoff with a combination of cash and commercial paper.\nShort Term Borrowings\nWe can raise cash by issuing up to $600 million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a $600 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 12 lenders. This agreement expires in 2019. The credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit totaling up to $250 million. When we issue letters of credit in this manner, our capacity under the agreement, and consequently, our ability to issue commercial paper, is reduced by a corresponding amount. Amounts outstanding related to our commercial paper program were:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total program authorized\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper outstanding (classified as long-term debt)\n</td> <td>(181\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit issued under the credit agreement\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total program usage\n</td> <td>(181\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total program available\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>584\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe average and maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2015 was $136 million and $315 million, respectively. During the fourth quarter, the average and maximum amounts outstanding were $255 million and $289 million respectively. At year end, we had no letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement, but we had $64 million of stand-by letters of credit outside the agreement to take advantage of more attractive fee pricing.\nPART II\nWith operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, and our ability to issue debt in the capital markets, we believe we have sufficient funds available to repay maturing debt, as well as support our ongoing operations, pay dividends, fund future growth, and repurchase stock.\nOur revolving credit agreement and certain other long-term debt contain restrictive covenants, with which we were comfortably in compliance as of December 31, 2015. For more information, see Note J on page 91\nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAccessibility of Cash\nAt December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $253 million primarily invested in interest-bearing bank accounts and in bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.\nA substantial portion of these funds are held in the international accounts of our foreign operations. Though we do not rely on this foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs, we believe we could bring most of this cash back to the U.S. over a period of two to three years without material cost. However, due to capital requirements in various jurisdictions, approximately $90 million of this cash is currently inaccessible for repatriation. Additionally, if we had to bring all of the foreign cash back immediately in the form of dividends, we would incur incremental tax expense of up to approximately $107 million. In 2015, 2014, and 2013, we brought back cash of $112 million, $129 million, and $119 million, respectively, in each case at little to no added tax cost.\nPART II\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2015:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less\nThan 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More\nThan 5\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt \u00b9\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized leases\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations \u00b2\n</td> <td>296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments \u00b3\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income taxes\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other obligations (including pensions and net reserves for tax contingencies) 4\n</td> <td>189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>884\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.\n</td> <td>The long-term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.\n</td> <td>Purchase obligations primarily include open short-term (30-120 days) purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.\n</td> <td>Interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at December 31, 2015 at rates in effect at the end of the year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.\n</td> <td>Other obligations include our net reserves for tax contingencies in the \"More Than 5 Years\" column because these obligations are long-term in nature and actual payment dates can not be specifically determined.

To do so, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and disclosures. If we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change, and some of those changes could be significant. Our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management, at the time they are made, to be reasonable and appropriate. Estimates are adjusted for actual events, as they occur.\nCritical accounting estimates\u201d are those that are: a) subject to uncertainty and change, and b) of material impact to our financial statements. Listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements.\nWe provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72.\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Judgments and\nUncertainties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect if Actual Results\nDiffer From Assumptions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of June 30 and as triggering events occur.\nThe Steel Tubing unit met the held for sale criteria during the first quarter of 2015.

A non-cash charge of $108 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2014 for the complete write-off of the goodwill associated with this business.\nIn December 2013, we concluded that an impairment was required relating to the goodwill of the Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP) group. A non-cash charge of $63 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>In order to assess goodwill for potential impairment, judgment is required to estimate the fair market value of each reporting unit (which is one level below reportable segments) using the combination of a discounted cash flow model and a market approach using price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit.\nThe cash flow model contains uncertainties related to the forecast of future results as many outside economic and competitive factors can influence future performance. Margins, sales growth, and discount rates are the most critical estimates in determining enterprise values using the cash flow model.\nThe market approach requires judgment to determine the appropriate price to earnings ratio.

With the exception of 2014, our largest annual cost for litigation claims was $6 million for the five years ending December 31, 2015 (excluding legal fees).\nDuring 2014, we recorded expense of $92 million ($57 million for continuing operations and $35 million in discontinued operations) for various proceedings and other claims. By far the largest portion of these accruals was associated with a series of antitrust lawsuits involving the sale of polyurethane foam as discussed in Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 114. During 2015, we settled the substantial majority of these cases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPART II\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Judgments and\nUncertainties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect if Actual Results\nDiffer From Assumptions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In the ordinary course of business, we must make estimates of the tax treatment of many transactions, even though the ultimate tax outcome may remain uncertain for some time. These estimates become part of the annual income tax expense reported in our financial statements. Subsequent to year end, we finalize our tax analysis and file income tax returns. Tax authorities periodically audit these income tax returns and examine our tax filing positions, including (among other things) the timing and amounts of deductions, and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. If necessary, we adjust income tax expense in our financial statements in the periods in which the actual outcome becomes more certain.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures related to our various filing positions.\nOur effective tax rate is also impacted by changes in tax laws, the current mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, and the results of current tax audits and assessments.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $32 million and $34 million, respectively, of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related to net operating losses and other tax carryforwards. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount, source, and timing of future taxable income. In cases where we believe it is more likely than not that we may not realize the future potential tax benefits, we establish a valuation allowance against them. In addition, assumptions have been made regarding the non-repatriation of earnings from certain subsidiaries. Those assumptions may change in the future, thereby affecting future period results for the tax impact of possible repatriation.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Potential changes in tax laws could impact assumptions related to the non-repatriation of certain foreign earnings. If all non-repatriated earnings were taxed at current rates, we would incur additional taxes of approximately $107 million.\nAudits by various taxing authorities continue as governments look for ways to raise additional revenue. Based upon past audit experience, we do not expect any material changes to our tax liability as a result of this audit activity; however, we could incur additional tax expense if we have audit adjustments higher than recent historical experience.\nThe likelihood of recovery of net operating losses and other tax carryforwards has been closely evaluated and is based upon such factors as the time remaining before expiration, viable tax planning strategies, and future taxable earnings expectations. We believe that appropriate valuation allowances have been recorded as necessary. However, if earnings expectations or other assumptions change such that additional valuation allowances are required, we could incur additional tax expense. Likewise, if fewer valuation allowances are needed, we could incur reduced tax expense.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPART II\nLITIGATION CONTINGENCIES\nAccruals for Probable Losses\nAlthough the Company denies liability in all threatened or pending litigation proceedings in which it is or may be a party and believes that it has valid bases to contest all claims threatened or made against it, we have recorded a litigation contingency accrual for our reasonable estimate of probable loss for pending and threatened litigation proceedings, in aggregate, in millions, as follows:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation contingency accrual - Beginning of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment to accruals - expense - Continuing operations\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment to accruals - expense - Discontinued operations\n</td> <td>.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash payments\n</td> <td>(82.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation contingency accrual - End of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect to pay the majority of the accrual balance within the next year. The above litigation contingency accrual does not include accrued expenses related to workers' compensation, automobile, product and general liability claims, taxation issues and environmental matters, some of which may contain a portion of litigation expense. However, any litigation expense associated with these categories are not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operation, or cash flows. For more information regarding accrued expenses, see Footnote I - Supplemental Balance Sheet Information under \"Accrued expenses\" on page 90.\nWe have relied on several facts and circumstances to conclude that some loss is probable with respect to certain proceedings and matters, to arrive at a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss and record the accruals, including: the maturation of the pending proceedings and matters; our experience in settlement negotiations and mediation; comparative settlements of other companies in similar proceedings; discovery becoming substantially complete in certain proceedings; certain quantitative metrics used to value probable loss contingencies; and our willingness to settle certain proceedings to forgo the cost and risk of litigation and distraction to our senior executives.\nReasonably Possible Losses in Excess of Accruals\nBased upon current facts and circumstances, as of December 31, 2015, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable) losses in excess of the accruals noted above are estimated to be approximately $25 million. Although there are a number of uncertainties and potential outcomes associated with all of our pending or threatened litigation proceedings, we believe, based on current facts and circumstances, that additional losses, if any (other than approximately $14 million plus interest and attorney fees of approximately $2 million of reasonably possible losses associated with Brazilian VAT matters and approximately $9 million of reasonably possible losses primarily related to patent infringement, antitrust matters and other matters), are not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nFor more information regarding litigation contingencies, please refer to Note T on page 114 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nAs discussed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72, the FASB has issued accounting guidance effective for current and future periods.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n2015 HIGHLIGHTS\nEarnings from continuing operations increased significantly (versus 2014) reflecting several factors, including the benefit from higher sales, pricing discipline, and lower foam litigation expense.\nSales from continuing operations also grew in 2015, with higher unit volume and acquisitions partially offset by raw material-related price deflation and currency impact. Nearly all of our businesses experienced unit volume growth during the year, from a combination of new program awards, market share gains, and broadly improving end market demand.\nA major component of our strategy since 2007 has been the optimization of our portfolio of businesses, by increasing investment in businesses that possess strong competitive advantage and reducing our exposure to businesses and markets that are less attractive. In 2015, we made further progress on both fronts. During the year, we expanded our operations to support continued growth of our Automotive business, invested in machinery to support the growing demand for ComfortCore\u00ae innersprings, and added three new facilities to support growth in our Adjustable Bed business. We also acquired, in our Work Furniture business, a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial, and other settings. Additionally, in 2015, we completed the divestitures of several small operations including our Steel Tubing business, the two remaining Store Fixtures operations, and a small part of the Commercial Vehicle Products business.\nOperating cash decreased versus 2014 levels, primarily due to payments made to settle foam litigation. However, we once again generated more than enough cash from operations to comfortably fund dividends and capital expenditures, something we've accomplished for over 25 years.\n2015 marked the 44th consecutive annual dividend increase for the company, with a compound annual growth rate of 13% over that time period. Only one other S&P 500 company can claim as high a rate of dividend growth for as many years.\nOur financial profile remains strong. We ended 2015 with net debt to net capital comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30-40%. In August, we repaid $200 million of notes that matured. We ended the year with over $400 million available under our commercial paper program.\nWe assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return (TSR) to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis. We target TSR in the top third of the S&P 500 over the long term. For the three years ended December 31, 2015, we generated TSR of 20% per year on average. That placed us in the top third of the S&P 500, meeting our long-term goal.\nThese topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.\nPART II\nINTRODUCTION\nTotal Shareholder Return\nTotal Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance. TSR is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay [TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price]. We seek to achieve TSR in the top third of the S&P 500 over the long-term through a balanced approach that employs four TSR drivers: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.\nWe monitor our TSR performance (relative to the S&P 500) on a rolling three-year basis. For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2015, we met our top third TSR goal. We generated TSR of 20% per year on average over the last three years, well above the S&P 500's 15% annual TSR for that same time period.\nCustomers\nWe serve a broad suite of customers, with our largest customer representing approximately 8% of our sales. Many are companies whose names are widely recognized. They include most producers of residential furniture and bedding, auto and office seating manufacturers, and a variety of other companies.\nMajor Factors That Impact Our Business\nMany factors impact our business, but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand, raw material cost trends, and competition.\nMarket Demand\nMarket demand (including product mix) is impacted by several economic factors, with consumer confidence being most significant. Other important factors include disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, and interest rates. All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and therefore affect demand for our components and products. Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.\nRaw Material Costs\nIn many of our businesses, we enjoy a cost advantage from being vertically integrated into steel wire and rod. This is a benefit that our competitors do not have. We also experience favorable purchasing leverage from buying large quantities of raw materials. Still, our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials (many of which are commodities) fluctuate.\nWe typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market. Our ability to recover higher costs (through selling price increases) is crucial. When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs. Conversely, when costs decrease significantly, we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers. The timing of our price increases or decreases is important; we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs and we also realize a lag as costs decline, as was the case in the last half of 2015.\nSteel is our principal raw material. At various times in past years we have experienced significant cost fluctuations in this commodity. In most cases, the major changes (both increases and decreases) were passed through to customers with selling price adjustments. Throughout 2015, market prices for steel scrap, rod, and flat-rolled products decreased significantly, leading to downward pressure on selling prices. We realized a beneficial\nPART II\npricing lag during the year, as costs generally decreased at a faster rate than selling prices. Assuming that steel costs stabilize, we expect that 2015's pricing lag benefit will not recur in 2016.\nAs a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by changes in metal margins (the difference between the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod). Metal margins within the steel industry have been volatile during certain periods in recent years. In late 2013 and early 2014, metal margins decreased significantly as market conditions did not allow full recovery of higher scrap costs. An antidumping and countervailing duty case filed in January 2014 by major U.S. steel wire rod producers was concluded in December 2014, resulting in the implementation of duties on imports of Chinese steel wire rod. The antidumping duties range from 106% to 110% and the countervailing duties range from 178% to 193%. Both remain in effect through December 2019.\nOur other raw materials include woven and non-woven fabrics, foam scrap, and chemicals. We have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in recent years, and in most years, have been able to pass them through to our customers.\nWhen we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs, this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components. We must continue providing product options to our customers that enable them to improve the functionality and manage the cost of their products, while providing higher margin and profit contribution for our operations.\nCompetition\nMany of our markets are highly competitive, with the number of competitors varying by product line. In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies. Many of our competitors, both domestic and foreign, compete primarily on the basis of price. Our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive, while delivering better product quality, innovation, and customer service.\nWe continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities. However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.\nSince 2009, there have been antidumping duty orders on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%. In March 2014, the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that the duties should be continued. In April 2014, the DOC published its final order continuing the duties through February 2019 (for China) and December 2018 (for South Africa and Vietnam).\nBecause of the documented evasion of antidumping orders by certain importers, typically shipping goods through third countries and falsely identifying the countries of origin, Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers have formed a coalition and are working with members of Congress, the DOC, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders. As a result of these efforts, the U.S. Congress passed the Enforcing Orders and Reducing Customs Evasion (ENFORCE) Act. The ENFORCE Act requires CBP to implement a transparent, time-limited process to investigate allegations of duty evasion and to assess duties where appropriate.\nPART II\nSettlement of Polyurethane Foam Litigation\nWe previously disclosed that we were one of several defendants in a series of civil antitrust lawsuits involving the sale of polyurethane foam. During 2015, we settled the substantial majority of these cases. Although there are a few cases yet to be resolved, based upon current facts, we do not believe that the outcome of these remaining cases will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flow.\nAccrual for Loss Contingencies and Reasonably Possible Losses in Excess of Accruals\nAlthough we deny liability in all threatened or pending litigation proceedings and believe that we have valid bases to contest all claims made against us, we have an aggregate litigation contingency accrual of $8 million. The accrual amount decreased from the prior year primarily due to cash payments for litigation settlements of $82 million. Based upon current facts and circumstances, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable) losses in excess of the recorded accruals for litigation contingencies are estimated to be $25 million. These include Brazilian VAT, antitrust, patent, and other matters. For more information regarding litigation contingency accruals and reasonably possible losses in excess of accruals, see Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 114.\nLeggett's Claim for Alleged Antitrust Violations\nWe are also a plaintiff in an antitrust case against The Dow Chemical Company. We, along with other plaintiffs, have alleged that several defendants conspired to fix prices and allocate customers and markets for certain urethane chemical products. The trial is scheduled to begin on March 7, 2016. We believe that it is reasonably likely that we may recover material damages. However, because of uncertainties we cannot estimate the amount of recovery, and it is possible that we won't recover any damages at all. For more information regarding our antitrust litigation, see Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 114.\nDiscontinued Operations\nFor information regarding discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 76.\nGoodwill Impairment of Store Fixtures Group\nA significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. We review our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in June of each year, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review in June 2014, and on July 14, 2014, concluded that an impairment charge of $108 million ($93 million after tax) was required for our Store Fixtures group. This non-cash impairment charge reflected the complete write-off of the goodwill associated with the Store Fixtures group and was recognized in discontinued operations. For more information, see Note C to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.\nDivestiture of Store Fixtures Operations\nOn November 1, 2014, we sold the majority of the Store Fixtures business for $64 million. These divested operations represented approximately three-quarters of the business unit's revenues. The transaction resulted in an after-tax loss of $5 million, which was recognized in discontinued operations.\nThe two remaining Store Fixtures facilities were sold in 2015 and resulted in an after-tax gain of $3 million, which was also recognized in discontinued operations.\nPART II\nCommercial Vehicle Products Divestiture\nIn late 2015, we sold a small CVP operation that did not meet the discontinued operations criteria, leaving two remaining operations within that group. In February 2016, one of these operations reached held-for-sale status. Under a separate arrangement, we have agreed to sell real estate associated with the CVP unit and expect to realize a gain on this transaction. The real estate sale is subject to certain contingencies, which we anticipate will be resolved within the next twelve months. We will continue to explore strategic alternatives for the remaining CVP operation.\nChange in Segment Reporting\nOur reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure. Because of the divestiture of the majority of the Store Fixtures business in late 2014, along with the retirement of the Senior Operating Vice President of the Industrial Materials segment, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed in 2015.\nThe Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses were moved from Residential Furnishings to Commercial Products. The Aerospace business was moved from Industrial Materials to Specialized Products. The Spuhl machinery operation (which produces wire forming equipment primarily for our internal use) was moved from Specialized Products to Residential Furnishings. Additionally, our logistics operations, which primarily include intercompany transportation activity, were moved from Residential Furnishings to Industrial Materials. These segment changes were retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented.\nPART II\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS-2015 vs. 2014\nSales from continuing operations grew 4% in 2015, with higher unit volume and acquisitions partially offset by raw material-related price deflation and currency impact. Nearly all of our businesses experienced unit volume growth during the year, from a combination of new program awards, market share gains, and broadly improving end market demand.\nFull year earnings from continuing operations increased significantly reflecting several factors, including the benefit from higher sales, pricing discipline, and lower foam litigation expense. Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.\nConsolidated Results (continuing operations)\nThe following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from continuing operations during 2015, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.\n\nSame location sales (from continuing operations) grew 1%, with volume gains in Automotive, in most of our Residential Furnishings businesses, and in Adjustable Bed, largely offset by raw material-related price deflation and currency impact.\nFull-year 2015 sales growth also benefited from the July 2014 acquisition of Tempur Sealy's three innerspring component production facilities, the March 2015 acquisition of a Work Furniture business, and other smaller acquisitions. The divestiture of the Steel Tubing business occurred in late December, and did not significantly impact the full year sales comparison.\nEarnings from continuing operations increased significantly in 2015, primarily from higher sales and pricing discipline. As indicated in the table above, earnings also benefited from the reduction in foam litigation expense ($3 million in 2015 versus $33 million in 2014; further discussed on page 114). Partially offsetting these improvements was a one-time lump sum pension buyout funded from pension plan assets late in 2015.\nPART II\nLIFO Impact\nAll of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory. In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e., outside the segments) to convert about 50% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories. In 2014, steel costs were relatively stable and we ended the year with LIFO expense of $1 million. Significant deflation in steel costs during 2015 resulted in a full-year pretax LIFO benefit of $46 million.\nFor further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72.\nInterest and Income Taxes\nNet interest expense in 2015 increased slightly versus 2014.\nOur 2015 worldwide effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 27%, compared to 24% for 2014. The 2015 tax rate benefited from $11 million of favorable adjustments, including a reduction associated with changes to our permanent reinvestment assertions in China, and a tax benefit associated with our Australian operations. The 2014 tax rate includes $14 million of favorable adjustments primarily related to additional Domestic Production Activities Deduction tax benefits for the current and prior years, incremental deferred foreign tax credits, and net favorable adjustments related to prior year tax return filings. These adjustments benefited our 2014 rate more favorably due to lower pretax income.\nPART II\nSegment Results (continuing operations)\nIn the following section we discuss 2015 sales and EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) from continuing operations for each of our segments. We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84. Prior year segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the change in segment structure discussed on page 31.\n\n______________________________\n (1) This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures. These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier. \n (2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales. Overall company margin is calculated on external sales. \nResidential Furnishings\nResidential Furnishings sales increased 5% in 2015, with unit volume growth in most product categories and acquisitions partially offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact. Volume grew in Bedding, Home Furniture, Geo Components, and Fabric Converting. Within our U.S. Spring business, we again experienced significant growth in ComfortCore\u00ae (our pocketed coil innerspring), with unit volume in that product category up 51%. We expect strong growth in this category to continue from our introduction of new ComfortCore\u00ae products and our customers' growing use of these components in their product lines.\nEBIT and EBIT margin increased in 2015 due to higher sales, pricing discipline, and significantly lower foam litigation expense ($48 million).\nPART II\nCommercial Products\nSales in Commercial Products increased 21% in 2015, with same location sales up 12%. Continued strong demand in the Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses drove this improvement. Unit volume in the Adjustable Bed business increased 51% from a combination of new programs and strength in ongoing customer programs. Acquisitions also contributed 9% to the segment's sales growth during the year. In our Work Furniture business, we acquired a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial, and other settings.\nEBIT and EBIT margin increased in 2015, primarily from higher sales and improved operating efficiency.\nIndustrial Materials\nSales in the segment decreased 4% in 2015, with higher unit volume in Drawn Wire more than offset by steel-related price decreases and reduced rod mill trade sales.\nEBIT and EBIT margin improved versus 2014, with cost reductions more than offsetting $6 million of impairment charges and a $3 million loss on divestiture, both of which related to our Steel Tubing business.\nSpecialized Products\nIn Specialized Products, sales increased 4% in 2015, with volume gains in Automotive and Machinery partially offset by currency impact. Our Automotive business continued to experience strong growth from a combination of factors, including expanded component content (via upgraded features), participation in new vehicle platforms, and continued industry growth in each of the major markets.\nEBIT and EBIT margin increased primarily from higher sales.\nResults from Discontinued Operations\nFull year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased to $1 million from a loss of $124 million in 2014. This significant increase is primarily due to the non-recurrence of an impairment charge of $93 million related to the goodwill of the Store Fixtures business discussed on page 80, and foam litigation accruals of $22 million discussed on page 114. The divestiture of the majority of that business late in 2014 resulted in an additional loss of $5 million. For further information about discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 76.\nPART II\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS-2014 vs. 2013\nSales from continuing operations grew 9% in 2014 from a combination of strong organic growth in many of our major businesses and acquisitions. Earnings from continuing operations increased in 2014, largely due to sales growth. Other items in 2013 and 2014 essentially offset.\nFurther details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.\nConsolidated Results (continuing operations)\nThe following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from continuing operations during 2014, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.\n\nSame location sales (from continuing operations) grew 6%, reflecting strong volume gains in Automotive and in most of the company's Residential Furnishings businesses. These improvements were partially offset by weak demand in Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP).\nSales growth in 2014 also benefited from the acquisition of Tempur Sealy's three innerspring component production facilities and other smaller acquisitions. In conjunction with the purchase of the facilities from Tempur Sealy, we expanded and extended our supply relationship and became the exclusive long-term provider in the U.S. and Canada of wire-based innersprings for Tempur Sealy and boxsprings for Sealy.\nEarnings from continuing operations increased in 2014, with several items contributing to the year-over-year comparison. Operationally, earnings growth resulted primarily from higher sales, however this benefit was partially offset by higher stock compensation expense that resulted in large part from the significant increase in Leggett & Platt share price versus the market in late 2014. Reduced metal margins in our steel rod and wire operations and weather-related costs and inefficiencies early in the year also offset some of the earnings benefit from higher sales.\nAs indicated in the table above, a few additional items impacted the year-over-year earnings comparison. In 2013, earnings from continuing operations reflected non-cash impairment and other charges related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of our CVP business, and a bargain purchase gain related to the acquisition of an\nPART II\naerospace tubing business. Earnings from continuing operations in 2014 were negatively impacted by litigation accruals, which primarily related to the foam antitrust cases discussed on page 114.\nLIFO Impact\nAll of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory. In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e., outside the segments) to convert about 50% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories. Steel inflation in late 2013 resulted in full-year LIFO expense of $4 million. In 2014, steel costs were relatively stable and we ended the year with LIFO expense of $1 million.\nFor further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72.\nInterest and Income Taxes\nNet interest expense in 2014 decreased slightly versus 2013.\nOur 2014 worldwide effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 24%, compared to 22% for 2013. The 2014 tax rate benefited from $14 million of favorable adjustments, including additional Domestic Production Activities Deduction tax benefits for the current and prior years, incremental deferred foreign tax credits, and net favorable adjustments related to prior year tax return filings. The 2013 tax rate includes $17 million of favorable adjustments primarily related to the impact of Mexico tax law changes, the settlement of certain foreign and state tax audits, and a non-taxable bargain purchase gain.\nPART II\nSegment Results (continuing operations)\nIn the following section we discuss 2014 sales and EBIT from continuing operations for each of our segments. We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84. All segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the change in segment structure discussed on page 31.\n\n______________________________\n (1) This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures. These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier. \n (2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales. Overall company margin is calculated on external sales. \nResidential Furnishings\nResidential Furnishings sales increased 14% in 2014, from unit volume growth in most product categories and acquisitions (including the purchase of the three Tempur Sealy innerspring production facilities). Volume grew in Bedding, Home Furniture, Geo Components, Fabric Converting, and Carpet Cushion, from a combination of market share gains and broadly improving market demand in the second half of the year. Within our U.S. Spring business, we experienced significant growth in ComfortCore\u00ae (our pocketed coil innerspring), with unit volume in that product category up 52%. Mattress producers continued to integrate these higher-valued innersprings into more of their product lines, in many cases replacing lower-valued innersprings. In our Furniture Hardware business, unit volume increased 10% as consumer demand for reclining chairs and sofas continued to grow.\nEBIT and EBIT margin decreased in 2014, with the benefit from higher sales more than offset by a $54 million accrual related to the foam litigation discussed on page 114, and higher stock compensation expense.\nPART II\nCommercial Products\nSales in Commercial Products increased 10% in 2014. Demand was extremely strong in our Adjustable Bed business, with unit volume increasing 56% from a combination of new programs and strength in ongoing customer programs. We also benefited from market share gains and improved market demand in our Work Furniture business.\nEBIT improved slightly and EBIT margin was flat in 2014, with the benefit from higher sales partially offset by operational challenges with a Chinese joint venture.\nIndustrial Materials\nSales in the segment increased 3% in 2014. Growth in logistics services (primarily with other Leggett operations) was partially offset by reduced trade sales from our rod mill and lower wire volume.\nEBIT and EBIT margin declined versus 2013, primarily due to reduced metal margin in our steel rod and wire operations, and weather-related costs and inefficiencies early in 2014.\nSpecialized Products\nIn Specialized Products, sales increased 12% in 2014. Same location sales were up 8% and Aerospace acquisitions completed in 2013 also contributed to the full-year sales growth. Our Automotive business continued to experience strong growth, with sales up 17% from a combination of factors, including expanded component content (via upgraded features), participation in new vehicle platforms, and demand strength in each of the major markets. Partially offsetting this growth, CVP sales declined 21%, reflecting delayed vehicle replacement by major fleet operators and a change in an OEM incentive program. Machinery sales increased modestly for the year.\nEBIT and EBIT margin increased due to higher sales and the non-recurrence of impairment and other charges (of $67 million) related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of our CVP business that were recognized in 2013.\nResults from Discontinued Operations\nFull year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased to a loss of $124 million in 2014 (versus earnings of $13 million in 2013). This significant decline is primarily due to an impairment charge of $93 million related to the goodwill of the Store Fixtures business discussed on page 80, and foam litigation accruals of $22 million discussed on page 114. The divestiture of the majority of that business late in 2014 resulted in an additional loss of $5 million. Earnings in 2013 reflected an $8 million tax benefit attributable to another small operation. For further information about discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 76.\nPART II\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITALIZATION\nOur operations provide most of the cash we require, and debt may also be used to fund a portion of our needs. Cash from operations was once again strong in 2015. For over 25 years, our operations have provided more than enough cash to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments. We expect this to again be the case in 2016.\nCapital expenditures increased in 2015 from investments to support growth in Automotive, U.S. Spring, and Adjustable Bed. We increased the quarterly dividend and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 44 years. We also bought back 4.3 million shares of our stock during the year.\nIn August 2015, we repaid $200 million of 5.0% notes that matured. We ended 2015 with over $400 million of our commercial paper program available. Net debt to net capital at year end was 34.5%, within our long-standing targeted range of 30-40%. The calculation of net debt as a percent of net capital is presented on page 47.\nCash from Operations\nCash from operations is our primary source of funds. Earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations.\nCash from operations decreased in 2015. Though earnings increased during the year, the benefit to operating cash flow was more than offset by foam litigation payments totaling $82 million. The decrease in 2014 (versus 2013) was primarily from higher accounts receivable associated with increased sales volume late in that year.\nWith the foam litigation settlements largely complete, we expect cash from operations to approximate $450 million in 2016.\nPART II\nWe continue to closely monitor our working capital levels, and ended 2015 with adjusted working capital at 9.5% of annualized sales1. The table below explains this non-GAAP calculation. We eliminate cash and current debt maturities from working capital to monitor our performance related to operating efficiency and believe this provides a more useful measurement. The increase in adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized sales in 2015 primarily reflects decreased litigation accruals from payments made during the year.\n\n___________________________________________\n 1. Annualized sales equal 4th quarter sales ($945 million in 2015 and $953 million in 2014) multiplied by 4. We believe measuring our working capital against this sales metric is more useful, since efficient management of working capital includes adjusting those net asset levels to reflect current business volume. \nThree primary components of our working capital are discussed below.\nTrade Receivables - The payment trends by our major customers remained stable in 2015, with slight improvements in full year bad debt expense compared to 2014 levels. We continue to look for ways to improve payment patterns of customers and offer programs with incentives for early payment offered in conjunction with third parties when appropriate. Trade Receivables decreased slightly in 2015, primarily due to price deflation and currency translation impacts.\nTotal Inventories - The physical flow of materials through our production facilities is materially the same as in prior periods, and we are not experiencing a buildup of inventory. Expense associated with slow moving and obsolete inventories in 2015 was generally in line with that of 2014. Further, we review usage and inventory quantities at the part number level to determine if current inventory amounts are recoverable by future demand, and reserve necessary amounts on a timely basis.\nFIFO Inventory decreased in 2015 primarily due to significant steel-related price deflation and currency fluctuations. These decreases were partially offset by the timing of certain customer orders late in the year, opportunistic purchases of raw materials, and continued sales growth (which requires additional inventory for support).\nThe increase in our fourth quarter DIO is directly related to the effects of the LIFO method of accounting for inventories and the significant deflation in steel prices during 2015. Under LIFO accounting, the most recent raw material purchases are assumed to be the first consumed in production. Significant steel price deflation resulted in a significant decrease in our LIFO reserves, particularly in the fourth quarter, making comparability to prior quarter's DIO difficult.\nAccounts Payable - Our payment terms are materially consistent with our past practices. We strive to optimize payment terms with our vendors and third parties that allow flexible payment options. Our accounts payable balance decreased at December 31, 2015 vs. 2014 primarily due to steel deflation (that led to lower cost of raw material purchases), currency fluctuations, and timing of payments for inventory purchases. Steel deflation (which was particularly sharp in the fourth quarter), also drove a decrease in our fourth quarter 2015 DPO.\nPART II\nThe following table presents dollar amounts of key working capital components at the end of the past two years.\n\nThe next chart shows recent trends in key working capital components (expressed in numbers of days at the end of the past five quarters).\n 1. The inventory ratio represents days of inventory on hand calculated as: ending net inventory \u00f7 (quarterly cost of goods sold \u00f7 number of days in the quarter). \n 2. The trade receivables ratio represents the days of sales outstanding calculated as: ending net trade receivables \u00f7 (quarterly net sales \u00f7 number of days in the quarter). \n 3. The accounts payable ratio represents the days of payables outstanding calculated as: ending accounts payable \u00f7 (quarterly cost of goods sold \u00f7 number of days in the quarter). \nPART II\nUses of Cash\nFinance Capital Requirements\nCash is readily available to fund selective growth, both internally (through capital expenditures) and externally (through acquisitions).\nIn certain of our businesses and product lines we have minimal excess capacity, and we are investing to support continued growth. In Automotive, we are expanding capacity to support new programs that will begin production in 2016 and later years. In Bedding, we are investing in equipment (that we build in our own Swiss operation) to support ongoing growth in ComfortCore\u00ae innersprings. In Adjustable Bed, which operated a single large location until 2015, we have added new locations to broaden our geographic scope and now operate four facilities in North America.\nIn many of our other businesses, we have available capacity to accommodate additional volume. For each additional $100 million of sales from incremental unit volume produced utilizing spare capacity, we expect to generate approximately $25 million to $35 million of additional pre-tax earnings. With market share gains and higher market demand, our capacity utilization has increased. The earnings and margin improvement that we have realized over the past few years reflects, in part, that higher utilization.\nWe will continue to make investments to support growth in businesses and product lines where sales are strong, and for efficiency improvement and maintenance. We expect capital expenditures to approximate $130 million in 2016. Our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital. This emphasis heightens the focus on asset utilization and helps ensure that we are investing additional capital dollars where attractive return potential exists.\nOur strategic, long-term, 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions. We are seeking acquisitions primarily within our business units that have been designated as Grow businesses, and are looking for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).\nIn 2013, we acquired two small businesses that supply tubing and tubing sub-assemblies to the aerospace market.\nPART II\nIn 2014, we purchased the three Tempur Sealy U.S. innerspring component production facilities for $45 million. We also acquired a German designer and distributor of high-end, European-styled motion components for residential furniture.\nIn 2015, we acquired a 70% interest in a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial, and other settings for $23 million. This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally.\nAdditional details about these and other smaller acquisitions can be found in Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 109.\nPay Dividends\nIncreasing the dividend remains a high priority. In 2015, we increased the quarterly dividend to $.32 per share and extended our record of consecutive annual dividend increases to 44 years, at an average compound growth rate of 13%. Our targeted dividend payout ratio is approximately 50-60% of net earnings, however the actual payout has been higher in recent years. As a result, dividend growth in recent years has been modest, at about 3% per year. With significant earnings improvement in 2015, the dividend payout ratio for the year was within the target range. This should allow us flexibility to consider future dividend growth that more closely aligns with earnings growth.\nDuring 2012, we declared four quarterly dividends, but paid five, given our decision to accelerate into December 2012 the dividend typically paid in January 2013 (of $41 million) in anticipation of tax rate increases on individual taxpayers. In 2013, we returned to our prior practice and paid the fourth quarter dividend in January 2014. Therefore, the cash requirement for dividends in 2013 was lower, at $125 million.\nPART II\nRepurchase Stock\nAs shown in the chart above, share repurchases were significant in each of the last three years. During that time frame, we repurchased a total of 15.6 million shares of our stock and issued 9.1 million shares (through employee benefit plans and stock option exercises), reducing outstanding shares by 5%. In 2015, we repurchased 4.3 million shares (at an average of $45.72) and issued 2.1 million shares (at an average of $23.61).\nOur top priorities for use of cash are organic growth (via capital expenditures), dividends, and strategic acquisitions. After funding those priorities, if there is still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt or stockpile cash. We have been authorized by the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year, but we have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable.\nPART II\nCapitalization\nThis table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years.\n\n___________________________________________\n (1) These rates include current maturities, but exclude commercial paper to reflect the averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities. The rates also include amortization of interest rate swaps. \n (2) Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest, plus implied interest included in operating leases. Earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed charges. \nPART II\nThe next table shows the percent of long-term debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2015 and 2014, calculated in two ways:\n \u2022 Long-term debt and total capitalization as reported in the previous table. \n \u2022 Long-term debt and total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long-term debt. \nWe believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more useful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly. We use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage.\n\nTotal debt (which includes long-term debt and current debt maturities) decreased $21 million in 2015. We repaid $200 million of 5.0% notes that matured in August 2015 and funded the payoff with a combination of cash and commercial paper.\nShort Term Borrowings\nWe can raise cash by issuing up to $600 million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a $600 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 12 lenders. This agreement expires in 2019. The credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit totaling up to $250 million. When we issue letters of credit in this manner, our capacity under the agreement, and consequently, our ability to issue commercial paper, is reduced by a corresponding amount. Amounts outstanding related to our commercial paper program were:\n\nThe average and maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2015 was $136 million and $315 million, respectively. During the fourth quarter, the average and maximum amounts outstanding were $255 million and $289 million respectively. At year end, we had no letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement, but we had $64 million of stand-by letters of credit outside the agreement to take advantage of more attractive fee pricing.\nPART II\nWith operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, and our ability to issue debt in the capital markets, we believe we have sufficient funds available to repay maturing debt, as well as support our ongoing operations, pay dividends, fund future growth, and repurchase stock.\nOur revolving credit agreement and certain other long-term debt contain restrictive covenants, with which we were comfortably in compliance as of December 31, 2015. For more information, see Note J on page 91\nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAccessibility of Cash\nAt December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $253 million primarily invested in interest-bearing bank accounts and in bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.\nA substantial portion of these funds are held in the international accounts of our foreign operations. Though we do not rely on this foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs, we believe we could bring most of this cash back to the U.S. over a period of two to three years without material cost. However, due to capital requirements in various jurisdictions, approximately $90 million of this cash is currently inaccessible for repatriation. Additionally, if we had to bring all of the foreign cash back immediately in the form of dividends, we would incur incremental tax expense of up to approximately $107 million. In 2015, 2014, and 2013, we brought back cash of $112 million, $129 million, and $119 million, respectively, in each case at little to no added tax cost.\nPART II\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2015:\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n 1. The long-term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due. \n 2. Purchase obligations primarily include open short-term (30-120 days) purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities. \n 3. Interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at December 31, 2015 at rates in effect at the end of the year. \n 4. Other obligations include our net reserves for tax contingencies in the \"More Than 5 Years\" column because these obligations are long-term in nature and actual payment dates can not be specifically determined. Other obligations also include our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension plans. \nPART II\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. To do so, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and disclosures. If we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change, and some of those changes could be significant. Our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management, at the time they are made, to be reasonable and appropriate. Estimates are adjusted for actual events, as they occur.\nCritical accounting estimates\u201d are those that are: a) subject to uncertainty and change, and b) of material impact to our financial statements. Listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements.\nWe provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72.\n Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Goodwill Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of June 30 and as triggering events occur. The Steel Tubing unit met the held for sale criteria during the first quarter of 2015. Because fair value less cost to sell had fallen below recorded book value, we fully impaired this unit's goodwill and incurred a non-cash charge of $4 million in the first quarter of 2015. In July 2014, we concluded that an impairment was required related to the goodwill of the Store Fixtures group, which was formerly part of the Commercial Products segment and is now reported in discontinued operations. A non-cash charge of $108 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2014 for the complete write-off of the goodwill associated with this business. In December 2013, we concluded that an impairment was required relating to the goodwill of the Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP) group. A non-cash charge of $63 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013. In order to assess goodwill for potential impairment, judgment is required to estimate the fair market value of each reporting unit (which is one level below reportable segments) using the combination of a discounted cash flow model and a market approach using price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. The cash flow model contains uncertainties related to the forecast of future results as many outside economic and competitive factors can influence future performance. Margins, sales growth, and discount rates are the most critical estimates in determining enterprise values using the cash flow model. The market approach requires judgment to determine the appropriate price to earnings ratio. Ratios are derived from comparable publicly-traded companies that operate in the same or similar industry as the reporting unit. The second quarter 2015 goodwill impairment review indicated no impairments, with all reporting units having fair values that exceed carrying value by more than 50%. We have $806 million of goodwill at December 31, 2015, including $12 million associated with the CVP reporting unit. As discussed in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79, we continue to explore strategic alternatives for this reporting unit. If we are not able to meet projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible. Information regarding material assumptions used to determine if a goodwill impairment exists can be found in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79. \nPART II\n Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Other Long-lived Assets Other long-lived assets are tested for recoverability at year-end and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other long-lived assets we estimate fair value at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured (usually at a branch level). Impairments of other long-lived assets usually occur when major restructuring activities take place, or we decide to discontinue product lines completely. Our impairment assessments have uncertainties because they require estimates of future cash flows to determine if undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover carrying values of these assets. For assets where future cash flows are not expected to recover carrying value, fair value is estimated which requires an estimate of market value based upon asset appraisals for like assets. These impairments are unpredictable. Impairments were $2 million in 2015, $1 million in 2014 and $2 million in 2013. Inventory Reserves We reduce the carrying value of inventories to reflect an estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving inventory. We value inventory at net realizable value (what we think we will recover). Generally a reserve is not required unless we have more than a one-year's supply of the product. If we have had no sales of a given product for 12 months, those items are generally deemed to have no value and are written down completely. Our inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow-moving (i.e., not selling very quickly). Changes in customer behavior and requirements can cause inventory to quickly become obsolete or slow moving. The calculation also uses an estimate of the ultimate recoverability of items identified as slow moving based upon historical experience (65% on average). At December 31, 2015, the reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventory was $33 million (approximately 6% of FIFO inventories). This is consistent with the December 31, 2014 and 2013 reserves of $30 million and $36", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n2015 HIGHLIGHTS\nEarnings from continuing operations increased significantly (versus 2014) reflecting several factors, including the benefit from higher sales, pricing discipline, and lower foam litigation expense.\nSales from continuing operations also grew in 2015, with higher unit volume and acquisitions partially offset by raw material-related price deflation and currency impact. Nearly all of our businesses experienced unit volume growth during the year, from a combination of new program awards, market share gains, and broadly improving end market demand.\nA major component of our strategy since 2007 has been the optimization of our portfolio of businesses, by increasing investment in businesses that possess strong competitive advantage and reducing our exposure to businesses and markets that are less attractive. In 2015, we made further progress on both fronts. During the year, we expanded our operations to support continued growth of our Automotive business, invested in machinery to support the growing demand for ComfortCore\u00ae innersprings, and added three new facilities to support growth in our Adjustable Bed business. We also acquired, in our Work Furniture business, a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial, and other settings. Additionally, in 2015, we completed the divestitures of several small operations including our Steel Tubing business, the two remaining Store Fixtures operations, and a small part of the Commercial Vehicle Products business.\nOperating cash decreased versus 2014 levels, primarily due to payments made to settle foam litigation. However, we once again generated more than enough cash from operations to comfortably fund dividends and capital expenditures, something we've accomplished for over 25 years.\n2015 marked the 44th consecutive annual dividend increase for the company, with a compound annual growth rate of 13% over that time period. Only one other S&P 500 company can claim as high a rate of dividend growth for as many years.\nOur financial profile remains strong. We ended 2015 with net debt to net capital comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30-40%. In August, we repaid $200 million of notes that matured. We ended the year with over $400 million available under our commercial paper program.\nWe assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return (TSR) to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis. We target TSR in the top third of the S&P 500 over the long term. For the three years ended December 31, 2015, we generated TSR of 20% per year on average. That placed us in the top third of the S&P 500, meeting our long-term goal.\nThese topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.\nPART II\nINTRODUCTION\nTotal Shareholder Return\nTotal Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance. TSR is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay [TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price]. We seek to achieve TSR in the top third of the S&P 500 over the long-term through a balanced approach that employs four TSR drivers: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.\nWe monitor our TSR performance (relative to the S&P 500) on a rolling three-year basis. For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2015, we met our top third TSR goal. We generated TSR of 20% per year on average over the last three years, well above the S&P 500's 15% annual TSR for that same time period.\nCustomers\nWe serve a broad suite of customers, with our largest customer representing approximately 8% of our sales. Many are companies whose names are widely recognized. They include most producers of residential furniture and bedding, auto and office seating manufacturers, and a variety of other companies.\nMajor Factors That Impact Our Business\nMany factors impact our business, but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand, raw material cost trends, and competition.\nMarket Demand\nMarket demand (including product mix) is impacted by several economic factors, with consumer confidence being most significant. Other important factors include disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, and interest rates. All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and therefore affect demand for our components and products. Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.\nRaw Material Costs\nIn many of our businesses, we enjoy a cost advantage from being vertically integrated into steel wire and rod. This is a benefit that our competitors do not have. We also experience favorable purchasing leverage from buying large quantities of raw materials. Still, our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials (many of which are commodities) fluctuate.\nWe typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market. Our ability to recover higher costs (through selling price increases) is crucial. When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs. Conversely, when costs decrease significantly, we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers. The timing of our price increases or decreases is important; we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs and we also realize a lag as costs decline, as was the case in the last half of 2015.\nSteel is our principal raw material. At various times in past years we have experienced significant cost fluctuations in this commodity. In most cases, the major changes (both increases and decreases) were passed through to customers with selling price adjustments. Throughout 2015, market prices for steel scrap, rod, and flat-rolled products decreased significantly, leading to downward pressure on selling prices. We realized a beneficial\nPART II\npricing lag during the year, as costs generally decreased at a faster rate than selling prices. Assuming that steel costs stabilize, we expect that 2015's pricing lag benefit will not recur in 2016.\nAs a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by changes in metal margins (the difference between the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod). Metal margins within the steel industry have been volatile during certain periods in recent years. In late 2013 and early 2014, metal margins decreased significantly as market conditions did not allow full recovery of higher scrap costs. An antidumping and countervailing duty case filed in January 2014 by major U.S. steel wire rod producers was concluded in December 2014, resulting in the implementation of duties on imports of Chinese steel wire rod. The antidumping duties range from 106% to 110% and the countervailing duties range from 178% to 193%. Both remain in effect through December 2019.\nOur other raw materials include woven and non-woven fabrics, foam scrap, and chemicals. We have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in recent years, and in most years, have been able to pass them through to our customers.\nWhen we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs, this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components. We must continue providing product options to our customers that enable them to improve the functionality and manage the cost of their products, while providing higher margin and profit contribution for our operations.\nCompetition\nMany of our markets are highly competitive, with the number of competitors varying by product line. In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies. Many of our competitors, both domestic and foreign, compete primarily on the basis of price. Our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive, while delivering better product quality, innovation, and customer service.\nWe continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities. However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.\nSince 2009, there have been antidumping duty orders on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%. In March 2014, the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that the duties should be continued. In April 2014, the DOC published its final order continuing the duties through February 2019 (for China) and December 2018 (for South Africa and Vietnam).\nBecause of the documented evasion of antidumping orders by certain importers, typically shipping goods through third countries and falsely identifying the countries of origin, Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers have formed a coalition and are working with members of Congress, the DOC, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders. As a result of these efforts, the U.S. Congress passed the Enforcing Orders and Reducing Customs Evasion (ENFORCE) Act. The ENFORCE Act requires CBP to implement a transparent, time-limited process to investigate allegations of duty evasion and to assess duties where appropriate.\nPART II\nSettlement of Polyurethane Foam Litigation\nWe previously disclosed that we were one of several defendants in a series of civil antitrust lawsuits involving the sale of polyurethane foam. During 2015, we settled the substantial majority of these cases. Although there are a few cases yet to be resolved, based upon current facts, we do not believe that the outcome of these remaining cases will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flow.\nAccrual for Loss Contingencies and Reasonably Possible Losses in Excess of Accruals\nAlthough we deny liability in all threatened or pending litigation proceedings and believe that we have valid bases to contest all claims made against us, we have an aggregate litigation contingency accrual of $8 million. The accrual amount decreased from the prior year primarily due to cash payments for litigation settlements of $82 million. Based upon current facts and circumstances, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable) losses in excess of the recorded accruals for litigation contingencies are estimated to be $25 million. These include Brazilian VAT, antitrust, patent, and other matters. For more information regarding litigation contingency accruals and reasonably possible losses in excess of accruals, see Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 114.\nLeggett's Claim for Alleged Antitrust Violations\nWe are also a plaintiff in an antitrust case against The Dow Chemical Company. We, along with other plaintiffs, have alleged that several defendants conspired to fix prices and allocate customers and markets for certain urethane chemical products. The trial is scheduled to begin on March 7, 2016. We believe that it is reasonably likely that we may recover material damages. However, because of uncertainties we cannot estimate the amount of recovery, and it is possible that we won't recover any damages at all. For more information regarding our antitrust litigation, see Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 114.\nDiscontinued Operations\nFor information regarding discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 76.\nGoodwill Impairment of Store Fixtures Group\nA significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. We review our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in June of each year, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review in June 2014, and on July 14, 2014, concluded that an impairment charge of $108 million ($93 million after tax) was required for our Store Fixtures group. This non-cash impairment charge reflected the complete write-off of the goodwill associated with the Store Fixtures group and was recognized in discontinued operations. For more information, see Note C to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.\nDivestiture of Store Fixtures Operations\nOn November 1, 2014, we sold the majority of the Store Fixtures business for $64 million. These divested operations represented approximately three-quarters of the business unit's revenues. The transaction resulted in an after-tax loss of $5 million, which was recognized in discontinued operations.\nThe two remaining Store Fixtures facilities were sold in 2015 and resulted in an after-tax gain of $3 million, which was also recognized in discontinued operations.\nPART II\nCommercial Vehicle Products Divestiture\nIn late 2015, we sold a small CVP operation that did not meet the discontinued operations criteria, leaving two remaining operations within that group. In February 2016, one of these operations reached held-for-sale status. Under a separate arrangement, we have agreed to sell real estate associated with the CVP unit and expect to realize a gain on this transaction. The real estate sale is subject to certain contingencies, which we anticipate will be resolved within the next twelve months. We will continue to explore strategic alternatives for the remaining CVP operation.\nChange in Segment Reporting\nOur reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure. Because of the divestiture of the majority of the Store Fixtures business in late 2014, along with the retirement of the Senior Operating Vice President of the Industrial Materials segment, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed in 2015.\nThe Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses were moved from Residential Furnishings to Commercial Products. The Aerospace business was moved from Industrial Materials to Specialized Products. The Spuhl machinery operation (which produces wire forming equipment primarily for our internal use) was moved from Specialized Products to Residential Furnishings. Additionally, our logistics operations, which primarily include intercompany transportation activity, were moved from Residential Furnishings to Industrial Materials. These segment changes were retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented.\nPART II\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS-2015 vs. 2014\nSales from continuing operations grew 4% in 2015, with higher unit volume and acquisitions partially offset by raw material-related price deflation and currency impact. Nearly all of our businesses experienced unit volume growth during the year, from a combination of new program awards, market share gains, and broadly improving end market demand.\nFull year earnings from continuing operations increased significantly reflecting several factors, including the benefit from higher sales, pricing discipline, and lower foam litigation expense. Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.\nConsolidated Results (continuing operations)\nThe following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from continuing operations during 2015, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales (continuing operations):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Approximate volume gains\n</td> <td>196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Approximate raw material-related deflation and currency impact\n</td> <td>(183\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same location sales\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition sales growth\n</td> <td>123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Divestitures\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from continuing operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts, net of tax)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lower foam litigation expense\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lump sum pension buyout\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, including benefit from higher sales and pricing discipline\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings Per Diluted Share (continuing operations)-2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings Per Diluted Share (continuing operations)-2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSame location sales (from continuing operations) grew 1%, with volume gains in Automotive, in most of our Residential Furnishings businesses, and in Adjustable Bed, largely offset by raw material-related price deflation and currency impact.\nFull-year 2015 sales growth also benefited from the July 2014 acquisition of Tempur Sealy's three innerspring component production facilities, the March 2015 acquisition of a Work Furniture business, and other smaller acquisitions. The divestiture of the Steel Tubing business occurred in late December, and did not significantly impact the full year sales comparison.\nEarnings from continuing operations increased significantly in 2015, primarily from higher sales and pricing discipline. As indicated in the table above, earnings also benefited from the reduction in foam litigation expense ($3 million in 2015 versus $33 million in 2014; further discussed on page 114). Partially offsetting these improvements was a one-time lump sum pension buyout funded from pension plan assets late in 2015.\nPART II\nLIFO Impact\nAll of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory. In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e., outside the segments) to convert about 50% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories. In 2014, steel costs were relatively stable and we ended the year with LIFO expense of $1 million. Significant deflation in steel costs during 2015 resulted in a full-year pretax LIFO benefit of $46 million.\nFor further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72.\nInterest and Income Taxes\nNet interest expense in 2015 increased slightly versus 2014.\nOur 2015 worldwide effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 27%, compared to 24% for 2014. The 2015 tax rate benefited from $11 million of favorable adjustments, including a reduction associated with changes to our permanent reinvestment assertions in China, and a tax benefit associated with our Australian operations. The 2014 tax rate includes $14 million of favorable adjustments primarily related to additional Domestic Production Activities Deduction tax benefits for the current and prior years, incremental deferred foreign tax credits, and net favorable adjustments related to prior year tax return filings. These adjustments benefited our 2014 rate more favorably due to lower pretax income.\nPART II\nSegment Results (continuing operations)\nIn the following section we discuss 2015 sales and EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) from continuing operations for each of our segments. We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84. Prior year segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the change in segment structure discussed on page 31.\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

</tr>\n</table>\n______________________________\n (1) This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures. These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier. \n (2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales. Overall company margin is calculated on external sales. \nResidential Furnishings\nResidential Furnishings sales increased 5% in 2015, with unit volume growth in most product categories and acquisitions partially offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact. Volume grew in Bedding, Home Furniture, Geo Components, and Fabric Converting. Within our U.S. Spring business, we again experienced significant growth in ComfortCore\u00ae (our pocketed coil innerspring), with unit volume in that product category up 51%. We expect strong growth in this category to continue from our introduction of new ComfortCore\u00ae products and our customers' growing use of these components in their product lines.\nEBIT and EBIT margin increased in 2015 due to higher sales, pricing discipline, and significantly lower foam litigation expense ($48 million).\nPART II\nCommercial Products\nSales in Commercial Products increased 21% in 2015, with same location sales up 12%. Continued strong demand in the Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses drove this improvement. Unit volume in the Adjustable Bed business increased 51% from a combination of new programs and strength in ongoing customer programs. Acquisitions also contributed 9% to the segment's sales growth during the year. In our Work Furniture business, we acquired a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial, and other settings.\nEBIT and EBIT margin increased in 2015, primarily from higher sales and improved operating efficiency.\nIndustrial Materials\nSales in the segment decreased 4% in 2015, with higher unit volume in Drawn Wire more than offset by steel-related price decreases and reduced rod mill trade sales.\nEBIT and EBIT margin improved versus 2014, with cost reductions more than offsetting $6 million of impairment charges and a $3 million loss on divestiture, both of which related to our Steel Tubing business.\nSpecialized Products\nIn Specialized Products, sales increased 4% in 2015, with volume gains in Automotive and Machinery partially offset by currency impact. Our Automotive business continued to experience strong growth from a combination of factors, including expanded component content (via upgraded features), participation in new vehicle platforms, and continued industry growth in each of the major markets.\nEBIT and EBIT margin increased primarily from higher sales.\nResults from Discontinued Operations\nFull year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased to $1 million from a loss of $124 million in 2014. This significant increase is primarily due to the non-recurrence of an impairment charge of $93 million related to the goodwill of the Store Fixtures business discussed on page 80, and foam litigation accruals of $22 million discussed on page 114. The divestiture of the majority of that business late in 2014 resulted in an additional loss of $5 million. For further information about discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 76.\nPART II\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS-2014 vs. 2013\nSales from continuing operations grew 9% in 2014 from a combination of strong organic growth in many of our major businesses and acquisitions. Earnings from continuing operations increased in 2014, largely due to sales growth. Other items in 2013 and 2014 essentially offset.\nFurther details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.\nConsolidated Results (continuing operations)\nThe following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from continuing operations during 2014, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales (continuing operations):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same location sales - primarily unit volume growth\n</td> <td>189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition sales growth\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from continuing operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts, net of tax)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-recurrence of Commercial Vehicle Products impairment and related charges\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-recurrence of acquisition-related bargain purchase gain\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation accrual\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other factors, including benefit from higher sales\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings Per Diluted Share (continuing operations)-2013\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings Per Diluted Share (continuing operations)-2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSame location sales (from continuing operations) grew 6%, reflecting strong volume gains in Automotive and in most of the company's Residential Furnishings businesses. These improvements were partially offset by weak demand in Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP).\nSales growth in 2014 also benefited from the acquisition of Tempur Sealy's three innerspring component production facilities and other smaller acquisitions. In conjunction with the purchase of the facilities from Tempur Sealy, we expanded and extended our supply relationship and became the exclusive long-term provider in the U.S. and Canada of wire-based innersprings for Tempur Sealy and boxsprings for Sealy.\nEarnings from continuing operations increased in 2014, with several items contributing to the year-over-year comparison. Operationally, earnings growth resulted primarily from higher sales, however this benefit was partially offset by higher stock compensation expense that resulted in large part from the significant increase in Leggett & Platt share price versus the market in late 2014. Reduced metal margins in our steel rod and wire operations and weather-related costs and inefficiencies early in the year also offset some of the earnings benefit from higher sales.\nAs indicated in the table above, a few additional items impacted the year-over-year earnings comparison. In 2013, earnings from continuing operations reflected non-cash impairment and other charges related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of our CVP business, and a bargain purchase gain related to the acquisition of an\nPART II\naerospace tubing business. Earnings from continuing operations in 2014 were negatively impacted by litigation accruals, which primarily related to the foam antitrust cases discussed on page 114.\nLIFO Impact\nAll of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory. In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e., outside the segments) to convert about 50% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories. Steel inflation in late 2013 resulted in full-year LIFO expense of $4 million. In 2014, steel costs were relatively stable and we ended the year with LIFO expense of $1 million.\nFor further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72.\nInterest and Income Taxes\nNet interest expense in 2014 decreased slightly versus 2013.\nOur 2014 worldwide effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 24%, compared to 22% for 2013. The 2014 tax rate benefited from $14 million of favorable adjustments, including additional Domestic Production Activities Deduction tax benefits for the current and prior years, incremental deferred foreign tax credits, and net favorable adjustments related to prior year tax return filings. The 2013 tax rate includes $17 million of favorable adjustments primarily related to the impact of Mexico tax law changes, the settlement of certain foreign and state tax audits, and a non-taxable bargain purchase gain.\nPART II\nSegment Results (continuing operations)\nIn the following section we discuss 2014 sales and EBIT from continuing operations for each of our segments. We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84. All segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the change in segment structure discussed on page 31.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

</tr>\n</table>\n______________________________\n (1) This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures. These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier. \n (2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales. Overall company margin is calculated on external sales. \nResidential Furnishings\nResidential Furnishings sales increased 14% in 2014, from unit volume growth in most product categories and acquisitions (including the purchase of the three Tempur Sealy innerspring production facilities). Volume grew in Bedding, Home Furniture, Geo Components, Fabric Converting, and Carpet Cushion, from a combination of market share gains and broadly improving market demand in the second half of the year. Within our U.S. Spring business, we experienced significant growth in ComfortCore\u00ae (our pocketed coil innerspring), with unit volume in that product category up 52%. Mattress producers continued to integrate these higher-valued innersprings into more of their product lines, in many cases replacing lower-valued innersprings. In our Furniture Hardware business, unit volume increased 10% as consumer demand for reclining chairs and sofas continued to grow.\nEBIT and EBIT margin decreased in 2014, with the benefit from higher sales more than offset by a $54 million accrual related to the foam litigation discussed on page 114, and higher stock compensation expense.\nPART II\nCommercial Products\nSales in Commercial Products increased 10% in 2014. Demand was extremely strong in our Adjustable Bed business, with unit volume increasing 56% from a combination of new programs and strength in ongoing customer programs. We also benefited from market share gains and improved market demand in our Work Furniture business.\nEBIT improved slightly and EBIT margin was flat in 2014, with the benefit from higher sales partially offset by operational challenges with a Chinese joint venture.\nIndustrial Materials\nSales in the segment increased 3% in 2014. Growth in logistics services (primarily with other Leggett operations) was partially offset by reduced trade sales from our rod mill and lower wire volume.\nEBIT and EBIT margin declined versus 2013, primarily due to reduced metal margin in our steel rod and wire operations, and weather-related costs and inefficiencies early in 2014.\nSpecialized Products\nIn Specialized Products, sales increased 12% in 2014. Same location sales were up 8% and Aerospace acquisitions completed in 2013 also contributed to the full-year sales growth. Our Automotive business continued to experience strong growth, with sales up 17% from a combination of factors, including expanded component content (via upgraded features), participation in new vehicle platforms, and demand strength in each of the major markets. Partially offsetting this growth, CVP sales declined 21%, reflecting delayed vehicle replacement by major fleet operators and a change in an OEM incentive program. Machinery sales increased modestly for the year.\nEBIT and EBIT margin increased due to higher sales and the non-recurrence of impairment and other charges (of $67 million) related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of our CVP business that were recognized in 2013.\nResults from Discontinued Operations\nFull year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased to a loss of $124 million in 2014 (versus earnings of $13 million in 2013). This significant decline is primarily due to an impairment charge of $93 million related to the goodwill of the Store Fixtures business discussed on page 80, and foam litigation accruals of $22 million discussed on page 114. The divestiture of the majority of that business late in 2014 resulted in an additional loss of $5 million. Earnings in 2013 reflected an $8 million tax benefit attributable to another small operation. For further information about discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 76.\nPART II\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITALIZATION\nOur operations provide most of the cash we require, and debt may also be used to fund a portion of our needs. Cash from operations was once again strong in 2015. For over 25 years, our operations have provided more than enough cash to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments. We expect this to again be the case in 2016.\nCapital expenditures increased in 2015 from investments to support growth in Automotive, U.S. Spring, and Adjustable Bed. We increased the quarterly dividend and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 44 years. We also bought back 4.3 million shares of our stock during the year.\nIn August 2015, we repaid $200 million of 5.0% notes that matured. We ended 2015 with over $400 million of our commercial paper program available. Net debt to net capital at year end was 34.5%, within our long-standing targeted range of 30-40%. The calculation of net debt as a percent of net capital is presented on page 47.\nCash from Operations\nCash from operations is our primary source of funds. Earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations.\nCash from operations decreased in 2015. Though earnings increased during the year, the benefit to operating cash flow was more than offset by foam litigation payments totaling $82 million. The decrease in 2014 (versus 2013) was primarily from higher accounts receivable associated with increased sales volume late in that year.\nWith the foam litigation settlements largely complete, we expect cash from operations to approximate $450 million in 2016.\nPART II\nWe continue to closely monitor our working capital levels, and ended 2015 with adjusted working capital at 9.5% of annualized sales1. The table below explains this non-GAAP calculation. We eliminate cash and current debt maturities from working capital to monitor our performance related to operating efficiency and believe this provides a more useful measurement. The increase in adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized sales in 2015 primarily reflects decreased litigation accruals from payments made during the year.\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current liabilities\n</td> <td>(701\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(992\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital\n</td> <td>610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>438\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(253\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(333\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current debt maturities\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted working capital\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized sales 1\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized sales\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital as a percent of annualized sales\n</td> <td>16.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________________\n 1. Annualized sales equal 4th quarter sales ($945 million in 2015 and $953 million in 2014) multiplied by 4. We believe measuring our working capital against this sales metric is more useful, since efficient management of working capital includes adjusting those net asset levels to reflect current business volume. \nThree primary components of our working capital are discussed below.\nTrade Receivables - The payment trends by our major customers remained stable in 2015, with slight improvements in full year bad debt expense compared to 2014 levels. We continue to look for ways to improve payment patterns of customers and offer programs with incentives for early payment offered in conjunction with third parties when appropriate. Trade Receivables decreased slightly in 2015, primarily due to price deflation and currency translation impacts.\nTotal Inventories - The physical flow of materials through our production facilities is materially the same as in prior periods, and we are not experiencing a buildup of inventory. Expense associated with slow moving and obsolete inventories in 2015 was generally in line with that of 2014. Further, we review usage and inventory quantities at the part number level to determine if current inventory amounts are recoverable by future demand, and reserve necessary amounts on a timely basis.\nFIFO Inventory decreased in 2015 primarily due to significant steel-related price deflation and currency fluctuations. These decreases were partially offset by the timing of certain customer orders late in the year, opportunistic purchases of raw materials, and continued sales growth (which requires additional inventory for support).\nThe increase in our fourth quarter DIO is directly related to the effects of the LIFO method of accounting for inventories and the significant deflation in steel prices during 2015. Under LIFO accounting, the most recent raw material purchases are assumed to be the first consumed in production. Significant steel price deflation resulted in a significant decrease in our LIFO reserves, particularly in the fourth quarter, making comparability to prior quarter's DIO difficult.\nAccounts Payable - Our payment terms are materially consistent with our past practices. We strive to optimize payment terms with our vendors and third parties that allow flexible payment options. Our accounts payable balance decreased at December 31, 2015 vs. 2014 primarily due to steel deflation (that led to lower cost of raw material purchases), currency fluctuations, and timing of payments for inventory purchases. Steel deflation (which was particularly sharp in the fourth quarter), also drove a decrease in our fourth quarter 2015 DPO.\nPART II\nThe following table presents dollar amounts of key working capital components at the end of the past two years.\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount (in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade Receivables, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories at FIFO\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LIFO Reserve\n</td> <td>(23\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total inventories at LIFO, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts Payable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(63\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe next chart shows recent trends in key working capital components (expressed in numbers of days at the end of the past five quarters).\n 1. The inventory ratio represents days of inventory on hand calculated as: ending net inventory \u00f7 (quarterly cost of goods sold \u00f7 number of days in the quarter). \n 2. The trade receivables ratio represents the days of sales outstanding calculated as: ending net trade receivables \u00f7 (quarterly net sales \u00f7 number of days in the quarter). \n 3. The accounts payable ratio represents the days of payables outstanding calculated as: ending accounts payable \u00f7 (quarterly cost of goods sold \u00f7 number of days in the quarter). \nPART II\nUses of Cash\nFinance Capital Requirements\nCash is readily available to fund selective growth, both internally (through capital expenditures) and externally (through acquisitions).\nIn certain of our businesses and product lines we have minimal excess capacity, and we are investing to support continued growth. In Automotive, we are expanding capacity to support new programs that will begin production in 2016 and later years. In Bedding, we are investing in equipment (that we build in our own Swiss operation) to support ongoing growth in ComfortCore\u00ae innersprings. In Adjustable Bed, which operated a single large location until 2015, we have added new locations to broaden our geographic scope and now operate four facilities in North America.\nIn many of our other businesses, we have available capacity to accommodate additional volume. For each additional $100 million of sales from incremental unit volume produced utilizing spare capacity, we expect to generate approximately $25 million to $35 million of additional pre-tax earnings. With market share gains and higher market demand, our capacity utilization has increased. The earnings and margin improvement that we have realized over the past few years reflects, in part, that higher utilization.\nWe will continue to make investments to support growth in businesses and product lines where sales are strong, and for efficiency improvement and maintenance. We expect capital expenditures to approximate $130 million in 2016. Our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital. This emphasis heightens the focus on asset utilization and helps ensure that we are investing additional capital dollars where attractive return potential exists.\nOur strategic, long-term, 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions. We are seeking acquisitions primarily within our business units that have been designated as Grow businesses, and are looking for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).\nIn 2013, we acquired two small businesses that supply tubing and tubing sub-assemblies to the aerospace market.\nPART II\nIn 2014, we purchased the three Tempur Sealy U.S. innerspring component production facilities for $45 million. We also acquired a German designer and distributor of high-end, European-styled motion components for residential furniture.\nIn 2015, we acquired a 70% interest in a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial, and other settings for $23 million. This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally.\nAdditional details about these and other smaller acquisitions can be found in Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 109.\nPay Dividends\nIncreasing the dividend remains a high priority. In 2015, we increased the quarterly dividend to $.32 per share and extended our record of consecutive annual dividend increases to 44 years, at an average compound growth rate of 13%. Our targeted dividend payout ratio is approximately 50-60% of net earnings, however the actual payout has been higher in recent years. As a result, dividend growth in recent years has been modest, at about 3% per year. With significant earnings improvement in 2015, the dividend payout ratio for the year was within the target range. This should allow us flexibility to consider future dividend growth that more closely aligns with earnings growth.\nDuring 2012, we declared four quarterly dividends, but paid five, given our decision to accelerate into December 2012 the dividend typically paid in January 2013 (of $41 million) in anticipation of tax rate increases on individual taxpayers. In 2013, we returned to our prior practice and paid the fourth quarter dividend in January 2014. Therefore, the cash requirement for dividends in 2013 was lower, at $125 million.\nPART II\nRepurchase Stock\nAs shown in the chart above, share repurchases were significant in each of the last three years. During that time frame, we repurchased a total of 15.6 million shares of our stock and issued 9.1 million shares (through employee benefit plans and stock option exercises), reducing outstanding shares by 5%. In 2015, we repurchased 4.3 million shares (at an average of $45.72) and issued 2.1 million shares (at an average of $23.61).\nOur top priorities for use of cash are organic growth (via capital expenditures), dividends, and strategic acquisitions. After funding those priorities, if there is still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt or stockpile cash. We have been authorized by the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year, but we have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable.\nPART II\nCapitalization\nThis table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years.\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt outstanding:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Scheduled maturities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average interest rates (1)\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average maturities in years (1)\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit/commercial paper\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average interest rate\n</td> <td>.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt\n</td> <td>945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>689\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income taxes and other liabilities\n</td> <td>223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>1,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capitalization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused committed credit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>584\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total unused committed credit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>584\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current maturities of long-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>273\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of earnings to fixed charges (2)\n</td> <td>8.6 x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0 x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8 x\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________________\n (1) These rates include current maturities, but exclude commercial paper to reflect the averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities.

Earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed charges. \nPART II\nThe next table shows the percent of long-term debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2015 and 2014, calculated in two ways:\n \u2022 Long-term debt and total capitalization as reported in the previous table. \n \u2022 Long-term debt and total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long-term debt. \nWe believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more useful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly. We use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage.\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>767\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current debt maturities\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(253\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(333\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capitalization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current debt maturities\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(253\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(333\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net capitalization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt to total capitalization\n</td> <td>41.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net debt to net capitalization\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal debt (which includes long-term debt and current debt maturities) decreased $21 million in 2015. We repaid $200 million of 5.0% notes that matured in August 2015 and funded the payoff with a combination of cash and commercial paper.\nShort Term Borrowings\nWe can raise cash by issuing up to $600 million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a $600 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 12 lenders. This agreement expires in 2019. The credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit totaling up to $250 million. When we issue letters of credit in this manner, our capacity under the agreement, and consequently, our ability to issue commercial paper, is reduced by a corresponding amount. Amounts outstanding related to our commercial paper program were:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total program authorized\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper outstanding (classified as long-term debt)\n</td> <td>(181\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit issued under the credit agreement\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total program usage\n</td> <td>(181\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total program available\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>584\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe average and maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2015 was $136 million and $315 million, respectively. During the fourth quarter, the average and maximum amounts outstanding were $255 million and $289 million respectively. At year end, we had no letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement, but we had $64 million of stand-by letters of credit outside the agreement to take advantage of more attractive fee pricing.\nPART II\nWith operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, and our ability to issue debt in the capital markets, we believe we have sufficient funds available to repay maturing debt, as well as support our ongoing operations, pay dividends, fund future growth, and repurchase stock.\nOur revolving credit agreement and certain other long-term debt contain restrictive covenants, with which we were comfortably in compliance as of December 31, 2015. For more information, see Note J on page 91\nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAccessibility of Cash\nAt December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $253 million primarily invested in interest-bearing bank accounts and in bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.\nA substantial portion of these funds are held in the international accounts of our foreign operations. Though we do not rely on this foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs, we believe we could bring most of this cash back to the U.S. over a period of two to three years without material cost. However, due to capital requirements in various jurisdictions, approximately $90 million of this cash is currently inaccessible for repatriation. Additionally, if we had to bring all of the foreign cash back immediately in the form of dividends, we would incur incremental tax expense of up to approximately $107 million. In 2015, 2014, and 2013, we brought back cash of $112 million, $129 million, and $119 million, respectively, in each case at little to no added tax cost.\nPART II\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2015:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less\nThan 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More\nThan 5\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt \u00b9\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized leases\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations \u00b2\n</td> <td>296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments \u00b3\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income taxes\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other obligations (including pensions and net reserves for tax contingencies) 4\n</td> <td>189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>884\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n 1. The long-term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due. \n 2. Purchase obligations primarily include open short-term (30-120 days) purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities. \n 3.

To do so, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and disclosures. If we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change, and some of those changes could be significant. Our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management, at the time they are made, to be reasonable and appropriate. Estimates are adjusted for actual events, as they occur.\nCritical accounting estimates\u201d are those that are: a) subject to uncertainty and change, and b) of material impact to our financial statements. Listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements.\nWe provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72.\n Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Goodwill Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of June 30 and as triggering events occur. The Steel Tubing unit met the held for sale criteria during the first quarter of 2015. Because fair value less cost to sell had fallen below recorded book value, we fully impaired this unit's goodwill and incurred a non-cash charge of $4 million in the first quarter of 2015. In July 2014, we concluded that an impairment was required related to the goodwill of the Store Fixtures group, which was formerly part of the Commercial Products segment and is now reported in discontinued operations. A non-cash charge of $108 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2014 for the complete write-off of the goodwill associated with this business. In December 2013, we concluded that an impairment was required relating to the goodwill of the Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP) group. A non-cash charge of $63 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013. In order to assess goodwill for potential impairment, judgment is required to estimate the fair market value of each reporting unit (which is one level below reportable segments) using the combination of a discounted cash flow model and a market approach using price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. The cash flow model contains uncertainties related to the forecast of future results as many outside economic and competitive factors can influence future performance. Margins, sales growth, and discount rates are the most critical estimates in determining enterprise values using the cash flow model. The market approach requires judgment to determine the appropriate price to earnings ratio. Ratios are derived from comparable publicly-traded companies that operate in the same or similar industry as the reporting unit. The second quarter 2015 goodwill impairment review indicated no impairments, with all reporting units having fair values that exceed carrying value by more than 50%. We have $806 million of goodwill at December 31, 2015, including $12 million associated with the CVP reporting unit. As discussed in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79, we continue to explore strategic alternatives for this reporting unit. If we are not able to meet projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible. Information regarding material assumptions used to determine if a goodwill impairment exists can be found in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79. \nPART II\n Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Other Long-lived Assets Other long-lived assets are tested for recoverability at year-end and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other long-lived assets we estimate fair value at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured (usually at a branch level). Impairments of other long-lived assets usually occur when major restructuring activities take place, or we decide to discontinue product lines completely. Our impairment assessments have uncertainties because they require estimates of future cash flows to determine if undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover carrying values of these assets. For assets where future cash flows are not expected to recover carrying value, fair value is estimated which requires an estimate of market value based upon asset appraisals for like assets. These impairments are unpredictable. Impairments were $2 million in 2015, $1 million in 2014 and $2 million in 2013. Inventory Reserves We reduce the carrying value of inventories to reflect an estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving inventory. We value inventory at net realizable value (what we think we will recover). Generally a reserve is not required unless we have more than a one-year's supply of the product. If we have had no sales of a given product for 12 months, those items are generally deemed to have no value and are written down completely. Our inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow-moving (i.e., not selling very quickly). Changes in customer behavior and requirements can cause inventory to quickly become obsolete or slow moving. The calculation also uses an estimate of the ultimate recoverability of items identified as slow moving based upon historical experience (65% on average). At December 31, 2015, the reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventory was $33 million (approximately 6% of FIFO inventories). This is consistent with the December 31, 2014 and 2013 reserves of $30 million and $36"}
