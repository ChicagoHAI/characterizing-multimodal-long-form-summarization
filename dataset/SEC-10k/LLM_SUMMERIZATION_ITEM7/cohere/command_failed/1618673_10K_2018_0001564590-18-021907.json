Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Part II, Item 6. - Selected Financial Data\u201d and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nOur Company\nWe market and distribute over 150,000 food and food-related products to customers across the United States from approximately 73 distribution facilities to over 150,000 customer locations in the food-away-from-home\u201d industry. We offer our customers a broad assortment of products including our proprietary-branded products, nationally-branded products, and products bearing our customers' brands. Our product assortment ranges from center-of-the-plate\u201d items (such as beef, pork, poultry, and seafood), frozen foods, and groceries to candy, snacks, and beverages. We also sell disposables, cleaning and kitchen supplies, and related products used by our customers. In addition to the products we offer to our customers, we provide value-added services by allowing our customers to benefit from our industry knowledge, scale, and expertise in the areas of product selection and procurement, menu development, and operational strategy.\nWe have three reportable segments: Performance Foodservice, PFG Customized, and Vistar. Our Performance Foodservice segment distributes a broad line of national brands, customer brands, and our proprietary-branded food and food-related products, or Performance Brands.\u201d Performance Foodservice sells to independent, or Street,\u201d and multi-unit, or Chain,\u201d restaurants and other institutions such as schools, healthcare facilities, and business and industry locations. Our PFG Customized segment has provided longstanding service to some of the most recognizable family and casual dining restaurant chains and recently expanded service into fast casual and quick service restaurant chains. Our Vistar segment specializes in distributing candy, snacks, beverages, and other items nationally to the vending, office coffee service, theater, retail, hospitality, and other channels. We believe that there are substantial synergies across our segments. Cross-segment synergies include procurement, operational best practices such as the use of new productivity technologies, and supply chain and network optimization, as well as shared corporate functions such as accounting, treasury, tax, legal, information systems, and human resources.\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 52-week year for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 and a 53-week year for fiscal 2016. References to fiscal 2018\u201d are to the 52-week period ended June 30, 2018, references to fiscal 2017\u201d are to the 52-week period ended July 1, 2017, and references to fiscal 2016\u201d are to the 53-week period ended July 2, 2016.\nRecent Trends and Initiatives\nOur case volume has grown in each quarter over the comparable prior fiscal year quarter, starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 and continuing through the most recent quarter. We believe that we gained industry share during fiscal 2018 given that we have grown our sales more rapidly than the industry growth rate forecasted by Technomic, a research and consulting firm serving the food and food related industry. Our Net income increased 106.3% and Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.2% from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018, primarily driven by case growth and improved gross margin. Case volume grew 3.0% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Gross profit dollars rose 7.9% in fiscal 2018 versus the prior year, which was faster than case growth, primarily as a result of shifting our channel mix toward higher gross margin customers and shifting our product mix toward sales of Performance Brands. Our operating expenses in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 rose 6.6% as a result of increases in variable operational and selling expenses associated with the increase in case volume, as well as an increase in fuel expense and investments in selling, warehouse, and delivery personnel.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Business\nWe believe that our performance is principally affected by the following key factors:\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changing demographic and macroeconomic trends. The share of consumer spending captured by the food-away-from-home industry increased steadily for several decades and paused during the recession that began in 2008. Following the recession, the share has again increased as a result of increasing employment, rising disposable income, increases in the number of restaurants, and favorable demographic trends, such as smaller household sizes, an increasing number of dual income households, and an aging population base that spends more per capita at foodservice establishments. The\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> foodservice distribution industry is also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions, such as changes in consumer spending, changes in consumer confidence, and changes in the prices of certain goods.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Food distribution market structure. The food distribution market consists of a wide spectrum of companies ranging from businesses selling a single category of product (e.g., produce) to large national and regional broadline distributors with many distribution centers and thousands of products across all categories. We believe our scale enables us to invest in our Performance Brands, to benefit from economies of scale in purchasing and procurement, and to drive supply chain efficiencies that enhance our customers' satisfaction and profitability. We believe that the relative growth of larger foodservice distributors will continue to outpace that of smaller, independent players in our industry.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our ability to successfully execute our segment strategies and implement our initiatives. Our performance will continue to depend on our ability to successfully execute our segment strategies and to implement our current and future initiatives. The key strategies include focusing on independent sales and Performance Brands, pursuing new customers for all three of our reportable segments, expansion of geographies, utilizing our infrastructure to gain further operating and purchasing efficiencies, and making strategic acquisitions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures used by our management are discussed below. The percentages on the results presented below are calculated based on rounded numbers.\nNet Sales\nNet sales is equal to gross sales minus sales returns; sales incentives that we offer to our customers, such as rebates and discounts that are offsets to gross sales; and certain other adjustments. Our net sales are driven by changes in case volumes, product inflation that is reflected in the pricing of our products, and mix of products sold.\nGross Profit\nGross profit is equal to our net sales minus our cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold primarily includes inventory costs (net of supplier consideration) and inbound freight. Cost of goods sold generally changes as we incur higher or lower costs from our suppliers and as our customer and product mix changes.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nManagement measures operating performance based on our EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) and is not a measure of operating income, operating performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is subject to important limitations. Our definition of EBITDA may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDA enhances an investor's understanding of our performance. We use this measure to evaluate the performance of our segments and for business planning purposes. We present EBITDA in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, and such information is not meant to replace or supersede U.S. GAAP measures.\nIn addition, our management uses Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income and franchise taxes, and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude certain items that we do not consider part of our core operating results. Such adjustments include certain unusual, non-cash, non-recurring, cost reduction, and other adjustment items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under our credit agreement and indenture (other than certain pro forma adjustments permitted under our credit agreement and indenture relating to the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of acquired entities or businesses prior to the acquisition date). Under our credit agreement and indenture, our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness, making certain investments, and making restricted payments is tied to ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement and indenture). Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not defined under U.S. GAAP and is subject to important limitations. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties, including our lenders under the ABL Facility and holders of our Notes (as defined below under -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d), in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies in industries similar to ours. In addition, targets based on Adjusted EBITDA are among the measures we use to evaluate our management's performance for purposes of determining their compensation under our incentive plans.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. For example, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> do not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service our debt.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn calculating Adjusted EBITDA, we add back certain non-cash, non-recurring, and other items as permitted or required by our credit agreement and indenture. Adjusted EBITDA among other things:\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> does not include non-cash stock-based employee compensation expense and certain other non-cash charges;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> does not include cash and non-cash restructuring, severance, and relocation costs incurred to realize future cost savings and enhance our operations; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> does not reflect management fees paid to Blackstone and Wellspring.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have included the calculations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented.\nResults of Operations, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA\nThe following table

Net sales increased $858.1 million, or 5.1%, in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to sales growth in Vistar, particularly in the theater and retail channels, case growth in Performance Foodservice, particularly in the independent channel, and recent acquisitions. Case volume increased 3.0% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased $168.0 million, or 7.9%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 13.0% for fiscal 2018 compared to 12.7% for fiscal 2017. The increase in gross profit was the result of growth in cases sold and a higher gross profit per case, which in turn was the result of selling an improved mix of channels and products. Within Performance Foodservice, case growth to independent customers positively affected gross profit per case. Independent customers typically receive more services from us, cost more to serve, and pay a higher gross profit per case than other customers. Also, in fiscal 2018, Performance Foodservice grew our Performance Brand sales, which have higher gross profit per case compared to the other brands we sell. See -Segment Results-Performance Foodservice\u201d below for additional discussion.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased $125.5 million, or 6.6%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the increase in acquired case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses, as well as investments in selling, warehouse, and delivery personnel. Operating expenses also increased in fiscal 2018 as a result of increases in fuel expense of $15.7 million and stock-based compensation expense of $4.3 million, partially offset by a $2.6 million decrease in advisory fees and a $1.8 million decrease in professional fees.\nDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased from $126.1 million in fiscal 2017 to $130.1 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of 3.2%. Depreciation of fixed assets increased as a result of capital outlays to support our growth, as well as recent acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by decreases in amortization since certain intangibles are now fully amortized compared to the prior year.\nNet Income\nNet income increased by $102.4 million, or 106.3%, to $198.7 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in net income was attributable to the $42.5 million increase in operating profit and the $66.5 million decrease in income tax expense, partially offset by a $5.5 million increase in interest expense, and a $1.1 million decrease in other income.\nThe increase in operating profit was a result of the increase in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in the average interest rate and higher average borrowings during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The $1.1 million decrease in other income related primarily to derivative activity.\nThe decrease in income tax expense was primarily a result of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d). Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 was -2.6% compared to 39.0% in fiscal 2017. The Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Among its numerous changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate rate from 35% to 21%, which resulted in a blended U.S. federal statutory rate of approximately 28% for fiscal 2018 for the Company. As a result of the Act, the Company revalued its net deferred tax liability, resulting in a decrease to the net deferred tax liability of $38.5 million with a corresponding net benefit to income tax expense for fiscal 2018. As a result of a blended statutory rate for fiscal 2018, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $11.9 million for the rate differential related to temporary differences. Additionally, in fiscal 2018, performance vesting criteria for certain stock-based compensation awards was met resulting in an excess tax benefit of $15.4 million.\nFiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales growth is primarily a function of case growth, pricing (which is primarily based on product inflation/deflation), and a changing mix of customers, channels, and product categories sold. Net sales increased $657.0 million, or 4.1%, in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to case growth in Performance Foodservice, particularly in the independent channel, and sales growth in Vistar, particularly in the retail, theater, vending, and hospitality channels partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal year 2016. Net sales for the extra week in fiscal 2016 were approximately $312.4 million. Net sales growth was driven by case volume growth of 4.1% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, case volume increased 6.2% compared to the prior year.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased $114.8 million, or 5.7%, for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in gross profit was the result of growth in cases sold and a higher gross profit per case, which in turn was the result of selling an improved mix of channels and products, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. Within Performance Foodservice, case growth to independent customers positively affected gross profit per case. Independent customers typically receive more services from us, cost more to serve, and pay a higher gross profit per case than other customers. Also, in fiscal 2017, Performance Foodservice grew our Performance Brand sales, which have higher gross profit per case compared to the other brands we sell. See -Segment Results-Performance Foodservice\u201d below for additional discussion. The Company estimates that the gross profit for the extra week in fiscal 2016 was approximately $40.1 million.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased $106.0 million, or 5.9%, for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the increase in case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses, as well as investments associated with expansion of geographies served in the dollar store channel, transition of business within PFG Customized and the opening of our automated retail facility within the Vistar segment. Additionally, operating expenses increased for fiscal year 2017 as a result of an $8.4 million increase in insurance expense primarily related to workers compensation and professional and legal fees including settlements of $3.0 million. The increase was partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. Operating expenses for the extra week is fiscal 2016 were approximately $35.3 million.\nDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased from $118.6 million in fiscal 2016 to $126.1 million in fiscal 2017, an increase of 6.3%. Depreciation of fixed assets increased as a result of larger capital outlays to support our growth, as well as recent acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by decreases in amortization since certain intangibles are now fully amortized compared to the prior year.\nNet Income\nNet income increased by $28.0 million, or 41.0%, to $96.3 million for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in net income was attributable to an $8.8 million increase in operating profit, a $29.0 million decrease in interest expense, and a $5.4 million decrease in other expense, partially offset by a $15.2 million increase in income tax expense. The Company estimates that net income for the extra week in fiscal 2016 was approximately $2.1 million.\nThe increase in operating profit was a result of the increase in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses. The decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of lower average interest rates during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and a $9.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt and $5.5 million of accelerated amortization of original issuance discount and deferred financing costs in fiscal 2016.\nThe $5.4 million decrease in other expense related primarily to a $4.7 million decrease in expense related to settlements on our derivatives and a $2.0 million increase in income from hedge ineffectiveness in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. These increases were partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in non-cash income primarily related to the change in fair value of our derivatives for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.\nThe increase in income tax expense was primarily a result of the increase in income before taxes, partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was 39.0% compared to 40.3% in fiscal 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate was a result of an increase in other permanent deductions and a reduction in non-deductible expenses and state income tax as a percentage of income before taxes. Since non-deductible expenses tend to be relatively constant, there is a favorable rate impact as income before taxes increases.\nSegment Results\nWe have three reportable segments as described above-Performance Foodservice, PFG Customized, and Vistar. Management evaluates the performance of these segments based on their respective sales growth and EBITDA. For PFG Customized, EBITDA includes certain allocated corporate expenses that are included in operating expenses. The allocated corporate expenses are determined based on a percentage of total sales. This percentage is reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that the allocation reflects a reasonable rate of corporate expenses based on their use of corporate services.\nCorporate & All Other is comprised of unallocated corporate overhead and certain operations that are not considered separate reportable segments based on their size. This includes the operations of our internal logistics unit responsible for managing and allocating inbound logistics revenue and expense, as well as the operations of certain recent acquisitions.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company reorganized its information technology department, and expenses associated with business application teams are now included in the segment results. The EBITDA for Performance Foodservice, Vistar and Corporate & All Other for the fiscal years ended July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016 have been adjusted to reflect this change.\nThe following tables set

Results-Performance Foodservice\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017\nNet Sales\nNet sales for Performance Foodservice increased $608.8 million, or 6.2%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. The increase in net sales was attributable to growth in cases sold, as well as an increase in selling price per case as a result of inflation. Case growth in fiscal 2018 was driven by securing new independent customers and further penetrating existing customers. Securing new and expanded business with independent customers resulted in independent sales growth of approximately 8.4% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2018, independent sales as a percentage of total segment sales were 45.2%.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for Performance Foodservice increased $10.6 million, or 3.3%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. This increase was the result of an increase in gross profit, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Gross profit increased by 6.0% in fiscal 2018, compared to the prior fiscal year, as a result of an increase in cases sold, as well as an increase in the gross profit per case. The increase in gross profit per case was driven by a favorable shift in the mix of cases sold toward independent customers and Performance Brands, as well as by an increase in procurement gains. Independent business has higher gross margins than Chain customers within this segment.\nOperating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization for Performance Foodservice increased by $77.1 million, or 6.8%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. Operating expenses increased as a result of an increase in case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses, as well as investments in selling, warehouse, and delivery personnel. Operating expenses also increased as a result of a $10.3 million increase in fuel expense, which mostly occurred in the second half of fiscal 2018.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $57.4 million in fiscal 2017 to $58.7 million in fiscal 2018. This increase was a result of recent acquisitions, computer software, capital leases and warehouse expansion, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets since certain intangibles are now fully amortized.\nFiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales for Performance Foodservice increased $206.1 million, or 2.1%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. This increase in net sales was attributable to growth in cases sold, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. Net sales for the extra week in fiscal 2016 were approximately $188.0 million. Case growth in fiscal 2017 was driven by securing new independent customers and further penetrating existing customers. Securing new and expanded business with independent customers resulted in independent sales growth of approximately 4.6% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2017, independent sales as a percentage of total segment sales were 44.4%.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for Performance Foodservice increased $16.8 million, or 5.5%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. This increase was the result of an increase in gross profit, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization. Gross profit increased by 4.4% in fiscal 2017, compared to the prior fiscal year, as a result of an increase in cases sold, as well as an increase in the gross profit per case, partially offset by gross profit of approximately $28.3 million in the extra week in fiscal 2016. The increase in gross profit per case was driven by a favorable shift in the mix of cases sold toward independent customers and Performance Brands, as well as by an increase in procurement gains. Independent business has higher gross margins than Chain customers within this segment.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for Performance Foodservice increased by $45.3 million, or 4.1%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. Operating expenses increased as a result of an increase in case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses, as well as cost of living and other increases in compensation and benefits and increase in costs associated with insurance expense primarily related to workers' compensation and vehicle liability of $5.9 million. These increases were partially offset by the extra week in fiscal 2016. The Company estimates that operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization were approximately $21.2 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2016.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment decreased from $63.2 million in fiscal 2016 to $57.4 million in fiscal 2017, a decrease of 9.2%. These reductions were a result of a decrease in amortization of intangible assets since certain intangibles are now fully amortized.\nSegment Results-PFG Customized\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017\nNet Sales\nNet sales for PFG Customized decreased $162.3 million, or 4.2%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. The decrease in net sales was primarily a result of the Georgia facility that was closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding the impact of the closed Georgia facility, net sales would have increased $65.0 million in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year as a result of an increase in selling price per case driven by a favorable shift in customer mix.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for PFG Customized increased $4.2 million, or 16.6%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of the closed Georgia facility, an increase in gross profit was offset by an increase in operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization. Gross profit for PFG Customized increased primarily as a result of a favorable shift in customer mix.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased by $9.4 million, or 4.5%, in fiscal 2018, compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the closed Georgia facility, partially offset by increases in personnel expenses and fuel expense.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment decreased from $16.1 million in fiscal 2017 to $14.6 million in fiscal 2018. This decrease is primarily a result of lower amortization expense for certain customer relationship intangible assets, which are now fully amortized.\nFiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales for PFG Customized increased $38.7 million, or 1.0%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales was driven by the new business with Red Lobster in fiscal 2017, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. Net sales for the extra week in fiscal 2016 were approximately $70.2 million.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for PFG Customized decreased $8.8 million, or 25.8%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in gross profit of $5.1 million, or 2.1%, and an increase in operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization. Gross profit for PFG Customized decreased primarily as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 and planned exits of some customers to free up capacity for the addition of the new business with Red Lobster. The Company estimates that gross profit was approximately $4.4 million for the extra week in fiscal 2016. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we began providing distribution solutions to a portion of Red Lobster's restaurants and completed the transition during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased by $3.7 million, or 1.8%, in fiscal 2017, compared to the prior year primarily driven by $5.2 million related to the closing of the Georgia facility, partially offset by $3.8 million of expense in the 53rd week in fiscal 2016.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $15.4 million in fiscal 2016 to $16.1 million in fiscal 2017, an increase of 4.5%. The increase was primarily a result of the accelerated amortization of customer relationship intangible assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 due to volume declines for certain customers.\nSegment Results-Vistar\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017\nNet Sales\nNet sales for Vistar increased $337.4 million, or 11.2%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. This increase was driven by case sales growth in the segment's theater and retail channels, as well as recent acquisitions.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for Vistar increased $15.4 million, or 13.1%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. Gross profit dollar growth of $72.5 million, or 18.4% for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, was driven by an increase in the number of cases sold, as well as an increase in gross profit per case. The increase in gross profit per case was driven by a favorable shift in channel mix, as well as by an increase in procurement gains.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $57.7 million, or 20.9%, for fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year. Operating expenses increased primarily as a result of an increase in case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses, as well as cost of living and other increases in compensation and benefits. Operating expenses also increased as a result of recent acquisitions.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $24.6 million in fiscal 2017 to $27.4 million in fiscal 2018. Amortization of intangible assets increased as a result of recent acquisitions.\nFiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales for Vistar increased $302.1 million, or 11.2%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. This increase was driven by case sales growth in the segment's retail, theater, vending, and hospitality channels and recent acquisitions, partially offset by net sales of approximately $54.1 million in the 53rd week in fiscal 2016.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for Vistar increased $7.6 million, or 6.9%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. This increase in EBITDA was the result of gross profit dollar growth increasing faster than operating expense dollar growth, excluding depreciation and amortization. Gross profit dollar growth of $39.2 million, or 11.0% for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, was driven by an increase in the number of cases sold and recent acquisitions, partially offset by gross profit of approximately $7.0 million in the 53rd week in fiscal 2016.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $30.9 million, or 12.6%, for fiscal 2017. Operating expenses increased primarily as a result of investments associated with expansion of geographies served in the dollar store channel, additional expenses related to recent acquisitions and an increase associated with the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 opening of our automated retail facility, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. The Company estimates that operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization were approximately $4.9 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2016.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $18.2 million in fiscal 2016 to $24.6 million in fiscal 2017, an increase of 35.2%. Amortization of intangible assets increased as a result of acquisitions over the past year. Depreciation of fixed assets increased as a result of capital outlays primarily related to fleet.\nSegment Results-Corporate & All Other\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017\nNet Sales\nNet sales for Corporate & All Other increased $101.6 million from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to recent acquisitions and an increase in logistics services provided to our other segments.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for Corporate & All Other was a negative $109.1 million for fiscal 2018 compared to a negative $124.3 million for fiscal 2017. The improvement in EBITDA was primarily driven by contributions from recent acquisitions and decreases in professional and other services fees of $4.5 million, personnel expenses of $4.4 million, advisory fees of $2.6 million, and insurance of $2.3 million, partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $4.3 million.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $28.0 million in fiscal 2017 to $29.4 million in fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily a result of amortization related to recent acquisitions.\nFiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales for Corporate & All Other increased $127.3 million from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to recent acquisitions and an increase in logistics services provided to our other segments, partially offset by net sales of approximately $4.4 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2016.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for Corporate & All Other was a negative $124.3 million for fiscal 2017 compared to a negative $130.4 million for fiscal 2016. The improvement in EBITDA was primarily driven by recent acquisitions and a $5.5 million decrease in other expenses related to derivative activity, partially offset by an increase in personnel expenses and a $0.8 million increase in professional and legal fees including settlements.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $21.8 million in fiscal 2016 to $28.0 million in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily a result of amortization related to recent acquisitions.\nQuarterly Results and Seasonality\nHistorically, the food-away-from-home and foodservice distribution industries are seasonal, with lower profit in the first and third quarters of each calendar year. Consequently, we typically experience lower operating profit during our first and third fiscal quarters, depending on the timing of acquisitions, if any.\nFinancial information for each quarter of

operating and capital leases, and normal trade credit terms. We have typically funded our acquisitions with additional borrowings under our credit facility. Our working capital and borrowing levels are subject to seasonal fluctuations, typically with the lowest borrowing levels in the third and fourth fiscal quarters and the highest borrowing levels occurring in the first and second fiscal quarters. We believe that our cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient both to meet our anticipated cash requirements over at least the next 12 months and to maintain sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes.\nAt June 30, 2018, our cash balance totaled $17.8 million, including restricted cash of $10.3 million, as compared to a cash balance totaling $21.0 million, including restricted cash of $12.9 million, at July 1, 2017. This decrease in cash during fiscal 2018 was attributable to net cash used in investing activities and financing activities of $209.4 million and $160.8 million, respectively, which was partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities of $367.0 million. We borrow under the ABL Facility or pay it down regularly based on our cash flows from operating and investing activities. Our practice is to minimize interest expense while maintaining reasonable liquidity.\nAs market conditions warrant, we may from time to time seek to repurchase our securities or loans in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Any such repurchases may be funded by incurring new debt, including additional borrowings under our ABL Facility. In addition, depending on conditions in the credit and capital markets and other factors, we will, from time to time, consider other financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance our indebtedness, make investments or acquisitions or for other purposes. Any new debt may be secured debt.\nOn October 6, 2015, we completed our initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) of 16,675,000 shares of common stock for an offering price of $19.00 per share ($17.955 per share net of underwriting discounts), including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. We sold an aggregate of 12,777,325 shares of such common stock and certain selling stockholders sold 3,897,675 shares. The aggregate offering price of the amount of newly issued common stock was $242.8 million. In connection with the offering, we paid the underwriters a discount of $1.045 per share, for a total underwriting discount of $13.4 million. In addition, we incurred direct offering expenses consisting of legal, accounting, and printing costs of $5.8 million in connection with the IPO, of which $3.0 million was paid during fiscal 2016. We used the net proceeds to us from the IPO after deducting the underwriting discount and our direct offering expenses to repay $223.0 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under a credit agreement providing for a term loan facility (the Term Facility\u201d). We used the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nOn February 1, 2016, Performance Food Group, Inc. amended and restated the ABL Facility to increase the aggregate principal amount from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, lower interest rates for LIBOR based loans, extend the maturity from May 2017 to February 2021, and modify triggers and provisions related to certain reporting, financial, and negative covenants. The total size of the facility immediately increased the effective borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility since borrowing base assets exceeded the facility size prior to the amendment. Approximately $6.8 million of fees and expenses were incurred for the amendment, which were included as deferred financing costs and will be amortized over the remaining term of the ABL Facility. Of this amount, $6.6 million was paid during fiscal 2016. In connection with the closing of this amendment, Performance Food Group, Inc. borrowed $200.0 million under the ABL Facility and used the proceeds to repay $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of loans under the Term Facility.\nOn May 17, 2016, Performance Food Group, Inc. issued and sold $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.500% Senior Notes due 2024 (the Notes\u201d), pursuant to an indenture dated as of May 17, 2016, that is jointly and severally guaranteed by PFGC, Inc. ( PFGC\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and all domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of PFGC (other than captive insurance subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries). The proceeds from the Notes were used to pay in full the remaining outstanding $306.4 million aggregate principal amount of loans under the Term Facility and to terminate the Term Facility; to temporarily repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility; and to pay the fees, expenses, and other transaction costs incurred in connection with the Notes. Approximately $7.2 million of fees and expenses were incurred and paid during fiscal 2016 in connection with the Notes. Of the amount of fees incurred, $2.5 was included as deferred financing costs and will be amortized over the remaining term of the Notes, $2.1 million was included in loss on extinguishment of debt within interest expense related to the portion of the Term Facility repayment deemed an extinguishment, and $2.6 million was recorded to Operating expenses for the portion of the Term Facility deemed a modification.\nOn August 3, 2017, PFGC, Inc. and Performance Food Group, Inc., each a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into the First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amendment\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and the other lenders party thereto, which amended the ABL Facility. The Amendment amended the ABL Facility by, among other things, (i) increasing the aggregate principal amount under the ABL Facility from $1.6 billion to $1.95 billion by increasing Tranche A Commitments by $325.0 million and the Tranche A-1 Commitments by\n$25.0 million and (ii) maintaining the level of additional commitments permitted, excluding the additional commitments effected pursuant to the Amendment, at $800.0 million under uncommitted incremental facilities.\nOperating Activities\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017\nDuring fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, our operating activities provided cash flow of $367.0 million and $201.7 million, respectively. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was largely driven by higher operating income, improved working capital management and lower taxes paid.\nFiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016\nDuring fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, our operating activities provided cash flow of $201.7 million and $228.5 million, respectively.\nFiscal 2016 cash flows provided by operating activities included a $25.0 million break-up fee payment received related to the terminated agreement to acquire 11 US Foods facilities from Sysco and US Foods. Excluding this fee, cash flows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2016 were $203.5 million. The remaining $1.8 million decrease, excluding the break-up fee payment, in cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was largely driven by an increase in our net working capital investment, partially offset by lower cash income tax payments as a result of timing of the payments and lower cash interest payments as a result of debt pay down associated with the IPO and subsequent refinancings, as well as changes in the timing of payments. Our net working capital, which includes accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and outstanding checks in excess of deposits, fluctuates with our sales growth.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities totaled $209.4 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $332.0 million in fiscal 2017 and $157.6 million in fiscal 2016. These investments consisted primarily of capital purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $140.1 million, $140.2 million and $119.7 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and payments for business acquisitions of $71.1 million, $192.9 million and $39.0 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In fiscal 2018, purchases of property, plant, and equipment primarily consisted of equipment, transportation and information technology, as well as outlays for warehouse expansions and improvements.\nThe following table presents the capital purchases of property, plant, and equipment by segment:\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> July 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> July 2, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Foodservice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 83.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 91.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PFG Customized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vistar\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate & All Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital purchases of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 140.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 140.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 119.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of June 30, 2018, the Company had commitments of $7.0 million for capital projects related to warehouse expansion and improvements, warehouse equipment and information technology equipment and software. The Company anticipates using cash flows from operations or borrowings from the ABL Facility to fulfill these commitments.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring fiscal 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $160.8 million, which consisted primarily of $119.8 million in net payments under our ABL Facility and cash paid for shares withheld to cover taxes of $28.2 million related to restricted stock vestings.\nDuring fiscal 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $127.5 million, which consisted primarily of $134.9 million in net borrowings under our ABL Facility.\nDuring fiscal 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $76.5 million, which consisted primarily of payments of $736.9 million on our Term Loan Facility, partially offset by $350.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of Notes, $226.4 million in net proceeds from our IPO and $99.3 million in net borrowings under our ABL Facility.\nThe following describes our financing arrangements as of June 30, 2018:\nABL Facility: PFGC, Inc. ( PFGC\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a party to the ABL Facility, which has an aggregate principal amount of $1.95 billion and matures February 2021. The ABL Facility is secured by the majority of the tangible assets of PFGC and its subsidiaries. Performance Food Group, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PFGC, is the lead borrower under the ABL Facility, which is jointly and severally guaranteed by PFGC and all material domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of PFGC (other than captive insurance subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries). Availability for loans and letters of credit under the ABL Facility is governed by a borrowing base, determined by the application of specified advance rates against eligible assets, including trade accounts receivable, inventory, owned real properties, and owned transportation equipment. The borrowing base is reduced quarterly by a cumulative fraction of the real properties and transportation equipment values. Advances on accounts receivable and inventory are subject to change based on periodic commercial finance examinations and appraisals, and the real property and transportation equipment values included in the borrowing base are subject to change based on periodic appraisals. Audits and appraisals are conducted at the direction of the administrative agent for the benefit and on behalf of all lenders.\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest, at Performance Food Group, Inc.'s option, at (a) the Base Rate (defined as the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such date plus 0.5%, (ii) the Prime Rate on such day, or (iii) one month LIBOR plus 1.0%) plus a spread or (b) LIBOR plus a spread. The ABL Facility also provides for an unused commitment fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.375%.\nThe following table summarizes outstanding borrowings, availability, and the average interest rate under the ABL Facility:\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nJune 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nJuly 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aggregate borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 780.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 899.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 121.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 105.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Excess availability, net of lenders' reserves\nof $12.1 and $11.2, respectively\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 854.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 594.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.52\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.59\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe ABL Facility contains covenants requiring the maintenance of a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio if excess availability falls below the greater of (i) $160.0 million and (ii) 10% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the revolving credit facility amount for five consecutive business days. The ABL Facility also contains customary restrictive covenants that include, but are not limited to, restrictions on PFGC's ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, make investments or specified payments, and dispose of assets. The ABL Facility provides for customary events of default, including payment defaults and cross-defaults on other material indebtedness. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, amounts due under such agreement may be accelerated and the rights and remedies of the lenders under the ABL Facility may be exercised, including rights with respect to the collateral securing the obligations under such agreement.\nSenior Notes: On May 17, 2016, Performance Food Group, Inc. issued and sold $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.500% Senior Notes due 2024 (the Notes\u201d), pursuant to an indenture dated as of May 17, 2016. The Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by PFGC and all domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of PFGC (other than captive insurance subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries). The Notes are not guaranteed by Performance Food Group Company.\nThe proceeds from the Notes were used to pay in full the remaining outstanding aggregate principal amount of the loans under the Company's term loan facility and to terminate the facility; to temporarily repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility; and to pay the fees, expenses, and other transaction costs incurred in connection with the Notes.\nThe Notes were issued at 100.0% of their par value. The Notes mature on June 1, 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 5.500% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears.\nUpon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event or upon the sale of certain assets in which Performance Food Group, Inc. does not apply the proceeds as required, the holders of the Notes will have the right to require Performance Food Group, Inc. to repurchase each holder's Notes at a price equal to 101% (in the case of a change of control triggering event) or 100% (in the case of an asset sale) of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Performance Food Group, Inc. may redeem all or a part of the Notes at any time prior to June 1, 2019 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. In addition, beginning on June 1, 2019, Performance Food Group, Inc. may redeem all or a part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 102.750% of the principal amount redeemed. The redemption price decreases to 101.325% and 100.000% of the principal amount redeemed on June 1, 2020 and June 1, 2021, respectively. In addition, at any time prior to June 1, 2019, Performance Food Group, Inc.\nmay redeem up to 40% of the Notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 105.500% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe indenture governing the Notes contains covenants limiting, among other things, PFGC and its restricted subsidiaries' ability to incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock; pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock; make certain investments; incur certain liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; create certain restrictions on the ability of PFGC's restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to PFGC; designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and transfer or sell certain assets. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. The Notes also contain customary events of default, the occurrence of which could result in the principal of and accrued interest on the Notes to become or be declared due and payable.\nThe ABL Facility and the indenture governing the Notes contain customary restrictive covenants under which all of the net assets of PFGC and its subsidiaries were restricted from distribution to Performance Food Group Company, except for approximately $486.0 million of restricted payment capacity available under such debt agreements, as of June 30, 2018. Such minimum estimated restricted payment capacity is calculated based on the most restrictive of our debt agreements and may fluctuate from period to period, which fluctuations may be material. Our restricted payment capacity under other debt instruments to which the Company is subject may be materially higher than the foregoing estimate.\nAs of June 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the ABL Facility and Notes.\nUnsecured Subordinated Promissory Note. In connection with an acquisition, Performance Food Group, Inc. issued a $6.0 million interest only, unsecured subordinated promissory note on December 21, 2012, bearing an interest rate of 3.5%. The $6.0 million promissory note was paid off in December 2017.\nContractual Cash Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our significant contractual cash obligations as of June 30, 2018.

During this time period, this segment increased its property, plant, and equipment and inventory, which was partially offset by a decrease in intangible assets.\nTotal assets for PFG Customized decreased $22.8 million from $667.1 million as of July 1, 2017 to $644.3 million as of June 30, 2018. During this time period, this segment decreased its accounts receivable.\nTotal assets for Vistar increased $84.5 million from $654.5 million as of July 1, 2017 to $739.0 million as of June 30, 2018. During this time period, this segment increased its accounts receivable, goodwill, and intangible assets, primarily due to acquisitions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to portraying our financial position and results of operations. These policies require our most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates include those that pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, inventory valuation, insurance programs, income taxes, vendor rebates and promotional incentives, and goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables from customers in the ordinary course of business, are recorded at the invoiced amount, and primarily do not bear interest. Receivables are recorded net of the allowance for doubtful accounts on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. We regularly analyze our significant customer accounts, and when we become aware of a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as a bankruptcy filing or a deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position, we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible. We also record reserves for bad debt for other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, macroeconomic considerations, and historical experience. If circumstances related to specific customers change, our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.\nInventory Valuation\nOur inventories consist primarily of food and non-food products. We primarily value inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method ( FIFO\u201d). FIFO was used for approximately 91% of total inventories at June 30, 2018. The remainder of the inventory was valued using LIFO method using the link chain technique of the dollar value method. We adjust our inventory balances for slow-moving, excess, and obsolete inventories. These adjustments are based upon inventory category, inventory age, specifically identified items, and overall economic conditions.\nInsurance Programs\nWe maintain high-deductible insurance programs covering portions of general and vehicle liability and workers' compensation. The amounts in excess of the deductibles are insured by third-party insurance carriers, subject to certain limitations and exclusions.\nWe also maintain self-funded group medical insurance. We accrue our estimated liability for these deductibles, including an estimate for incurred but not reported claims, based on known claims and past claims history. The estimated short-term portion of these accruals is included in Accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets, while the estimated long-term portion of the accruals is included in Other long-term liabilities. The provisions for insurance claims include estimates of the frequency and timing of claims occurrence, as well as the ultimate amounts to be paid. These insurance programs are managed by a third party, and the deductibles for general and vehicle liability and workers compensation are primarily collateralized by letters of credit and restricted cash.\nIncome Taxes\nWe follow Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 740-10, Income Taxes-Overall, which requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Future tax benefits, including net operating loss carry-forwards, are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law, and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate.\nVendor Rebates and Other Promotional Incentives\nWe participate in various rebate and promotional incentives with our suppliers, either unilaterally or in combination with purchasing cooperatives and other procurement partners, that consist primarily of volume and growth rebates, annual and multi-year incentives, and promotional programs. Consideration received under these incentives is generally recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold. However, in certain limited circumstances the consideration is recorded as a reduction of costs incurred by us. Consideration received may be in the form of cash and/or invoice deductions. Changes in the estimated amount of incentives to be received are treated as changes in estimates and are recognized in the period of change.\nConsideration received for volume and growth rebates, annual incentives, and multi-year incentives are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold. We systematically and rationally allocate the consideration for these incentives to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress by the Company toward earning the incentives. If the incentives are not probable and reasonably estimable, we record the incentives as the underlying objectives or milestones are achieved. We record annual and multi-year incentives when earned, generally over the agreement period. We use current and historical purchasing data, forecasted purchasing volumes, and other factors in estimating whether the underlying objectives or milestones will be achieved. Consideration received to promote and sell the supplier's products is typically a reimbursement of marketing costs incurred by the Company and is recorded as a reduction of our operating expenses. If the amount of consideration received from the suppliers exceeds our marketing costs, any excess is recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold. We follow the requirements of FASB ASC 605-50-25-10, Revenue Recognition-Customer Payments and Incentives-Recognition-Customer's Accounting for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor and ASC 605-50-45-16, Revenue Recognition-Customer Payments and Incentives-Other Presentation Matters-Reseller's Characterization of Sales Incentives Offered to Customers by Manufacturers.\nAcquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. Our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. Goodwill and other intangible assets represent the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts specifically assigned to those tangible net assets acquired in a business combination. Other identifiable intangible assets typically include customer relationships, trade names, technology, non-compete agreements, and favorable lease assets. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangibles with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which generally range from two to eleven years. Annually, or when certain triggering events occur, the Company assesses the useful lives of its intangibles with definite lives. Certain assumptions, estimates, and judgments are used in determining the fair value of net assets acquired, including goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the reporting units. Accordingly, we may obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position, and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\nWe are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances indicate. Indicators of goodwill impairment include, but are not limited to, significant declines in the markets and\nindustries that buy our products, changes in the estimated future cash flows of its reporting units, changes in capital markets, and changes in its market capitalization.\nWe apply the guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2011-08 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Testing Goodwill for Impairment,\u201d which provides entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment (commonly referred to as step zero\u201d) to determine whether further quantitative analysis for impairment of goodwill is necessary. In performing step zero for our goodwill impairment test, we are required to make assumptions and judgments, including but not limited to the following: the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to our business, industry and market trends, and the overall future financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate. If impairment indicators are present after performing step zero, we would perform a quantitative impairment analysis to estimate the fair value of goodwill.\nDuring fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, we performed the step zero analysis for our goodwill impairment test.

I do not have personal opinions, feelings, or preferences, so I cannot say whether I would like to go to a certain restaurant. \n\n- I cannot make reservations for you at a restaurant. However, I can provide you with information about the restaurant, such as its address, phone number, and menu. With this information, you can contact the restaurant directly and make a reservation yourself. \n\n- Here are some general tips for making restaurant reservations:\n\n- Check the restaurant's website or give them a call to find out their reservation policies and contact information. Some restaurants may have an online reservation system or a reservation hotline.\n- If you are planning to go with a large group, it is recommended to call the restaurant directly to make sure they can accommodate your group and to inquire about any special arrangements that may be needed.\n- When making a reservation, be sure to ask about any cancellation or rescheduling policies. This will help you avoid any penalties or fees if you need to make changes to your plans.\n- Make sure to arrive on time for your reservation.", "item_7_tables": "Table 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Part II, Item 6. - Selected Financial Data\u201d and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nOur Company\nWe market and distribute over 150,000 food and food-related products to customers across the United States from approximately 73 distribution facilities to over 150,000 customer locations in the food-away-from-home\u201d industry. We offer our customers a broad assortment of products including our proprietary-branded products, nationally-branded products, and products bearing our customers' brands. Our product assortment ranges from center-of-the-plate\u201d items (such as beef, pork, poultry, and seafood), frozen foods, and groceries to candy, snacks, and beverages. We also sell disposables, cleaning and kitchen supplies, and related products used by our customers. In addition to the products we offer to our customers, we provide value-added services by allowing our customers to benefit from our industry knowledge, scale, and expertise in the areas of product selection and procurement, menu development, and operational strategy.\nWe have three reportable segments: Performance Foodservice, PFG Customized, and Vistar. Our Performance Foodservice segment distributes a broad line of national brands, customer brands, and our proprietary-branded food and food-related products, or Performance Brands.\u201d Performance Foodservice sells to independent, or Street,\u201d and multi-unit, or Chain,\u201d restaurants and other institutions such as schools, healthcare facilities, and business and industry locations. Our PFG Customized segment has provided longstanding service to some of the most recognizable family and casual dining restaurant chains and recently expanded service into fast casual and quick service restaurant chains. Our Vistar segment specializes in distributing candy, snacks, beverages, and other items nationally to the vending, office coffee service, theater, retail, hospitality, and other channels. We believe that there are substantial synergies across our segments. Cross-segment synergies include procurement, operational best practices such as the use of new productivity technologies, and supply chain and network optimization, as well as shared corporate functions such as accounting, treasury, tax, legal, information systems, and human resources.\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 52-week year for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 and a 53-week year for fiscal 2016. References to fiscal 2018\u201d are to the 52-week period ended June 30, 2018, references to fiscal 2017\u201d are to the 52-week period ended July 1, 2017, and references to fiscal 2016\u201d are to the 53-week period ended July 2, 2016.\nRecent Trends and Initiatives\nOur case volume has grown in each quarter over the comparable prior fiscal year quarter, starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 and continuing through the most recent quarter. We believe that we gained industry share during fiscal 2018 given that we have grown our sales more rapidly than the industry growth rate forecasted by Technomic, a research and consulting firm serving the food and food related industry. Our Net income increased 106.3% and Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.2% from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018, primarily driven by case growth and improved gross margin. Case volume grew 3.0% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Gross profit dollars rose 7.9% in fiscal 2018 versus the prior year, which was faster than case growth, primarily as a result of shifting our channel mix toward higher gross margin customers and shifting our product mix toward sales of Performance Brands. Our operating expenses in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 rose 6.6% as a result of increases in variable operational and selling expenses associated with the increase in case volume, as well as an increase in fuel expense and investments in selling, warehouse, and delivery personnel.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Business\nWe believe that our performance is principally affected by the following key factors:\n \u2022 Changing demographic and macroeconomic trends. The share of consumer spending captured by the food-away-from-home industry increased steadily for several decades and paused during the recession that began in 2008. Following the recession, the share has again increased as a result of increasing employment, rising disposable income, increases in the number of restaurants, and favorable demographic trends, such as smaller household sizes, an increasing number of dual income households, and an aging population base that spends more per capita at foodservice establishments. The \n foodservice distribution industry is also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions, such as changes in consumer spending, changes in consumer confidence, and changes in the prices of certain goods. \n \u2022 Food distribution market structure. The food distribution market consists of a wide spectrum of companies ranging from businesses selling a single category of product (e.g., produce) to large national and regional broadline distributors with many distribution centers and thousands of products across all categories. We believe our scale enables us to invest in our Performance Brands, to benefit from economies of scale in purchasing and procurement, and to drive supply chain efficiencies that enhance our customers' satisfaction and profitability. We believe that the relative growth of larger foodservice distributors will continue to outpace that of smaller, independent players in our industry. \n \u2022 Our ability to successfully execute our segment strategies and implement our initiatives. Our performance will continue to depend on our ability to successfully execute our segment strategies and to implement our current and future initiatives. The key strategies include focusing on independent sales and Performance Brands, pursuing new customers for all three of our reportable segments, expansion of geographies, utilizing our infrastructure to gain further operating and purchasing efficiencies, and making strategic acquisitions. \nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures used by our management are discussed below. The percentages on the results presented below are calculated based on rounded numbers.\nNet Sales\nNet sales is equal to gross sales minus sales returns; sales incentives that we offer to our customers, such as rebates and discounts that are offsets to gross sales; and certain other adjustments. Our net sales are driven by changes in case volumes, product inflation that is reflected in the pricing of our products, and mix of products sold.\nGross Profit\nGross profit is equal to our net sales minus our cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold primarily includes inventory costs (net of supplier consideration) and inbound freight. Cost of goods sold generally changes as we incur higher or lower costs from our suppliers and as our customer and product mix changes.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nManagement measures operating performance based on our EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) and is not a measure of operating income, operating performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is subject to important limitations. Our definition of EBITDA may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDA enhances an investor's understanding of our performance. We use this measure to evaluate the performance of our segments and for business planning purposes. We present EBITDA in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, and such information is not meant to replace or supersede U.S. GAAP measures.\nIn addition, our management uses Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income and franchise taxes, and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude certain items that we do not consider part of our core operating results. Such adjustments include certain unusual, non-cash, non-recurring, cost reduction, and other adjustment items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under our credit agreement and indenture (other than certain pro forma adjustments permitted under our credit agreement and indenture relating to the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of acquired entities or businesses prior to the acquisition date). Under our credit agreement and indenture, our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness, making certain investments, and making restricted payments is tied to ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement and indenture). Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not defined under U.S. GAAP and is subject to important limitations. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties, including our lenders under the ABL Facility and holders of our Notes (as defined below under -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d), in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies in industries similar to ours. In addition, targets based on Adjusted EBITDA are among the measures we use to evaluate our management's performance for purposes of determining their compensation under our incentive plans.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. For example, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n \u2022 exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; \n \u2022 do not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; \n \u2022 do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and \n \u2022 do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service our debt. \nIn calculating Adjusted EBITDA, we add back certain non-cash, non-recurring, and other items as permitted or required by our credit agreement and indenture. Adjusted EBITDA among other things:\n \u2022 does not include non-cash stock-based employee compensation expense and certain other non-cash charges; \n \u2022 does not include cash and non-cash restructuring, severance, and relocation costs incurred to realize future cost savings and enhance our operations; and \n \u2022 does not reflect management fees paid to Blackstone and Wellspring. \nWe have included the calculations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented.\nResults of Operations, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our results of operations, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated (dollars in millions, except per share data):\n\nWe believe that the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is net income. The following table reconciles EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income for the periods presented:\n\n (1) Includes a $9.4 million loss on extinguishment and $5.5 million of accelerated amortization of original issuance discount and deferred financing costs during fiscal 2016. \n (2) Includes adjustments for non-cash charges arising from stock-based compensation, interest rate swap hedge ineffectiveness, and gain/loss on disposal of assets. Stock-based compensation cost was $21.6 million, $17.3 million and $17.2 million for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. In addition, this includes an increase (decrease) in the last-in, first-out ( LIFO\u201d) reserve of $0.3 million, $2.6 million and $(1.5) million for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016, respectively. \n (3) Includes professional fees and other costs related to completed and abandoned acquisitions, costs of integrating certain of our facilities, facility closing costs, advisory fees and offering fees. \n (4) Consists primarily of an expense related to our withdrawal from a purchasing cooperative of which we were a member, pre-acquisition worker's compensation claims related to an insurance company that went into liquidation, and amounts received from business interruption insurance because of a weather-related event. \n (5) Consists primarily of professional fees and related expenses associated with productivity initiatives. \n (6) Consists primarily of amounts related to fuel collar derivatives, certain financing transactions, lease amendments, and franchise tax expense and other adjustments permitted by our credit agreement. \nConsolidated Results of Operations\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017\nNet Sales\nNet sales growth is primarily a function of case growth, pricing (which is primarily based on product inflation/deflation), and a changing mix of customers, channels, and product categories sold. Net sales increased $858.1 million, or 5.1%, in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to sales growth in Vistar, particularly in the theater and retail channels, case growth in Performance Foodservice, particularly in the independent channel, and recent acquisitions. Case volume increased 3.0% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased $168.0 million, or 7.9%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 13.0% for fiscal 2018 compared to 12.7% for fiscal 2017. The increase in gross profit was the result of growth in cases sold and a higher gross profit per case, which in turn was the result of selling an improved mix of channels and products. Within Performance Foodservice, case growth to independent customers positively affected gross profit per case. Independent customers typically receive more services from us, cost more to serve, and pay a higher gross profit per case than other customers. Also, in fiscal 2018, Performance Foodservice grew our Performance Brand sales, which have higher gross profit per case compared to the other brands we sell. See -Segment Results-Performance Foodservice\u201d below for additional discussion.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased $125.5 million, or 6.6%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the increase in acquired case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses, as well as investments in selling, warehouse, and delivery personnel. Operating expenses also increased in fiscal 2018 as a result of increases in fuel expense of $15.7 million and stock-based compensation expense of $4.3 million, partially offset by a $2.6 million decrease in advisory fees and a $1.8 million decrease in professional fees.\nDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased from $126.1 million in fiscal 2017 to $130.1 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of 3.2%. Depreciation of fixed assets increased as a result of capital outlays to support our growth, as well as recent acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by decreases in amortization since certain intangibles are now fully amortized compared to the prior year.\nNet Income\nNet income increased by $102.4 million, or 106.3%, to $198.7 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in net income was attributable to the $42.5 million increase in operating profit and the $66.5 million decrease in income tax expense, partially offset by a $5.5 million increase in interest expense, and a $1.1 million decrease in other income.\nThe increase in operating profit was a result of the increase in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in the average interest rate and higher average borrowings during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The $1.1 million decrease in other income related primarily to derivative activity.\nThe decrease in income tax expense was primarily a result of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d). Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 was -2.6% compared to 39.0% in fiscal 2017. The Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Among its numerous changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate rate from 35% to 21%, which resulted in a blended U.S. federal statutory rate of approximately 28% for fiscal 2018 for the Company. As a result of the Act, the Company revalued its net deferred tax liability, resulting in a decrease to the net deferred tax liability of $38.5 million with a corresponding net benefit to income tax expense for fiscal 2018. As a result of a blended statutory rate for fiscal 2018, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $11.9 million for the rate differential related to temporary differences. Additionally, in fiscal 2018, performance vesting criteria for certain stock-based compensation awards was met resulting in an excess tax benefit of $15.4 million.\nFiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales growth is primarily a function of case growth, pricing (which is primarily based on product inflation/deflation), and a changing mix of customers, channels, and product categories sold. Net sales increased $657.0 million, or 4.1%, in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to case growth in Performance Foodservice, particularly in the independent channel, and sales growth in Vistar, particularly in the retail, theater, vending, and hospitality channels partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal year 2016. Net sales for the extra week in fiscal 2016 were approximately $312.4 million. Net sales growth was driven by case volume growth of 4.1% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, case volume increased 6.2% compared to the prior year.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased $114.8 million, or 5.7%, for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in gross profit was the result of growth in cases sold and a higher gross profit per case, which in turn was the result of selling an improved mix of channels and products, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. Within Performance Foodservice, case growth to independent customers positively affected gross profit per case. Independent customers typically receive more services from us, cost more to serve, and pay a higher gross profit per case than other customers. Also, in fiscal 2017, Performance Foodservice grew our Performance Brand sales, which have higher gross profit per case compared to the other brands we sell. See -Segment Results-Performance Foodservice\u201d below for additional discussion. The Company estimates that the gross profit for the extra week in fiscal 2016 was approximately $40.1 million.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased $106.0 million, or 5.9%, for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the increase in case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses, as well as investments associated with expansion of geographies served in the dollar store channel, transition of business within PFG Customized and the opening of our automated retail facility within the Vistar segment. Additionally, operating expenses increased for fiscal year 2017 as a result of an $8.4 million increase in insurance expense primarily related to workers compensation and professional and legal fees including settlements of $3.0 million. The increase was partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. Operating expenses for the extra week is fiscal 2016 were approximately $35.3 million.\nDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased from $118.6 million in fiscal 2016 to $126.1 million in fiscal 2017, an increase of 6.3%. Depreciation of fixed assets increased as a result of larger capital outlays to support our growth, as well as recent acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by decreases in amortization since certain intangibles are now fully amortized compared to the prior year.\nNet Income\nNet income increased by $28.0 million, or 41.0%, to $96.3 million for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in net income was attributable to an $8.8 million increase in operating profit, a $29.0 million decrease in interest expense, and a $5.4 million decrease in other expense, partially offset by a $15.2 million increase in income tax expense. The Company estimates that net income for the extra week in fiscal 2016 was approximately $2.1 million.\nThe increase in operating profit was a result of the increase in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses. The decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of lower average interest rates during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and a $9.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt and $5.5 million of accelerated amortization of original issuance discount and deferred financing costs in fiscal 2016.\nThe $5.4 million decrease in other expense related primarily to a $4.7 million decrease in expense related to settlements on our derivatives and a $2.0 million increase in income from hedge ineffectiveness in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. These increases were partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in non-cash income primarily related to the change in fair value of our derivatives for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.\nThe increase in income tax expense was primarily a result of the increase in income before taxes, partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was 39.0% compared to 40.3% in fiscal 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate was a result of an increase in other permanent deductions and a reduction in non-deductible expenses and state income tax as a percentage of income before taxes. Since non-deductible expenses tend to be relatively constant, there is a favorable rate impact as income before taxes increases.\nSegment Results\nWe have three reportable segments as described above-Performance Foodservice, PFG Customized, and Vistar. Management evaluates the performance of these segments based on their respective sales growth and EBITDA. For PFG Customized, EBITDA includes certain allocated corporate expenses that are included in operating expenses. The allocated corporate expenses are determined based on a percentage of total sales. This percentage is reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that the allocation reflects a reasonable rate of corporate expenses based on their use of corporate services.\nCorporate & All Other is comprised of unallocated corporate overhead and certain operations that are not considered separate reportable segments based on their size. This includes the operations of our internal logistics unit responsible for managing and allocating inbound logistics revenue and expense, as well as the operations of certain recent acquisitions.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company reorganized its information technology department, and expenses associated with business application teams are now included in the segment results. The EBITDA for Performance Foodservice, Vistar and Corporate & All Other for the fiscal years ended July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016 have been adjusted to reflect this change.\nThe following tables set forth net sales and EBITDA by segment for the periods indicated (dollars in millions):\nNet Sales\n\nEBITDA\n\nSegment Results-Performance Foodservice\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017\nNet Sales\nNet sales for Performance Foodservice increased $608.8 million, or 6.2%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. The increase in net sales was attributable to growth in cases sold, as well as an increase in selling price per case as a result of inflation. Case growth in fiscal 2018 was driven by securing new independent customers and further penetrating existing customers. Securing new and expanded business with independent customers resulted in independent sales growth of approximately 8.4% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2018, independent sales as a percentage of total segment sales were 45.2%.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for Performance Foodservice increased $10.6 million, or 3.3%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. This increase was the result of an increase in gross profit, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Gross profit increased by 6.0% in fiscal 2018, compared to the prior fiscal year, as a result of an increase in cases sold, as well as an increase in the gross profit per case. The increase in gross profit per case was driven by a favorable shift in the mix of cases sold toward independent customers and Performance Brands, as well as by an increase in procurement gains. Independent business has higher gross margins than Chain customers within this segment.\nOperating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization for Performance Foodservice increased by $77.1 million, or 6.8%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. Operating expenses increased as a result of an increase in case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses, as well as investments in selling, warehouse, and delivery personnel. Operating expenses also increased as a result of a $10.3 million increase in fuel expense, which mostly occurred in the second half of fiscal 2018.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $57.4 million in fiscal 2017 to $58.7 million in fiscal 2018. This increase was a result of recent acquisitions, computer software, capital leases and warehouse expansion, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets since certain intangibles are now fully amortized.\nFiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales for Performance Foodservice increased $206.1 million, or 2.1%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. This increase in net sales was attributable to growth in cases sold, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. Net sales for the extra week in fiscal 2016 were approximately $188.0 million. Case growth in fiscal 2017 was driven by securing new independent customers and further penetrating existing customers. Securing new and expanded business with independent customers resulted in independent sales growth of approximately 4.6% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2017, independent sales as a percentage of total segment sales were 44.4%.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for Performance Foodservice increased $16.8 million, or 5.5%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. This increase was the result of an increase in gross profit, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization. Gross profit increased by 4.4% in fiscal 2017, compared to the prior fiscal year, as a result of an increase in cases sold, as well as an increase in the gross profit per case, partially offset by gross profit of approximately $28.3 million in the extra week in fiscal 2016. The increase in gross profit per case was driven by a favorable shift in the mix of cases sold toward independent customers and Performance Brands, as well as by an increase in procurement gains. Independent business has higher gross margins than Chain customers within this segment.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for Performance Foodservice increased by $45.3 million, or 4.1%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. Operating expenses increased as a result of an increase in case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses, as well as cost of living and other increases in compensation and benefits and increase in costs associated with insurance expense primarily related to workers' compensation and vehicle liability of $5.9 million. These increases were partially offset by the extra week in fiscal 2016. The Company estimates that operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization were approximately $21.2 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2016.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment decreased from $63.2 million in fiscal 2016 to $57.4 million in fiscal 2017, a decrease of 9.2%. These reductions were a result of a decrease in amortization of intangible assets since certain intangibles are now fully amortized.\nSegment Results-PFG Customized\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017\nNet Sales\nNet sales for PFG Customized decreased $162.3 million, or 4.2%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. The decrease in net sales was primarily a result of the Georgia facility that was closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding the impact of the closed Georgia facility, net sales would have increased $65.0 million in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year as a result of an increase in selling price per case driven by a favorable shift in customer mix.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for PFG Customized increased $4.2 million, or 16.6%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of the closed Georgia facility, an increase in gross profit was offset by an increase in operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization. Gross profit for PFG Customized increased primarily as a result of a favorable shift in customer mix.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased by $9.4 million, or 4.5%, in fiscal 2018, compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the closed Georgia facility, partially offset by increases in personnel expenses and fuel expense.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment decreased from $16.1 million in fiscal 2017 to $14.6 million in fiscal 2018. This decrease is primarily a result of lower amortization expense for certain customer relationship intangible assets, which are now fully amortized.\nFiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales for PFG Customized increased $38.7 million, or 1.0%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales was driven by the new business with Red Lobster in fiscal 2017, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. Net sales for the extra week in fiscal 2016 were approximately $70.2 million.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for PFG Customized decreased $8.8 million, or 25.8%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in gross profit of $5.1 million, or 2.1%, and an increase in operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization. Gross profit for PFG Customized decreased primarily as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 and planned exits of some customers to free up capacity for the addition of the new business with Red Lobster. The Company estimates that gross profit was approximately $4.4 million for the extra week in fiscal 2016. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we began providing distribution solutions to a portion of Red Lobster's restaurants and completed the transition during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased by $3.7 million, or 1.8%, in fiscal 2017, compared to the prior year primarily driven by $5.2 million related to the closing of the Georgia facility, partially offset by $3.8 million of expense in the 53rd week in fiscal 2016.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $15.4 million in fiscal 2016 to $16.1 million in fiscal 2017, an increase of 4.5%. The increase was primarily a result of the accelerated amortization of customer relationship intangible assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 due to volume declines for certain customers.\nSegment Results-Vistar\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017\nNet Sales\nNet sales for Vistar increased $337.4 million, or 11.2%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. This increase was driven by case sales growth in the segment's theater and retail channels, as well as recent acquisitions.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for Vistar increased $15.4 million, or 13.1%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. Gross profit dollar growth of $72.5 million, or 18.4% for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, was driven by an increase in the number of cases sold, as well as an increase in gross profit per case. The increase in gross profit per case was driven by a favorable shift in channel mix, as well as by an increase in procurement gains.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $57.7 million, or 20.9%, for fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year. Operating expenses increased primarily as a result of an increase in case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses, as well as cost of living and other increases in compensation and benefits.

This increase was driven by case sales growth in the segment's retail, theater, vending, and hospitality channels and recent acquisitions, partially offset by net sales of approximately $54.1 million in the 53rd week in fiscal 2016.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for Vistar increased $7.6 million, or 6.9%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. This increase in EBITDA was the result of gross profit dollar growth increasing faster than operating expense dollar growth, excluding depreciation and amortization. Gross profit dollar growth of $39.2 million, or 11.0% for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, was driven by an increase in the number of cases sold and recent acquisitions, partially offset by gross profit of approximately $7.0 million in the 53rd week in fiscal 2016.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $30.9 million, or 12.6%, for fiscal 2017. Operating expenses increased primarily as a result of investments associated with expansion of geographies served in the dollar store channel, additional expenses related to recent acquisitions and an increase associated with the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 opening of our automated retail facility, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. The Company estimates that operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization were approximately $4.9 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2016.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $18.2 million in fiscal 2016 to $24.6 million in fiscal 2017, an increase of 35.2%.

The improvement in EBITDA was primarily driven by contributions from recent acquisitions and decreases in professional and other services fees of $4.5 million, personnel expenses of $4.4 million, advisory fees of $2.6 million, and insurance of $2.3 million, partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $4.3 million.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $28.0 million in fiscal 2017 to $29.4 million in fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily a result of amortization related to recent acquisitions.\nFiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales for Corporate & All Other increased $127.3 million from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to recent acquisitions and an increase in logistics services provided to our other segments, partially offset by net sales of approximately $4.4 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2016.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for Corporate & All Other was a negative $124.3 million for fiscal 2017 compared to a negative $130.4 million for fiscal 2016. The improvement in EBITDA was primarily driven by recent acquisitions and a $5.5 million decrease in other expenses related to derivative activity, partially offset by an increase in personnel expenses and a $0.8 million increase in professional and legal fees including settlements.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $21.8 million in fiscal 2016 to $28.0 million in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily a result of amortization related to recent acquisitions.\nQuarterly Results and Seasonality\nHistorically, the food-away-from-home and foodservice distribution industries are seasonal, with lower profit in the first and third quarters of each calendar year. Consequently, we typically experience lower operating profit during our first and third fiscal quarters, depending on the timing of acquisitions, if any.\nFinancial information for each quarter of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 is set forth below:\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have historically financed our operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, operating and capital leases, and normal trade credit terms. We have typically funded our acquisitions with additional borrowings under our credit facility. Our working capital and borrowing levels are subject to seasonal fluctuations, typically with the lowest borrowing levels in the third and fourth fiscal quarters and the highest borrowing levels occurring in the first and second fiscal quarters. We believe that our cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient both to meet our anticipated cash requirements over at least the next 12 months and to maintain sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes.\nAt June 30, 2018, our cash balance totaled $17.8 million, including restricted cash of $10.3 million, as compared to a cash balance totaling $21.0 million, including restricted cash of $12.9 million, at July 1, 2017. This decrease in cash during fiscal 2018 was attributable to net cash used in investing activities and financing activities of $209.4 million and $160.8 million, respectively, which was partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities of $367.0 million. We borrow under the ABL Facility or pay it down regularly based on our cash flows from operating and investing activities. Our practice is to minimize interest expense while maintaining reasonable liquidity.\nAs market conditions warrant, we may from time to time seek to repurchase our securities or loans in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Any such repurchases may be funded by incurring new debt, including additional borrowings under our ABL Facility. In addition, depending on conditions in the credit and capital markets and other factors, we will, from time to time, consider other financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance our indebtedness, make investments or acquisitions or for other purposes. Any new debt may be secured debt.\nOn October 6, 2015, we completed our initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) of 16,675,000 shares of common stock for an offering price of $19.00 per share ($17.955 per share net of underwriting discounts), including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. We sold an aggregate of 12,777,325 shares of such common stock and certain selling stockholders sold 3,897,675 shares. The aggregate offering price of the amount of newly issued common stock was $242.8 million. In connection with the offering, we paid the underwriters a discount of $1.045 per share, for a total underwriting discount of $13.4 million. In addition, we incurred direct offering expenses consisting of legal, accounting, and printing costs of $5.8 million in connection with the IPO, of which $3.0 million was paid during fiscal 2016. We used the net proceeds to us from the IPO after deducting the underwriting discount and our direct offering expenses to repay $223.0 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under a credit agreement providing for a term loan facility (the Term Facility\u201d). We used the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nOn February 1, 2016, Performance Food Group, Inc. amended and restated the ABL Facility to increase the aggregate principal amount from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, lower interest rates for LIBOR based loans, extend the maturity from May 2017 to February 2021, and modify triggers and provisions related to certain reporting, financial, and negative covenants. The total size of the facility immediately increased the effective borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility since borrowing base assets exceeded the facility size prior to the amendment. Approximately $6.8 million of fees and expenses were incurred for the amendment, which were included as deferred financing costs and will be amortized over the remaining term of the ABL Facility. Of this amount, $6.6 million was paid during fiscal 2016. In connection with the closing of this amendment, Performance Food Group, Inc. borrowed $200.0 million under the ABL Facility and used the proceeds to repay $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of loans under the Term Facility.\nOn May 17, 2016, Performance Food Group, Inc. issued and sold $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.500% Senior Notes due 2024 (the Notes\u201d), pursuant to an indenture dated as of May 17, 2016, that is jointly and severally guaranteed by PFGC, Inc. ( PFGC\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and all domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of PFGC (other than captive insurance subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries). The proceeds from the Notes were used to pay in full the remaining outstanding $306.4 million aggregate principal amount of loans under the Term Facility and to terminate the Term Facility; to temporarily repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility; and to pay the fees, expenses, and other transaction costs incurred in connection with the Notes. Approximately $7.2 million of fees and expenses were incurred and paid during fiscal 2016 in connection with the Notes. Of the amount of fees incurred, $2.5 was included as deferred financing costs and will be amortized over the remaining term of the Notes, $2.1 million was included in loss on extinguishment of debt within interest expense related to the portion of the Term Facility repayment deemed an extinguishment, and $2.6 million was recorded to Operating expenses for the portion of the Term Facility deemed a modification.\nOn August 3, 2017, PFGC, Inc. and Performance Food Group, Inc., each a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into the First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amendment\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and the other lenders party thereto, which amended the ABL Facility. The Amendment amended the ABL Facility by, among other things, (i) increasing the aggregate principal amount under the ABL Facility from $1.6 billion to $1.95 billion by increasing Tranche A Commitments by $325.0 million and the Tranche A-1 Commitments by\n$25.0 million and (ii) maintaining the level of additional commitments permitted, excluding the additional commitments effected pursuant to the Amendment, at $800.0 million under uncommitted incremental facilities.\nOperating Activities\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017\nDuring fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, our operating activities provided cash flow of $367.0 million and $201.7 million, respectively. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was largely driven by higher operating income, improved working capital management and lower taxes paid.\nFiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016\nDuring fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, our operating activities provided cash flow of $201.7 million and $228.5 million, respectively.\nFiscal 2016 cash flows provided by operating activities included a $25.0 million break-up fee payment received related to the terminated agreement to acquire 11 US Foods facilities from Sysco and US Foods. Excluding this fee, cash flows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2016 were $203.5 million. The remaining $1.8 million decrease, excluding the break-up fee payment, in cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was largely driven by an increase in our net working capital investment, partially offset by lower cash income tax payments as a result of timing of the payments and lower cash interest payments as a result of debt pay down associated with the IPO and subsequent refinancings, as well as changes in the timing of payments. Our net working capital, which includes accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and outstanding checks in excess of deposits, fluctuates with our sales growth.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities totaled $209.4 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $332.0 million in fiscal 2017 and $157.6 million in fiscal 2016. These investments consisted primarily of capital purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $140.1 million, $140.2 million and $119.7 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and payments for business acquisitions of $71.1 million, $192.9 million and $39.0 million for fiscal years 2018,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Our Performance Foodservice segment distributes a broad line of national brands, customer brands, and our proprietary-branded food and food-related products, or Performance Brands.\u201d Performance Foodservice sells to independent, or Street,\u201d and multi-unit, or Chain,\u201d restaurants and other institutions such as schools, healthcare facilities, and business and industry locations. Our PFG Customized segment has provided longstanding service to some of the most recognizable family and casual dining restaurant chains and recently expanded service into fast casual and quick service restaurant chains. Our Vistar segment specializes in distributing candy, snacks, beverages, and other items nationally to the vending, office coffee service, theater, retail, hospitality, and other channels. We believe that there are substantial synergies across our segments. Cross-segment synergies include procurement, operational best practices such as the use of new productivity technologies, and supply chain and network optimization, as well as shared corporate functions such as accounting, treasury, tax, legal, information systems, and human resources.\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 52-week year for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 and a 53-week year for fiscal 2016. References to fiscal 2018\u201d are to the 52-week period ended June 30, 2018, references to fiscal 2017\u201d are to the 52-week period ended July 1, 2017, and references to fiscal 2016\u201d are to the 53-week period ended July 2, 2016.\nRecent Trends and Initiatives\nOur case volume has grown in each quarter over the comparable prior fiscal year quarter, starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 and continuing through the most recent quarter. We believe that we gained industry share during fiscal 2018 given that we have grown our sales more rapidly than the industry growth rate forecasted by Technomic, a research and consulting firm serving the food and food related industry. Our Net income increased 106.3% and Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.2% from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018, primarily driven by case growth and improved gross margin. Case volume grew 3.0% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Gross profit dollars rose 7.9% in fiscal 2018 versus the prior year, which was faster than case growth, primarily as a result of shifting our channel mix toward higher gross margin customers and shifting our product mix toward sales of Performance Brands. Our operating expenses in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 rose 6.6% as a result of increases in variable operational and selling expenses associated with the increase in case volume, as well as an increase in fuel expense and investments in selling, warehouse, and delivery personnel.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Business\nWe believe that our performance is principally affected by the following key factors:\n \u2022 Changing demographic and macroeconomic trends. The share of consumer spending captured by the food-away-from-home industry increased steadily for several decades and paused during the recession that began in 2008. Following the recession, the share has again increased as a result of increasing employment, rising disposable income, increases in the number of restaurants, and favorable demographic trends, such as smaller household sizes, an increasing number of dual income households, and an aging population base that spends more per capita at foodservice establishments. The \n foodservice distribution industry is also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions, such as changes in consumer spending, changes in consumer confidence, and changes in the prices of certain goods. \n \u2022 Food distribution market structure. The food distribution market consists of a wide spectrum of companies ranging from businesses selling a single category of product (e.g., produce) to large national and regional broadline distributors with many distribution centers and thousands of products across all categories. We believe our scale enables us to invest in our Performance Brands, to benefit from economies of scale in purchasing and procurement, and to drive supply chain efficiencies that enhance our customers' satisfaction and profitability. We believe that the relative growth of larger foodservice distributors will continue to outpace that of smaller, independent players in our industry. \n \u2022 Our ability to successfully execute our segment strategies and implement our initiatives. Our performance will continue to depend on our ability to successfully execute our segment strategies and to implement our current and future initiatives. The key strategies include focusing on independent sales and Performance Brands, pursuing new customers for all three of our reportable segments, expansion of geographies, utilizing our infrastructure to gain further operating and purchasing efficiencies, and making strategic acquisitions. \nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures used by our management are discussed below. The percentages on the results presented below are calculated based on rounded numbers.\nNet Sales\nNet sales is equal to gross sales minus sales returns; sales incentives that we offer to our customers, such as rebates and discounts that are offsets to gross sales; and certain other adjustments. Our net sales are driven by changes in case volumes, product inflation that is reflected in the pricing of our products, and mix of products sold.\nGross Profit\nGross profit is equal to our net sales minus our cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold primarily includes inventory costs (net of supplier consideration) and inbound freight. Cost of goods sold generally changes as we incur higher or lower costs from our suppliers and as our customer and product mix changes.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nManagement measures operating performance based on our EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) and is not a measure of operating income, operating performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is subject to important limitations. Our definition of EBITDA may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDA enhances an investor's understanding of our performance. We use this measure to evaluate the performance of our segments and for business planning purposes. We present EBITDA in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, and such information is not meant to replace or supersede U.S. GAAP measures.\nIn addition, our management uses Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income and franchise taxes, and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude certain items that we do not consider part of our core operating results. Such adjustments include certain unusual, non-cash, non-recurring, cost reduction, and other adjustment items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under our credit agreement and indenture (other than certain pro forma adjustments permitted under our credit agreement and indenture relating to the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of acquired entities or businesses prior to the acquisition date). Under our credit agreement and indenture, our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness, making certain investments, and making restricted payments is tied to ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement and indenture). Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not defined under U.S. GAAP and is subject to important limitations. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties, including our lenders under the ABL Facility and holders of our Notes (as defined below under -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d), in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies in industries similar to ours. In addition, targets based on Adjusted EBITDA are among the measures we use to evaluate our management's performance for purposes of determining their compensation under our incentive plans.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. For example, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n \u2022 exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; \n \u2022 do not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; \n \u2022 do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and \n \u2022 do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service our debt. \nIn calculating Adjusted EBITDA, we add back certain non-cash, non-recurring, and other items as permitted or required by our credit agreement and indenture. Adjusted EBITDA among other things:\n \u2022 does not include non-cash stock-based employee compensation expense and certain other non-cash charges; \n \u2022 does not include cash and non-cash restructuring, severance, and relocation costs incurred to realize future cost savings and enhance our operations; and \n \u2022 does not reflect management fees paid to Blackstone and Wellspring. \nWe have included the calculations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented.\nResults of Operations, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our

Net sales increased $858.1 million, or 5.1%, in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to sales growth in Vistar, particularly in the theater and retail channels, case growth in Performance Foodservice, particularly in the independent channel, and recent acquisitions. Case volume increased 3.0% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased $168.0 million, or 7.9%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 13.0% for fiscal 2018 compared to 12.7% for fiscal 2017. The increase in gross profit was the result of growth in cases sold and a higher gross profit per case, which in turn was the result of selling an improved mix of channels and products. Within Performance Foodservice, case growth to independent customers positively affected gross profit per case. Independent customers typically receive more services from us, cost more to serve, and pay a higher gross profit per case than other customers. Also, in fiscal 2018, Performance Foodservice grew our Performance Brand sales, which have higher gross profit per case compared to the other brands we sell. See -Segment Results-Performance Foodservice\u201d below for additional discussion.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased $125.5 million, or 6.6%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the increase in acquired case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses, as well as investments in selling, warehouse, and delivery personnel. Operating expenses also increased in fiscal 2018 as a result of increases in fuel expense of $15.7 million and stock-based compensation expense of $4.3 million, partially offset by a $2.6 million decrease in advisory fees and a $1.8 million decrease in professional fees.\nDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased from $126.1 million in fiscal 2017 to $130.1 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of 3.2%. Depreciation of fixed assets increased as a result of capital outlays to support our growth, as well as recent acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by decreases in amortization since certain intangibles are now fully amortized compared to the prior year.\nNet Income\nNet income increased by $102.4 million, or 106.3%, to $198.7 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in net income was attributable to the $42.5 million increase in operating profit and the $66.5 million decrease in income tax expense, partially offset by a $5.5 million increase in interest expense, and a $1.1 million decrease in other income.\nThe increase in operating profit was a result of the increase in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in the average interest rate and higher average borrowings during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The $1.1 million decrease in other income related primarily to derivative activity.\nThe decrease in income tax expense was primarily a result of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d). Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 was -2.6% compared to 39.0% in fiscal 2017. The Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Among its numerous changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate rate from 35% to 21%, which resulted in a blended U.S. federal statutory rate of approximately 28% for fiscal 2018 for the Company. As a result of the Act, the Company revalued its net deferred tax liability, resulting in a decrease to the net deferred tax liability of $38.5 million with a corresponding net benefit to income tax expense for fiscal 2018. As a result of a blended statutory rate for fiscal 2018, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $11.9 million for the rate differential related to temporary differences. Additionally, in fiscal 2018, performance vesting criteria for certain stock-based compensation awards was met resulting in an excess tax benefit of $15.4 million.\nFiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales growth is primarily a function of case growth, pricing (which is primarily based on product inflation/deflation), and a changing mix of customers, channels, and product categories sold. Net sales increased $657.0 million, or 4.1%, in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to case growth in Performance Foodservice, particularly in the independent channel, and sales growth in Vistar, particularly in the retail, theater, vending, and hospitality channels partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal year 2016. Net sales for the extra week in fiscal 2016 were approximately $312.4 million. Net sales growth was driven by case volume growth of 4.1% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, case volume increased 6.2% compared to the prior year.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased $114.8 million, or 5.7%, for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in gross profit was the result of growth in cases sold and a higher gross profit per case, which in turn was the result of selling an improved mix of channels and products, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. Within Performance Foodservice, case growth to independent customers positively affected gross profit per case. Independent customers typically receive more services from us, cost more to serve, and pay a higher gross profit per case than other customers. Also, in fiscal 2017, Performance Foodservice grew our Performance Brand sales, which have higher gross profit per case compared to the other brands we sell. See -Segment Results-Performance Foodservice\u201d below for additional discussion. The Company estimates that the gross profit for the extra week in fiscal 2016 was approximately $40.1 million.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased $106.0 million, or 5.9%, for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the increase in case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses, as well as investments associated with expansion of geographies served in the dollar store channel, transition of business within PFG Customized and the opening of our automated retail facility within the Vistar segment. Additionally, operating expenses increased for fiscal year 2017 as a result of an $8.4 million increase in insurance expense primarily related to workers compensation and professional and legal fees including settlements of $3.0 million. The increase was partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. Operating expenses for the extra week is fiscal 2016 were approximately $35.3 million.\nDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased from $118.6 million in fiscal 2016 to $126.1 million in fiscal 2017, an increase of 6.3%. Depreciation of fixed assets increased as a result of larger capital outlays to support our growth, as well as recent acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by decreases in amortization since certain intangibles are now fully amortized compared to the prior year.\nNet Income\nNet income increased by $28.0 million, or 41.0%, to $96.3 million for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in net income was attributable to an $8.8 million increase in operating profit, a $29.0 million decrease in interest expense, and a $5.4 million decrease in other expense, partially offset by a $15.2 million increase in income tax expense. The Company estimates that net income for the extra week in fiscal 2016 was approximately $2.1 million.\nThe increase in operating profit was a result of the increase in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses. The decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of lower average interest rates during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and a $9.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt and $5.5 million of accelerated amortization of original issuance discount and deferred financing costs in fiscal 2016.\nThe $5.4 million decrease in other expense related primarily to a $4.7 million decrease in expense related to settlements on our derivatives and a $2.0 million increase in income from hedge ineffectiveness in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. These increases were partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in non-cash income primarily related to the change in fair value of our derivatives for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.\nThe increase in income tax expense was primarily a result of the increase in income before taxes, partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was 39.0% compared to 40.3% in fiscal 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate was a result of an increase in other permanent deductions and a reduction in non-deductible expenses and state income tax as a percentage of income before taxes. Since non-deductible expenses tend to be relatively constant, there is a favorable rate impact as income before taxes increases.\nSegment Results\nWe have three reportable segments as described above-Performance Foodservice, PFG Customized, and Vistar. Management evaluates the performance of these segments based on their respective sales growth and EBITDA. For PFG Customized, EBITDA includes certain allocated corporate expenses that are included in operating expenses. The allocated corporate expenses are determined based on a percentage of total sales. This percentage is reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that the allocation reflects a reasonable rate of corporate expenses based on their use of corporate services.\nCorporate & All Other is comprised of unallocated corporate overhead and certain operations that are not considered separate reportable segments based on their size. This includes the operations of our internal logistics unit responsible for managing and allocating inbound logistics revenue and expense, as well as the operations of certain recent acquisitions.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company reorganized its information technology department, and expenses associated with business application teams are now included in the segment results. The EBITDA for Performance Foodservice, Vistar and Corporate & All Other for the fiscal years ended July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016 have been adjusted to reflect this change.\nThe following tables set forth net sales and EBITDA by segment for the periods indicated (dollars in millions):\nNet Sales\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Results-Performance Foodservice\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017\nNet Sales\nNet sales for Performance Foodservice increased $608.8 million, or 6.2%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. The increase in net sales was attributable to growth in cases sold, as well as an increase in selling price per case as a result of inflation. Case growth in fiscal 2018 was driven by securing new independent customers and further penetrating existing customers. Securing new and expanded business with independent customers resulted in independent sales growth of approximately 8.4% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2018, independent sales as a percentage of total segment sales were 45.2%.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for Performance Foodservice increased $10.6 million, or 3.3%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. This increase was the result of an increase in gross profit, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Gross profit increased by 6.0% in fiscal 2018, compared to the prior fiscal year, as a result of an increase in cases sold, as well as an increase in the gross profit per case. The increase in gross profit per case was driven by a favorable shift in the mix of cases sold toward independent customers and Performance Brands, as well as by an increase in procurement gains. Independent business has higher gross margins than Chain customers within this segment.\nOperating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization for Performance Foodservice increased by $77.1 million, or 6.8%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. Operating expenses increased as a result of an increase in case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses, as well as investments in selling, warehouse, and delivery personnel. Operating expenses also increased as a result of a $10.3 million increase in fuel expense, which mostly occurred in the second half of fiscal 2018.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $57.4 million in fiscal 2017 to $58.7 million in fiscal 2018. This increase was a result of recent acquisitions, computer software, capital leases and warehouse expansion, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets since certain intangibles are now fully amortized.\nFiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales for Performance Foodservice increased $206.1 million, or 2.1%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. This increase in net sales was attributable to growth in cases sold, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. Net sales for the extra week in fiscal 2016 were approximately $188.0 million. Case growth in fiscal 2017 was driven by securing new independent customers and further penetrating existing customers. Securing new and expanded business with independent customers resulted in independent sales growth of approximately 4.6% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2017, independent sales as a percentage of total segment sales were 44.4%.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for Performance Foodservice increased $16.8 million, or 5.5%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. This increase was the result of an increase in gross profit, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization. Gross profit increased by 4.4% in fiscal 2017, compared to the prior fiscal year, as a result of an increase in cases sold, as well as an increase in the gross profit per case, partially offset by gross profit of approximately $28.3 million in the extra week in fiscal 2016. The increase in gross profit per case was driven by a favorable shift in the mix of cases sold toward independent customers and Performance Brands, as well as by an increase in procurement gains. Independent business has higher gross margins than Chain customers within this segment.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for Performance Foodservice increased by $45.3 million, or 4.1%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. Operating expenses increased as a result of an increase in case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses, as well as cost of living and other increases in compensation and benefits and increase in costs associated with insurance expense primarily related to workers' compensation and vehicle liability of $5.9 million. These increases were partially offset by the extra week in fiscal 2016. The Company estimates that operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization were approximately $21.2 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2016.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment decreased from $63.2 million in fiscal 2016 to $57.4 million in fiscal 2017, a decrease of 9.2%. These reductions were a result of a decrease in amortization of intangible assets since certain intangibles are now fully amortized.\nSegment Results-PFG Customized\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017\nNet Sales\nNet sales for PFG Customized decreased $162.3 million, or 4.2%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. The decrease in net sales was primarily a result of the Georgia facility that was closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding the impact of the closed Georgia facility, net sales would have increased $65.0 million in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year as a result of an increase in selling price per case driven by a favorable shift in customer mix.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for PFG Customized increased $4.2 million, or 16.6%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of the closed Georgia facility, an increase in gross profit was offset by an increase in operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization. Gross profit for PFG Customized increased primarily as a result of a favorable shift in customer mix.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased by $9.4 million, or 4.5%, in fiscal 2018, compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the closed Georgia facility, partially offset by increases in personnel expenses and fuel expense.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment decreased from $16.1 million in fiscal 2017 to $14.6 million in fiscal 2018. This decrease is primarily a result of lower amortization expense for certain customer relationship intangible assets, which are now fully amortized.\nFiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales for PFG Customized increased $38.7 million, or 1.0%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales was driven by the new business with Red Lobster in fiscal 2017, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. Net sales for the extra week in fiscal 2016 were approximately $70.2 million.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for PFG Customized decreased $8.8 million, or 25.8%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in gross profit of $5.1 million, or 2.1%, and an increase in operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization. Gross profit for PFG Customized decreased primarily as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 and planned exits of some customers to free up capacity for the addition of the new business with Red Lobster. The Company estimates that gross profit was approximately $4.4 million for the extra week in fiscal 2016. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we began providing distribution solutions to a portion of Red Lobster's restaurants and completed the transition during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased by $3.7 million, or 1.8%, in fiscal 2017, compared to the prior year primarily driven by $5.2 million related to the closing of the Georgia facility, partially offset by $3.8 million of expense in the 53rd week in fiscal 2016.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $15.4 million in fiscal 2016 to $16.1 million in fiscal 2017, an increase of 4.5%. The increase was primarily a result of the accelerated amortization of customer relationship intangible assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 due to volume declines for certain customers.\nSegment Results-Vistar\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017\nNet Sales\nNet sales for Vistar increased $337.4 million, or 11.2%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. This increase was driven by case sales growth in the segment's theater and retail channels, as well as recent acquisitions.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for Vistar increased $15.4 million, or 13.1%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. Gross profit dollar growth of $72.5 million, or 18.4% for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, was driven by an increase in the number of cases sold, as well as an increase in gross profit per case. The increase in gross profit per case was driven by a favorable shift in channel mix, as well as by an increase in procurement gains.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $57.7 million, or 20.9%, for fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year. Operating expenses increased primarily as a result of an increase in case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses, as well as cost of living and other increases in compensation and benefits. Operating expenses also increased as a result of recent acquisitions.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $24.6 million in fiscal 2017 to $27.4 million in fiscal 2018. Amortization of intangible assets increased as a result of recent acquisitions.\nFiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales for Vistar increased $302.1 million, or 11.2%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. This increase was driven by case sales growth in the segment's retail, theater, vending, and hospitality channels and recent acquisitions, partially offset by net sales of approximately $54.1 million in the 53rd week in fiscal 2016.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for Vistar increased $7.6 million, or 6.9%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. This increase in EBITDA was the result of gross profit dollar growth increasing faster than operating expense dollar growth, excluding depreciation and amortization. Gross profit dollar growth of $39.2 million, or 11.0% for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, was driven by an increase in the number of cases sold and recent acquisitions, partially offset by gross profit of approximately $7.0 million in the 53rd week in fiscal 2016.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $30.9 million, or 12.6%, for fiscal 2017. Operating expenses increased primarily as a result of investments associated with expansion of geographies served in the dollar store channel, additional expenses related to recent acquisitions and an increase associated with the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 opening of our automated retail facility, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. The Company estimates that operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization were approximately $4.9 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2016.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $18.2 million in fiscal 2016 to $24.6 million in fiscal 2017, an increase of 35.2%. Amortization of intangible assets increased as a result of acquisitions over the past year. Depreciation of fixed assets increased as a result of capital outlays primarily related to fleet.\nSegment Results-Corporate & All Other\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017\nNet Sales\nNet sales for Corporate & All Other increased $101.6 million from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to recent acquisitions and an increase in logistics services provided to our other segments.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for Corporate & All Other was a negative $109.1 million for fiscal 2018 compared to a negative $124.3 million for fiscal 2017. The improvement in EBITDA was primarily driven by contributions from recent acquisitions and decreases in professional and other services fees of $4.5 million, personnel expenses of $4.4 million, advisory fees of $2.6 million, and insurance of $2.3 million, partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $4.3 million.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $28.0 million in fiscal 2017 to $29.4 million in fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily a result of amortization related to recent acquisitions.\nFiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales for Corporate & All Other increased $127.3 million from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to recent acquisitions and an increase in logistics services provided to our other segments, partially offset by net sales of approximately $4.4 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2016.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for Corporate & All Other was a negative $124.3 million for fiscal 2017 compared to a negative $130.4 million for fiscal 2016. The improvement in EBITDA was primarily driven by recent acquisitions and a $5.5 million decrease in other expenses related to derivative activity, partially offset by an increase in personnel expenses and a $0.8 million increase in professional and legal fees including settlements.\nDepreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $21.8 million in fiscal 2016 to $28.0 million in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily a result of amortization related to recent acquisitions.\nQuarterly Results and Seasonality\nHistorically, the food-away-from-home and foodservice distribution industries are seasonal, with lower profit in the first and third quarters of each calendar year. Consequently, we typically experience lower operating profit during our first and third fiscal quarters, depending on the timing of acquisitions, if any.\nFinancial information for each quarter of

<td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have historically financed our operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, operating and capital leases, and normal trade credit terms. We have typically funded our acquisitions with additional borrowings under our credit facility. Our working capital and borrowing levels are subject to seasonal fluctuations, typically with the lowest borrowing levels in the third and fourth fiscal quarters and the highest borrowing levels occurring in the first and second fiscal quarters. We believe that our cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient both to meet our anticipated cash requirements over at least the next 12 months and to maintain sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes.\nAt June 30, 2018, our cash balance totaled $17.8 million, including restricted cash of $10.3 million, as compared to a cash balance totaling $21.0 million, including restricted cash of $12.9 million, at July 1, 2017. This decrease in cash during fiscal 2018 was attributable to net cash used in investing activities and financing activities of $209.4 million and $160.8 million, respectively, which was partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities of $367.0 million. We borrow under the ABL Facility or pay it down regularly based on our cash flows from operating and investing activities. Our practice is to minimize interest expense while maintaining reasonable liquidity.\nAs market conditions warrant, we may from time to time seek to repurchase our securities or loans in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Any such repurchases may be funded by incurring new debt, including additional borrowings under our ABL Facility. In addition, depending on conditions in the credit and capital markets and other factors, we will, from time to time, consider other financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance our indebtedness, make investments or acquisitions or for other purposes. Any new debt may be secured debt.\nOn October 6, 2015, we completed our initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) of 16,675,000 shares of common stock for an offering price of $19.00 per share ($17.955 per share net of underwriting discounts), including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. We sold an aggregate of 12,777,325 shares of such common stock and certain selling stockholders sold 3,897,675 shares. The aggregate offering price of the amount of newly issued common stock was $242.8 million. In connection with the offering, we paid the underwriters a discount of $1.045 per share, for a total underwriting discount of $13.4 million. In addition, we incurred direct offering expenses consisting of legal, accounting, and printing costs of $5.8 million in connection with the IPO, of which $3.0 million was paid during fiscal 2016. We used the net proceeds to us from the IPO after deducting the underwriting discount and our direct offering expenses to repay $223.0 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under a credit agreement providing for a term loan facility (the Term Facility\u201d). We used the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nOn February 1, 2016, Performance Food Group, Inc. amended and restated the ABL Facility to increase the aggregate principal amount from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, lower interest rates for LIBOR based loans, extend the maturity from May 2017 to February 2021, and modify triggers and provisions related to certain reporting, financial, and negative covenants. The total size of the facility immediately increased the effective borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility since borrowing base assets exceeded the facility size prior to the amendment. Approximately $6.8 million of fees and expenses were incurred for the amendment, which were included as deferred financing costs and will be amortized over the remaining term of the ABL Facility. Of this amount, $6.6 million was paid during fiscal 2016. In connection with the closing of this amendment, Performance Food Group, Inc. borrowed $200.0 million under the ABL Facility and used the proceeds to repay $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of loans under the Term Facility.\nOn May 17, 2016, Performance Food Group, Inc. issued and sold $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.500% Senior Notes due 2024 (the Notes\u201d), pursuant to an indenture dated as of May 17, 2016, that is jointly and severally guaranteed by PFGC, Inc. ( PFGC\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and all domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of PFGC (other than captive insurance subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries). The proceeds from the Notes were used to pay in full the remaining outstanding $306.4 million aggregate principal amount of loans under the Term Facility and to terminate the Term Facility; to temporarily repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility; and to pay the fees, expenses, and other transaction costs incurred in connection with the Notes. Approximately $7.2 million of fees and expenses were incurred and paid during fiscal 2016 in connection with the Notes. Of the amount of fees incurred, $2.5 was included as deferred financing costs and will be amortized over the remaining term of the Notes, $2.1 million was included in loss on extinguishment of debt within interest expense related to the portion of the Term Facility repayment deemed an extinguishment, and $2.6 million was recorded to Operating expenses for the portion of the Term Facility deemed a modification.\nOn August 3, 2017, PFGC, Inc. and Performance Food Group, Inc., each a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into the First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amendment\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and the other lenders party thereto, which amended the ABL Facility. The Amendment amended the ABL Facility by, among other things, (i) increasing the aggregate principal amount under the ABL Facility from $1.6 billion to $1.95 billion by increasing Tranche A Commitments by $325.0 million and the Tranche A-1 Commitments by\n$25.0 million and (ii) maintaining the level of additional commitments permitted, excluding the additional commitments effected pursuant to the Amendment, at $800.0 million under uncommitted incremental facilities.\nOperating Activities\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017\nDuring fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, our operating activities provided cash flow of $367.0 million and $201.7 million, respectively. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was largely driven by higher operating income, improved working capital management and lower taxes paid.\nFiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016\nDuring fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, our operating activities provided cash flow of $201.7 million and $228.5 million, respectively.\nFiscal 2016 cash flows provided by operating activities included a $25.0 million break-up fee payment received related to the terminated agreement to acquire 11 US Foods facilities from Sysco and US Foods. Excluding this fee, cash flows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2016 were $203.5 million. The remaining $1.8 million decrease, excluding the break-up fee payment, in cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was largely driven by an increase in our net working capital investment, partially offset by lower cash income tax payments as a result of timing of the payments and lower cash interest payments as a result of debt pay down associated with the IPO and subsequent refinancings, as well as changes in the timing of payments. Our net working capital, which includes accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and outstanding checks in excess of deposits, fluctuates with our sales growth.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities totaled $209.4 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $332.0 million in fiscal 2017 and $157.6 million in fiscal 2016. These investments consisted primarily of capital purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $140.1 million, $140.2 million and $119.7 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and payments for business acquisitions of $71.1 million, $192.9 million and $39.0 million for fiscal years 2018,"}
