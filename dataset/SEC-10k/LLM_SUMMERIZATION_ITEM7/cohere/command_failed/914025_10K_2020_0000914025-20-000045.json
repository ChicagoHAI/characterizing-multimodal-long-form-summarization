MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand our results of operations and financial condition. It is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for Fiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019 is presented under Results of Operations in this Form 10-K. Discussions regarding our financial condition and results of operations for Fiscal 2019 compared to Fiscal 2018 have been omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K, but can be found in Part II, Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2019, filed with the SEC on May 17, 2019, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at sec.gov and on our website at www.poly.com.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please see the sections entitled \"Certain Forward Looking Information\" and \"Risk Factors\" above for discussions of the uncertainties, risks, and assumptions associated with these statements. Our fiscal year-end financial reporting periods end on the Saturday closest to March 31st. Fiscal Years 2020, 2019, and 2018 each had 52 weeks and ended on March 28, 2020, March 30, 2019, and March 31, 2018 respectively.\nOVERVIEW\nPlantronics, Inc. ( Poly,\u201d Company,\u201d we,\u201d our,\u201d or us\u201d) is a leading global communications company that designs, manufactures, and markets integrated communications and collaboration solutions. Poly combines legendary audio expertise and powerful video and conferencing capabilities to overcome the distractions, complexity and distance that make communication in and out of the workplace challenging. Our major product categories are Headsets, which includes wired and wireless communication headsets; Voice, Video, and Content Sharing Solutions, which includes open Session Initiation Protocol ( SIP\u201d) and native ecosystem desktop phones, conference room phones, and video conferencing solutions and peripherals, including cameras, speakers, and microphones. All of our solutions are designed to integrate seamlessly with the platform and services of our customers choice in a wide range of Unified Communications & Collaboration (\"UC&C\"), Unified Communication as a Service (\"UCaaS\"), and Video as a Service (\"VaaS\") environments. Our cloud management and analytics software enables IT administrators to configure and update firmware, monitor device usage, troubleshoot, and gain deep understanding of user behavior. In addition, we have a broad portfolio of Services including video interoperability, support for our solutions and hardware devices, as well as professional, hosted, and managed services that are grounded in our deep expertise aimed at helping customers achieve their goals for collaboration.\nOn July 2, 2018, we completed our Acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Polycom for approximately $2.2 billion in stock and cash. As a result, on that date we also became a leading global provider of open, standards-based Unified Communications & Collaboration (\"UC&C\") endpoints for voice, video, and content sharing, and a comprehensive line of support and services for the workplace under the Polycom brand.\nOur consolidated financial results for Fiscal Year 2019, includes the financial results of Polycom from July 2, 2018 or three quarters compared to full year financial results in Fiscal Year 2020 and therefore the results discussed below are not directly comparable. For more information regarding the Acquisition, refer to Note 4, Acquisition, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTotal Net Revenues (in millions)\nCompared to the prior year, net revenues increased 1.3% to $1.7 billion. The increase in net revenues was primarily related to the Acquisition, which was partially offset by declines in sales of Headset products. As a result of purchase accounting, a total of $34.0 million of deferred revenue that otherwise would have been recognized in fiscal year 2020 was excluded from annual net revenues of approximately $1.7 billion.\nThe table below summarizes net revenues for the Fiscal Years ended March 28, 2020, and March 30, 2019 by operating segment and product categories:\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 28, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 30, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product Segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Headsets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>773,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>910,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(137,513\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Voice 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>377,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>344,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Video 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>282,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Product Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,432,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,510,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(78,034\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Services Segment2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>264,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,696,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,674,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Voice and Video product net revenues presented net of fair value adjustments to deferred revenue of $1.9 million and $7.9 million for the Fiscal Year ended March 28, 2020, and March 30, 2019, respectively.\n2 Services net revenues presented net of fair value adjustments to deferred revenue of $32.1 million and $76.9 million for the Fiscal Year ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, respectively.\nOperating Loss (in millions)\nOperating loss increased from the prior year to $(804.1) million or (47.4)% of net revenues, driven primarily by a non-cash impairment charge of $179.6 million related to our intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment in the Voice asset group, as well as a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $483.7 million to its Voice and Video reporting units as a result of an overall decline in the Company's earnings and a sustained decrease in its share price. The impairment assessment was further complicated by the impact of COVID-19.\nOur strategic initiatives are primarily focused on driving revenue growth through our end-to-end portfolio of audio and video endpoints, including headsets, desktop phones, conference room phones, and video collaboration solutions. The Acquisition of Polycom has positioned us as a global leader in communications and collaboration endpoints, has allowed us to target the faster-growing market categories, such as Huddle Rooms and work-from-home products, and is allowing us to capture opportunities through data analytics and insight services across a broad range of communications endpoints. Our ability to provide comprehensive solutions to communicate challenges in the marketplace distinguishes us from our competitors and better positions us with our channel partners, customers and strategic alliance partners, which we believe will drive profitable revenue growth.\nWithin the enterprise market, we anticipate the key driver of growth over the next few years will be the continued adoption of UC&C solutions. We believe enterprises are increasing their adoption of UC&C systems to reduce costs, improve collaboration, and migrate to more capable and flexible technology. In addition, with increased demand for tele-services, mobile connections, and remote work styles, we believe that our UC&C portfolio will continue to offer the solutions necessary to fulfill these evolving needs. We expect that the growth of UC&C solutions will increase overall product adoption in enterprise and work-from-anywhere environments.\nIn addition to enabling us to provide comprehensive solutions to drive growth over the long-term, the Acquisition also is allowing us to reevaluate our business, focus resources and efforts on our enterprise strategic initiatives, and to continue to drive operational efficiencies. One of the outcomes of this process led to our announcement in the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2020 that we had started considering strategic alternatives for our Consumer Product portfolio. As a result, in the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2020, this optimization work resulted in charges of $10.4 million related to inventory reserves and supplier liabilities for excess and obsolete inventory. In addition, we recognized $5.4 million of restructuring and other charges related to our Consumer Product portfolio optimization efforts. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2020, we completed the sale of our gaming product portfolio and recognized an immaterial gain in operating expense.\nAdditionally, our consolidation efforts have led to material integration-related cost and expense savings. The majority of these savings are being realized in our operations group where efficiencies in our manufacturing operations and supply chain have helped to reduce our time to market. Simultaneously, we have started to announce and release a number of new and refreshed product offerings in support of our end-to-end strategic initiatives.\nWe remain cautious about the macroeconomic environment, based on uncertainty around trade and fiscal policy in the U.S. and internationally and broader economic uncertainty in many parts of Europe and Asia Pacific, which makes it difficult for us to gauge the economic impacts on our future business. Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we experienced\nsupply chain disruptions, including our ability to manufacture products in our Tijuana, Mexico facility for a short time. We continue to experience difficulty sourcing component parts from our contract manufacturers and we are working with our supply chain and dual source partners to take the necessary steps to mitigate disruption of supply, however there can be no assurance that the ongoing disruptions due to COVID-19 will be resolved in the near term. We furthermore intend to continue monitoring our expenditures, including opportunities to streamline our workforce, tools and processes, and continue to prioritize expenditures that further our strategic long-term growth opportunities, and go to market initiatives under a unified Poly brand.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe group our operations into two reportable segments: Products and Services. Our Products segment consists of Headsets, Voice, and Video product categories and our Services segment consists of support, professional, managed and cloud services and solutions.\nOur consolidated financial results for Fiscal Year 2019 includes the financial results of Polycom from July 2, 2018, or three quarters compared to full year financial results in Fiscal Year 2020. Therefore, the results of operations discussed below are not directly comparable.\nThe following graphs display net revenues by segment for Fiscal Years 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nNet Revenues (in millions)\nRevenue by Segment (percent)\nProducts\nNet revenues decreased in Fiscal Year 2020 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the Headset product category. While we saw record demand for headsets during our fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2020, we experienced annual declines across nearly all product lines including non-UC&C enterprise headsets, gaming headsets, mono Bluetooth headsets, and stereo Bluetooth headsets. The declines were the result of several factors, including product transitions, sales integration and channel consolidation issues, Microsoft Skype to Teams transition, trade and tariff issues in China, and other factors. In addition, the Company made the decision to reduce channel inventories in the third and fourth quarter to optimize inventory levels by reducing sales into our distributors in the following quarters. Additionally, as communicated, the Company determined that it would focus its headset sales on enterprise headsets and would optimize its consumer inventory while selling its gaming headset assets. The decreases were partially offset by increases in our Voice and Video product categories as a result of their being four quarters of revenue in Fiscal Year 2020 compared to three quarters of revenue in Fiscal Year 2019.\nServices\nNet revenues increased in Fiscal Year 2020 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the Acquisition and a decline in deferred revenue excluded due to purchase accounting.\nThe following graphs display net revenues by domestic and international split, as well as by percentage of total net revenue by major geographic region:\nGeographic Information (in millions)\nRevenue by Region (percent)\nAs a percentage of total net revenues, U.S. net revenues increased in Fiscal Year 2020 from Fiscal Year 2019 due primarily to the Service, Voice, and Video product categories introduced as a result of the Acquisition. This increase was partially offset by continued declines in our Headset sales. Our Headset product revenues experienced declines across nearly all product lines, including non-UC&C Enterprise headsets, gaming headsets, stereo Bluetooth headsets, and mono Bluetooth headsets. These declines were partially offset by growth in UC&C Headset product revenues.\nInternational net revenues increased in Fiscal Year 2020 from Fiscal Year 2019 due primarily to the Service and Video product categories introduced as a result of the Acquisition. This increase was mostly offset by continued declines in our Headset sales. Our Headset product revenues experienced declines across nearly all product lines, including non-UC&C Enterprise headsets, mono Bluetooth headsets, gaming headsets, and stereo Bluetooth headsets. Our Voice product category also experienced year-over-year declines. These declines were partially offset by growth in UC&C Headset product revenues.\nFiscal Year 2020 net revenues were also unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates which resulted in a decrease of approximately $14.7 million in net revenues (net of the effects of hedging).\nCost of Revenues and Gross Profit\nCost of revenues consists primarily of direct manufacturing and contract manufacturer costs, warranty costs, freight duties, excess and obsolete inventory costs, royalties, and overhead expenses.\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased in fiscal year 2020, due primarily to impairment charges to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment related to long-lived assets in the voice asset group, fixed cost items spread over lower net revenues, an increase in channel partner incentives, unfavorable currency movements, and inventory-related reserves taken during the third quarter in connection with the optimization of our Consumer product portfolio. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items were material cost reductions as a result of in-sourcing certain products and the non-recurrence of an inventory fair value adjustment in the prior year resulting from the Acquisition.\nThere are significant variances in gross profit percentages between our higher and lower margin products including Polycom products resulting from the Acquisition; therefore, small variations in product mix, which can be difficult to predict, can have a significant impact on gross profit as a percentage of net revenues. Gross profit percentages may also vary based on distribution channel, return rates, and other factors.\nServices\nThe gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to the decrease in deferred revenue fair value adjustment when compared to prior year as a result of the Acquisition.\nResearch, Development, and Engineering\nResearch, development, and engineering costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of compensation costs, outside services, expensed materials, and overhead expenses.\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

in pre-tax losses and benefit from internal intangible property restructuring between our wholly-owned subsidiaries to align the IP structure to our evolving operations resulting in a deferred tax benefit due to the difference in book and tax basis, partially offset by a valuation allowance recorded against U.S. deferred tax assets and stock-based compensation expense recorded following the decision in Altera Corp v. Commissioner by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, discussed below.\nManagement assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the two-year period ended March 28, 2020 and Fiscal Year 2021 forecasted results in the U.S. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation, as of March 28, 2020, a valuation allowance of $72 million was recorded against our U.S. deferred tax assets.\nThe amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income are reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as our future projections.\nOn June 7, 2019, a Ninth Circuit panel reversed the United States Tax Court's holding in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner and upheld the portion of the Treasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring related-party participants in a cost sharing arrangement to share stock-based compensation costs. At this time, the taxpayer is protesting the decision in an en banc rehearing in the US Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit. We have considered the issue and have recorded an $8.6 million discrete tax charge resulting from the cost sharing of prior stock-based compensation, partially offset by a reduction to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act toll charge accrued in prior periods. We will continue to monitor developments related to the case and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur effective tax rate for Fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 differs from the statutory rate due to the impact of foreign operations taxed at different statutory rates, goodwill impairment charge, income tax credits, state taxes, the Tax Act, and other factors. Our future tax rate could be impacted by a shift in the mix of domestic and foreign income, tax treaties with foreign jurisdictions, changes in tax laws in the U.S. or internationally, or a change in estimate of future taxable income, which could result in a valuation allowance being required.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Cash Flow (in millions)\n</td> <td>Investing Cash Flow (in millions)\n</td> <td>Financing Cash Flow (in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe use cash provided by operating activities as our primary source of liquidity. We expect that cash provided by operating activities will fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our revenues, the timing of compensation-related payments, such as our annual bonus/variable compensation plan, interest payments on our long-term debt, product shipments during the quarter, accounts receivable collections, inventory and supply chain management, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments.\nOperating Activities\nCompared to Fiscal Year 2019, net cash provided by operating activities during Fiscal Year 2020 decreased primarily due to lower cash collections, increased cash paid for interest on long-term debt, and an increase in cash paid for restructuring activities. These were partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for integration activities as we completed our integration of the two companies.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities during Fiscal Year 2020 primarily was used for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of real property and our gaming headset product portfolio.\nNet cash used for investing activities during Fiscal Year 2019 increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the Acquisition which closed on July 2, 2018. Refer to Note 4, Acquisition. This decrease was partially offset by the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments.\nWe anticipate our capital expenditures in Fiscal Year 2021 will be approximately $25 million to $35 million, pertaining to costs associated in our manufacturing capabilities, including tooling for new products, new information technology (\"IT\") investments, and facilities upgrades.\nWe will continue to evaluate new business opportunities and new markets; as a result, our future growth within the existing business or new opportunities and markets may dictate the need for additional facilities and capital expenditures to support that growth.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during Fiscal Year 2020 primarily was used for early repayment of long-term debt, dividend payments on our common stock, and taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlements of vested employee equity awards. The uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock from our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\").\nNet cash provided by financing during Fiscal Year 2019 increased from the prior fiscal year as a result of the proceeds received from the term loan facility which were partially offset by repayment of long-term debt, dividend payments, and repurchases of common stock during the fiscal year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity as of March 28, 2020, consisted of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, cash we expect to generate from operations, and a $100 million revolving credit facility. As of March 28, 2020, we had working capital of $209.2 million, including $225.7 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, compared to working capital of $252.9 million, including $215.8 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at March 30, 2019. The decrease in working capital at March 28, 2020 compared to March 30, 2019 resulted primarily from the decline in our cash provided by operations driven by declining revenue and continued integration, restructuring activities, and interest payments on our long-term debt. Additionally, our inventories declined compared to the prior year due in part to the increased demand in the Headset product category and delays in receipts from our suppliers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by working capital increases resulting from a net decrease in accounts payable and lower accrued liabilities related to incentive compensation.\nOur cash and cash equivalents as of March 28, 2020 consist of bank deposits with third party financial institutions. We monitor bank balances in our operating accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate. Cash balances are held throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside of the U.S. As of March 28, 2020, of our $225.7 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, $131.1 million was held domestically while $94.7 million was held by foreign subsidiaries, and approximately 81% was based in USD-denominated instruments. As of March 28, 2020, our remaining investments were composed of Mutual Funds.\nOn July 2, 2018, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement replaced our prior revolving credit facility in its entirety. The Credit Agreement provides for (i) a revolving credit facility with an initial maximum aggregate amount available of $100 million that matures in July 2023 and (ii) a $1.275 billion term loan facility that matures in July 2025. On July 2, 2018, the Company borrowed the full amount available under the term loan facility of $1.245 billion, net of approximately $30 million of discounts and issuance costs. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest due on a monthly basis at a variable rate equal to (i) LIBOR plus a specified margin, or (ii) the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the prime rate publicly announced from time to time by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (c) the sum of 1% plus one-month LIBOR) plus a specified margin. As of March 28, 2020, the Company had five letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility for a total of $1.0 million. In Fiscal Year 2020, we prepaid $25 million of our outstanding principal on the term loan facility. For additional details, refer to Note 10, Debt, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn February 20, 2020, the Company entered into an Amendment No. 2 to Credit Agreement (the Amendment\u201d) by and among the Company, the financial institutions party thereto as lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the Agent\u201d). The Amendment amended the Credit Agreement, as previously amended, to (i) increase the maximum Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) permitted under the Credit Agreement to 3.75 to 1.00 through December 26, 2020 and 3.00 to 1.00 thereafter and (ii) decrease the minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) required under the Credit Agreement to 2.25 to 1.00 through December 26, 2020 and 2.75 to 1.00 thereafter.\nAdditionally, the Amendment modified the calculation of the Secured Net Leverage Ratio and the Interest Coverage Ratio solely for purposes of compliance with Sections 7.11(a) and 7.11(b) of the Credit Agreement to (i) calculate the Secured Net Leverage Ratio net of the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and Cash Equivalents (as defined in the Credit Agreement) on the balance sheet of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Credit Agreement) as of the date of calculation up to an amount equal to $150,000,000 and (ii) solely for purposes of any fiscal quarter ending from December 29, 2019 through December 26, 2020, increase the cap on Expected Cost Savings (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in determining Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to the greater of (A) 20% of Consolidated EBITDA for such Measurement Period (as defined\nin the Credit Agreement) (calculated before giving effect to any such Expected Cost Savings to be added back pursuant to clause (a)(ix) of the definition of Consolidated EBITDA) and (B)(x) for the period from December 29, 2019 through March 28, 2020, $121,000,000, (y) for the period from March 29, 2020 through June 27, 2020, $107,000,000 and (z) for the period from June 28, 2020 through December 26, 2020, $88,000,000.\nThe financial covenants under the Credit Agreement described above are for the benefit of the revolving credit lenders only and do not apply to any other debt of the Company. The Credit Agreement also contains various other restrictions and covenants, some of which become more stringent over time, including restrictions on the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to consolidate or merge, create liens, incur additional indebtedness, dispose of assets, consummate acquisitions, make investments and pay dividends and other distributions.\nAs of March 28, 2020, the Company had five letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility for a total of $1.0 million and had $99 million available under the revolving credit facility. We believe that through the results of our cost reduction actions and debt paydowns, we will be able to continue to meet our financial covenants. However if we are unable to meet our financial covenants, we have the ability to terminate the revolving line of credit such that the financial covenants are no longer applicable. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, the maximum secured net leverage ratio allowed under our covenants is 3.75 to 1.00. The covenant calculation provides for a number of allowable adjustments to EBITDA, including synergy cost savings and integration costs. As of March 28, 2020, our secured net leverage ratio was 2.41 to 1.00, and we were in compliance with the financial covenants. Refer to Note 10, Debt, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn July 30, 2018, we entered into a 4-year amortizing interest rate swap agreement with Bank of America, N.A. The swap has an initial notional amount of $831 million and matures on July 31, 2022. The purpose of this swap is to hedge against changes in cash flows (interest payments) attributable to fluctuations in the contractually specified LIBOR interest rate associated with our credit facility agreement. The swap involves the receipt of floating-rate amounts for fixed interest rate payments over the life of the agreement. We have designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge. The derivative is valued based on prevailing LIBOR rate curves on the date of measurement. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk when we calculate the fair value of the swap. For additional details, refer to Note 16, Derivatives, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs of March 28, 2020, the Company had paid $13.1 million of the toll charge under the Tax Act and the remaining toll charge liability of $65.8 million will be paid over the next six years. The Company also paid a $6.9 million toll charge in October 2018 related to Polycom's pre-acquisition toll charge. For additional details, refer to Note 17, Income Taxes, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFrom time to time, our Board of Directors (\"the Board\") authorizes programs under which we may repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated stock repurchase agreements. On November 28, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a 1.0 million share repurchase program expanding our capacity to repurchase shares to approximately 1.7 million shares. During Fiscal Year 2020, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. As of March 28, 2020, there remained a total of 1,369,014 shares authorized for repurchase under the share repurchase program approved by the Board. Refer to Note 13, Common Stock Repurchases, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our share repurchase programs. We had no retirements of treasury stock in Fiscal Years 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2016, we obtained $488.4 million from debt financing, net of issuance costs. The debt matures\non May 31, 2023 and bears interest at a rate of 5.50% per annum, payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. Refer to Note 10, Debt, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe may at any time and from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. In addition, our liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations in any period could be affected by repurchases of our common stock, the payment of cash dividends, the exercise of outstanding stock options, restricted stock grants under stock plans, and the issuance of common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\"). The Acquisition of Polycom affected our liquidity and leverage ratios and we are reducing our debt leverage ratios by prioritizing the repayment of the debt obtained to finance such Acquisition. We receive cash from the exercise of outstanding stock options under our stock plan and the issuance of shares under our ESPP. However, the resulting increase in the number of outstanding shares from these equity grants and issuances could affect our earnings per share. We cannot predict the timing or amount of proceeds from the sale or exercise of these securities or whether they will be exercised, forfeited, canceled, or will expire.\nOn April 15, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the suspension of the quarterly dividend in order to further preserve financial flexibility. The suspension of the quarterly cash dividend will result in approximately $25 million of annualized cash savings, which we expect to utilize for deleveraging and strengthening the balance sheet.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash provided by operations, and availability of additional funds under the Credit Agreement, as amended from time to time, will be sufficient to fund our operations, however, any projections of future financial needs and sources of working capital are subject to uncertainty, particularly in light of the uncertainty resulting from the impact of COVID-19 on our financial results. Readers are cautioned to review the risks, uncertainties, and assumptions set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections entitled Certain Forward-Looking Information\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d for factors that could affect our estimates for future financial needs and sources of working capital.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nWe have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing and liquidity support, market risk, or credit risk support.\nA substantial portion of the raw materials, components, and subassemblies used in our products are provided by our suppliers on a consignment basis. These consigned inventories are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet until we take title to the raw materials, components, and subassemblies, which occurs when they are consumed in the production process. Prior to consumption in the production process, our suppliers bear the risk of loss and retain title to the consigned inventory. The terms of the agreements allow us to return parts in excess of maximum order quantities to the suppliers at the supplier's expense. Returns for other reasons are negotiated with the suppliers on a case-by-case basis and to date have been immaterial. If our suppliers were to discontinue financing consigned inventory, it would require us to make cash outlays and we could incur expenses which, if material, could negatively affect our business and financial results. As of March 28, 2020, and March 30, 2019, we had off-balance sheet consigned inventories of $21.7 million and $47.1 million, respectively.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nWe use several contract manufacturers to manufacture raw materials, components, and subassemblies for our products. We provide these contract manufacturers with demand information that typically covers periods up to 13 weeks, and they use this information to acquire components and build products. We also obtain individual components for our products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, we acquire components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. As of March 28, 2020, we had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing, component purchase, and other general and administrative commitments of $344.5 million, including off-balance sheet consigned inventories of $21.7 million.\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of March 28, 2020 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>665\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconditional purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, including future interest on the 5.50% Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,744,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>514,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,146,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Toll charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,109,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>538,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,147,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Included in the lease obligations are sublease receipts, which have been netted against the gross lease payments above to arrive at our net minimum lease payments. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options and we may exercise the renewal options.\nOperating Leases\nWe lease certain facilities under operating leases expiring through our Fiscal Year 2027. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options for periods ranging from one to three years and in the normal course of business, we may exercise the renewal options. In addition to the net minimum lease payments noted above, we are contractually obligated to pay certain operating expenses during the term of the lease such as maintenance, taxes and insurance. Included in the lease obligations acquired are Polycom's sublease receipts, which have been netted against the gross lease payments above to arrive at our net minimum lease payments. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options and we may exercise the renewal options.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nWe use several contract manufacturers to manufacture raw materials, components, and subassemblies for our products. We provide these contract manufacturers with demand information that typically covers periods up to 13 weeks, and they use this information to acquire components and build products. We also obtain individual components for our products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, we acquire components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. As of March 28, 2020, we had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing and component purchase commitments of $220.4 million, which we expect to consume in the normal course of business.\nToll Charge\nAs of March 31, 2020, our obligation associated with the deemed repatriation toll charge is $65.8 million, which we are paying over an 8-year period in installments. For additional details regarding the Tax Act and the toll charge, refer to Note 17, Income Taxes, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nAs of March 28, 2020, short-term and long-term income taxes payable reported on our consolidated balance sheet included unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of $36.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of unrecognized tax benefits, as such, they are not included in the contractual obligations table above. On June 7, 2019, a Ninth Circuit panel reversed the United States Tax Court's holding in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, and upheld the portion of the Treasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring related-party participants in a cost sharing arrangement to share stock-based compensation costs. As a result, the Company recorded an $8.6 million discrete tax charge resulting from the cost sharing of prior stock-based compensation. We will continue to monitor developments related to the case and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, future expectations and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On an ongoing basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee.\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Inventory Valuation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Product Warranty Obligations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Income Taxes\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Business Acquisitions\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Goodwill, Purchased Intangibles, and Impairment\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition and Related Allowances\nOur revenue consists of hardware, software, and services. Revenue is recognized when control for these offerings is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products and services.\nOur contracts with customers may include promises to provide multiple deliverables. Determining whether the offerings and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as one combined performance obligation may require significant judgment. Judgment is required to determine the level of integration and interdependency between certain professional services and the related hardware and software. This determination influences whether the services are distinct and accounted for separately as a performance obligation.\nService revenue primarily includes maintenance support on hardware devices and is recognized ratably over the contract term as those services are delivered. Product, software, and certain other services are satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred or as the services are delivered to the customer.\nFor contracts with more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in an amount that depicts the relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") of each obligation. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount that should be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by similar customers and circumstances. In these instances, we use relevant information such as the sales channel and geographic region to determine the SSP.\nOur indirect channel model includes both a two-tiered distribution structure, where we sell to distributors that subsequently sell to resellers, and a one-tiered structure where we sell directly to resellers. For these arrangements, transfer of control begins at the time access to our services is made available to our end customer and entitlements have been contractually established, provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. Judgment is required to determine whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to pay, regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers. If market conditions change significantly, including increased uncertainty of our channel partners liquidity as a result of COVID-19, it could change our assessment, causing a material change in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.\nSales through our distribution and retail channels are made primarily under agreements allowing for rights of return in limited circumstances, such as stock rotation, non-conforming products, and instances where the Company provides its approval. Certain agreements with retail customers may permit rights of return for additional reasons, such as customer satisfaction, in accordance with the terms of the particular contract. Our agreements typically provide for various sales incentive programs, such as back end rebates, discounts, marketing development funds, price protection, and other sales incentives. We have an established sales history for these arrangements and we record the estimated reserves and allowances at the time the related revenue is recognized. Customer sales returns are estimated based on historical data, relevant current data, and the monitoring of inventory in the distribution channel. The partner incentives are intended to drive hardware sell through and reduce revenue in the current period accordingly. Depending on how the payments are made and whether we have right to offset, the reserves associated with the partner incentive programs are recorded on the balance sheet as either contra accounts receivable or accounts payable.\nPurchased Inventory Valuation\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company writes down inventories that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. Our estimate of write downs for excess and obsolete inventory is based on a detailed analysis of on-hand inventory and purchase commitments in excess of forecasted demand. Our products require long-lead time parts available from a limited number of vendors and, occasionally, last-time buys of raw materials for products with long lifecycles. The effects of demand variability, long-lead times, and last-time buys have historically contributed to inventory write-downs. Our demand forecast considers projected future shipments, market conditions, inventory on hand, purchase commitments, product development plans and product life cycle, inventory on consignment, and other competitive factors. Significant and abrupt changes in product demand increases the complexity of management's evaluation of potential excess or obsolete inventory. Refer to \"Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding consigned inventories.\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to estimate our inventory write-downs or adverse purchase commitments during the past three fiscal years. If the demand or market conditions for our products are less favorable than forecasted, including any market shifts or product demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of our inventory, we may be required to record additional inventory write-downs or adverse purchase commitments, which would negatively affect our results of operations in the period the write-downs or adverse purchase commitments were recorded. If we increased our inventory reserve and adverse purchase commitment reserve estimates as of March 28, 2020 by a hypothetical 10%, the reserves and cost of revenues would have each increased by approximately $4.0 million and our net income would have been reduced by approximately $3.0 million.\nProduct Warranty Obligations\nThe Company records a liability for the estimated costs of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. Factors that affect the warranty obligation include historical and projected product failure rates, estimated return rates, material usage, service-related costs incurred in correcting product failure claims, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. If we increased our warranty obligation estimate as of March 28, 2020 by a hypothetical 10%, our obligation and the associated cost of revenues would have each increased by approximately $1.5 million and our net income would have been reduced by approximately $1.1 million.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits may include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one-time, multiple tax years may be subject to audit by various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and fully resolved or clarified.\nTo the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would generally require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.\nWe recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position on income tax expense at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained. An unrecognized tax benefit will not be recognized unless it has a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained. We adjust our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when more information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions.\nThe establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing the intangible assets include, but are not limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, and discount rates. The discount rates used in the income method to discount expected future cash flows to present value are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. For more details about utilization of our deferred tax assets and associated risks, see the discussion under \"Results of Operations\" - \"Income Tax Expense\" as well as the Risk Factor \"We may not be able to utilize our deferred tax assets.\"\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income, and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nAccounting for business acquisitions requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Liabilities assumed may include litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining the related fair values. Independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. Such appraisals are based on significant estimates provided by us, such as forecasted revenues or profits utilized in determining the fair value of contract-related acquired intangible assets or liabilities. Significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as differences in actual and estimated results, could result in material impacts to our financial results. Adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in earnings. Additional information related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities obtained during the allocation period, not to exceed one year, may result in changes to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired.\nGoodwill, Purchased Intangibles, and Impairment\nGoodwill has been measured as the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the amount assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed. At least annually, in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, management performs a review to determine if the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. The identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of fair value at the Company's reporting unit level. The Company determines its reporting units by assessing whether discrete financial information is available and if segment management regularly reviews the results of that component.\nThe Company performs an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of relevant events and circumstances, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and there is no indication of impairment, no further testing is performed; however, if the Company concludes otherwise, a quantitative impairment test must be performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its estimated fair value, goodwill is written down by the excess amount, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The fair value of the Company's reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow model (income approach), which utilizes Level 3 inputs. The income approach includes assumptions for, among others, forecasted revenue, operating income, and discount rates, all of which require significant judgment by management. These assumptions also consider the current industry environment and outlook, and the resulting impact on the Company's expectations for the performance of its business.\nIntangible assets other than goodwill are carried at cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews identifiable finite-lived intangible assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its ultimate disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. The fair value of an asset group is estimated using a discounted cash flow model (income approach), which utilizes Level 3 inputs. The income approach includes assumptions for, among others, forecasted revenue, operating income, and discount rates, all of which require significant judgment by management. For more details about impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets see Note 8: \"Goodwill and Purchased Asset Intangibles\" and the Risk Factor: \"Impairment of our intangible assets and goodwill have resulted in charges that adversely impact our financial results.\"\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand our results of operations and financial condition. It is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for Fiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019 is presented under Results of Operations in this Form 10-K. Discussions regarding our financial condition and results of operations for Fiscal 2019 compared to Fiscal 2018 have been omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K, but can be found in Part II, Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2019, filed with the SEC on May 17, 2019, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at sec.gov and on our website at www.poly.com.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please see the sections entitled \"Certain Forward Looking Information\" and \"Risk Factors\" above for discussions of the uncertainties, risks, and assumptions associated with these statements. Our fiscal year-end financial reporting periods end on the Saturday closest to March 31st. Fiscal Years 2020, 2019, and 2018 each had 52 weeks and ended on March 28, 2020, March 30, 2019, and March 31, 2018 respectively.\nOVERVIEW\nPlantronics, Inc. ( Poly,\u201d Company,\u201d we,\u201d our,\u201d or us\u201d) is a leading global communications company that designs, manufactures, and markets integrated communications and collaboration solutions. Poly combines legendary audio expertise and powerful video and conferencing capabilities to overcome the distractions, complexity and distance that make communication in and out of the workplace challenging. Our major product categories are Headsets, which includes wired and wireless communication headsets; Voice, Video, and Content Sharing Solutions, which includes open Session Initiation Protocol ( SIP\u201d) and native ecosystem desktop phones, conference room phones, and video conferencing solutions and peripherals, including cameras, speakers, and microphones. All of our solutions are designed to integrate seamlessly with the platform and services of our customers choice in a wide range of Unified Communications & Collaboration (\"UC&C\"), Unified Communication as a Service (\"UCaaS\"), and Video as a Service (\"VaaS\") environments. Our cloud management and analytics software enables IT administrators to configure and update firmware, monitor device usage, troubleshoot, and gain deep understanding of user behavior. In addition, we have a broad portfolio of Services including video interoperability, support for our solutions and hardware devices, as well as professional, hosted, and managed services that are grounded in our deep expertise aimed at helping customers achieve their goals for collaboration.\nOn July 2, 2018, we completed our Acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Polycom for approximately $2.2 billion in stock and cash. As a result, on that date we also became a leading global provider of open, standards-based Unified Communications & Collaboration (\"UC&C\") endpoints for voice, video, and content sharing, and a comprehensive line of support and services for the workplace under the Polycom brand.\nOur consolidated financial results for Fiscal Year 2019, includes the financial results of Polycom from July 2, 2018 or three quarters compared to full year financial results in Fiscal Year 2020 and therefore the results discussed below are not directly comparable. For more information regarding the Acquisition, refer to Note 4, Acquisition, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTotal Net Revenues (in millions)\nCompared to the prior year, net revenues increased 1.3% to $1.7 billion. The increase in net revenues was primarily related to the Acquisition, which was partially offset by declines in sales of Headset products. As a result of purchase accounting, a total of $34.0 million of deferred revenue that otherwise would have been recognized in fiscal year 2020 was excluded from annual net revenues of approximately $1.7 billion.\nThe table below summarizes net revenues for the Fiscal Years ended March 28, 2020, and March 30, 2019 by operating segment and product categories:\n\n1 Voice and Video product net revenues presented net of fair value adjustments to deferred revenue of $1.9 million and $7.9 million for the Fiscal Year ended March 28, 2020, and March 30, 2019, respectively.\n2 Services net revenues presented net of fair value adjustments to deferred revenue of $32.1 million and $76.9 million for the Fiscal Year ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, respectively.\nOperating Loss (in millions)\nOperating loss increased from the prior year to $(804.1) million or (47.4)% of net revenues, driven primarily by a non-cash impairment charge of $179.6 million related to our intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment in the Voice asset group, as well as a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $483.7 million to its Voice and Video reporting units as a result of an overall decline in the Company's earnings and a sustained decrease in its share price. The impairment assessment was further complicated by the impact of COVID-19.\nOur strategic initiatives are primarily focused on driving revenue growth through our end-to-end portfolio of audio and video endpoints, including headsets, desktop phones, conference room phones, and video collaboration solutions. The Acquisition of Polycom has positioned us as a global leader in communications and collaboration endpoints, has allowed us to target the faster-growing market categories, such as Huddle Rooms and work-from-home products, and is allowing us to capture opportunities through data analytics and insight services across a broad range of communications endpoints. Our ability to provide comprehensive solutions to communicate challenges in the marketplace distinguishes us from our competitors and better positions us with our channel partners, customers and strategic alliance partners, which we believe will drive profitable revenue growth.\nWithin the enterprise market, we anticipate the key driver of growth over the next few years will be the continued adoption of UC&C solutions. We believe enterprises are increasing their adoption of UC&C systems to reduce costs, improve collaboration, and migrate to more capable and flexible technology. In addition, with increased demand for tele-services, mobile connections, and remote work styles, we believe that our UC&C portfolio will continue to offer the solutions necessary to fulfill these evolving needs. We expect that the growth of UC&C solutions will increase overall product adoption in enterprise and work-from-anywhere environments.\nIn addition to enabling us to provide comprehensive solutions to drive growth over the long-term, the Acquisition also is allowing us to reevaluate our business, focus resources and efforts on our enterprise strategic initiatives, and to continue to drive operational efficiencies. One of the outcomes of this process led to our announcement in the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2020 that we had started considering strategic alternatives for our Consumer Product portfolio. As a result, in the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2020, this optimization work resulted in charges of $10.4 million related to inventory reserves and supplier liabilities for excess and obsolete inventory. In addition, we recognized $5.4 million of restructuring and other charges related to our Consumer Product portfolio optimization efforts. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2020, we completed the sale of our gaming product portfolio and recognized an immaterial gain in operating expense.\nAdditionally, our consolidation efforts have led to material integration-related cost and expense savings. The majority of these savings are being realized in our operations group where efficiencies in our manufacturing operations and supply chain have helped to reduce our time to market. Simultaneously, we have started to announce and release a number of new and refreshed product offerings in support of our end-to-end strategic initiatives.\nWe remain cautious about the macroeconomic environment, based on uncertainty around trade and fiscal policy in the U.S. and internationally and broader economic uncertainty in many parts of Europe and Asia Pacific, which makes it difficult for us to gauge the economic impacts on our future business. Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we experienced\nsupply chain disruptions, including our ability to manufacture products in our Tijuana, Mexico facility for a short time. We continue to experience difficulty sourcing component parts from our contract manufacturers and we are working with our supply chain and dual source partners to take the necessary steps to mitigate disruption of supply, however there can be no assurance that the ongoing disruptions due to COVID-19 will be resolved in the near term. We furthermore intend to continue monitoring our expenditures, including opportunities to streamline our workforce, tools and processes, and continue to prioritize expenditures that further our strategic long-term growth opportunities, and go to market initiatives under a unified Poly brand.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe group our operations into two reportable segments: Products and Services. Our Products segment consists of Headsets, Voice, and Video product categories and our Services segment consists of support, professional, managed and cloud services and solutions.\nOur consolidated financial results for Fiscal Year 2019 includes the financial results of Polycom from July 2, 2018, or three quarters compared to full year financial results in Fiscal Year 2020. Therefore, the results of operations discussed below are not directly comparable.\nThe following graphs display net revenues by segment for Fiscal Years 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nNet Revenues (in millions)\nRevenue by Segment (percent)\nProducts\nNet revenues decreased in Fiscal Year 2020 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the Headset product category. While we saw record demand for headsets during our fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2020, we experienced annual declines across nearly all product lines including non-UC&C enterprise headsets, gaming headsets, mono Bluetooth headsets, and stereo Bluetooth headsets. The declines were the result of several factors, including product transitions, sales integration and channel consolidation issues, Microsoft Skype to Teams transition, trade and tariff issues in China, and other factors. In addition, the Company made the decision to reduce channel inventories in the third and fourth quarter to optimize inventory levels by reducing sales into our distributors in the following quarters. Additionally, as communicated, the Company determined that it would focus its headset sales on enterprise headsets and would optimize its consumer inventory while selling its gaming headset assets. The decreases were partially offset by increases in our Voice and Video product categories as a result of their being four quarters of revenue in Fiscal Year 2020 compared to three quarters of revenue in Fiscal Year 2019.\nServices\nNet revenues increased in Fiscal Year 2020 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the Acquisition and a decline in deferred revenue excluded due to purchase accounting.\nThe following graphs display net revenues by domestic and international split, as well as by percentage of total net revenue by major geographic region:\nGeographic Information (in millions)\nRevenue by Region (percent)\nAs a percentage of total net revenues, U.S. net revenues increased in Fiscal Year 2020 from Fiscal Year 2019 due primarily to the Service, Voice, and Video product categories introduced as a result of the Acquisition. This increase was partially offset by continued declines in our Headset sales. Our Headset product revenues experienced declines across nearly all product lines, including non-UC&C Enterprise headsets, gaming headsets, stereo Bluetooth headsets, and mono Bluetooth headsets. These declines were partially offset by growth in UC&C Headset product revenues.\nInternational net revenues increased in Fiscal Year 2020 from Fiscal Year 2019 due primarily to the Service and Video product categories introduced as a result of the Acquisition. This increase was mostly offset by continued declines in our Headset sales. Our Headset product revenues experienced declines across nearly all product lines, including non-UC&C Enterprise headsets, mono Bluetooth headsets, gaming headsets, and stereo Bluetooth headsets. Our Voice product category also experienced year-over-year declines. These declines were partially offset by growth in UC&C Headset product revenues.\nFiscal Year 2020 net revenues were also unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates which resulted in a decrease of approximately $14.7 million in net revenues (net of the effects of hedging).\nCost of Revenues and Gross Profit\nCost of revenues consists primarily of direct manufacturing and contract manufacturer costs, warranty costs, freight duties, excess and obsolete inventory costs, royalties, and overhead expenses.\n\nProducts\nCompared to the prior fiscal year, gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased in fiscal year 2020, due primarily to impairment charges to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment related to long-lived assets in the voice asset group, fixed cost items spread over lower net revenues, an increase in channel partner incentives, unfavorable currency movements, and inventory-related reserves taken during the third quarter in connection with the optimization of our Consumer product portfolio. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items were material cost reductions as a result of in-sourcing certain products and the non-recurrence of an inventory fair value adjustment in the prior year resulting from the Acquisition.\nThere are significant variances in gross profit percentages between our higher and lower margin products including Polycom products resulting from the Acquisition; therefore, small variations in product mix, which can be difficult to predict, can have a significant impact on gross profit as a percentage of net revenues. Gross profit percentages may also vary based on distribution channel, return rates, and other factors.\nServices\nThe gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to the decrease in deferred revenue fair value adjustment when compared to prior year as a result of the Acquisition.\nResearch, Development, and Engineering\nResearch, development, and engineering costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of compensation costs, outside services, expensed materials, and overhead expenses.\n\nThe increase in research, development, and engineering expenses in Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019 was primarily due to the inclusion of Polycom operating expenses for the fiscal year, partially offset by lower compensation expense driven by reduced variable compensation and cost reductions from our restructuring actions.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nSelling, general, and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation costs, marketing costs, travel expenses, professional service fees, and overhead expenses.\n\nThe increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses in Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019 was primarily due to the inclusion of Polycom operating expenses for the fiscal year, and partially offset by lower compensation expense driven by reduced variable compensation and cost reductions from our restructuring actions.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-lived Assets\n\nThe increase in impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets in Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019 was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge of $483.7 million and long-lived asset impairment charge of $5.4 million as a result of the overall decline in our earnings and a sustained decrease in our share price. Refer to Note 8, Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(Gain) Loss from Litigation Settlements \nDuring Fiscal Year 2020, we recognized immaterial gains from litigation compared to immaterial losses from litigation in Fiscal Year 2019. Refer to Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRestructuring and Other Related Charges\n\nDuring Fiscal Year 2020 restructuring and other related charges increased, due primarily to restructuring actions initiated during the period to streamline our global workforce and achieve planned synergies. For more information regarding restructuring activities, refer to Note 11, Restructuring and Other Related Charges (Credits), of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest Expense\n\nThe increase in interest expense in Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019 was primarily due to interest incurred on our Credit Facility Agreement entered into in connection with the Acquisition. Refer to Note 10, Debt, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Non-Operating Income and (Expense), Net\n\nDuring Fiscal Year 2020 other non-operating income and (expense), net decreased primarily due to lower interest income as our investment portfolios were liquidated during the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2019 to facilitate the Acquisition and sale of equity investments in the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2019.\nIncome Tax Expense\n\nThe effective tax rate for Fiscal Year 2020 was lower than the previous year due to increase in pre-tax losses and benefit from internal intangible property restructuring between our wholly-owned subsidiaries to align the IP structure to our evolving operations resulting in a deferred tax benefit due to the difference in book and tax basis, partially offset by a valuation allowance recorded against U.S. deferred tax assets and stock-based compensation expense recorded following the decision in Altera Corp v. Commissioner by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, discussed below.\nManagement assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the two-year period ended March 28, 2020 and Fiscal Year 2021 forecasted results in the U.S. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation, as of March 28, 2020, a valuation allowance of $72 million was recorded against our U.S. deferred tax assets.\nThe amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income are reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as our future projections.\nOn June 7, 2019, a Ninth Circuit panel reversed the United States Tax Court's holding in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner and upheld the portion of the Treasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring related-party participants in a cost sharing arrangement to share stock-based compensation costs. At this time, the taxpayer is protesting the decision in an en banc rehearing in the US Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit. We have considered the issue and have recorded an $8.6 million discrete tax charge resulting from the cost sharing of prior stock-based compensation, partially offset by a reduction to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act toll charge accrued in prior periods. We will continue to monitor developments related to the case and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur effective tax rate for Fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 differs from the statutory rate due to the impact of foreign operations taxed at different statutory rates, goodwill impairment charge, income tax credits, state taxes, the Tax Act, and other factors. Our future tax rate could be impacted by a shift in the mix of domestic and foreign income, tax treaties with foreign jurisdictions, changes in tax laws in the U.S. or internationally, or a change in estimate of future taxable income, which could result in a valuation allowance being required.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\n\nWe use cash provided by operating activities as our primary source of liquidity. We expect that cash provided by operating activities will fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our revenues, the timing of compensation-related payments, such as our annual bonus/variable compensation plan, interest payments on our long-term debt, product shipments during the quarter, accounts receivable collections, inventory and supply chain management, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments.\nOperating Activities\nCompared to Fiscal Year 2019, net cash provided by operating activities during Fiscal Year 2020 decreased primarily due to lower cash collections, increased cash paid for interest on long-term debt, and an increase in cash paid for restructuring activities. These were partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for integration activities as we completed our integration of the two companies.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities during Fiscal Year 2020 primarily was used for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of real property and our gaming headset product portfolio.\nNet cash used for investing activities during Fiscal Year 2019 increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the Acquisition which closed on July 2, 2018. Refer to Note 4, Acquisition. This decrease was partially offset by the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments.\nWe anticipate our capital expenditures in Fiscal Year 2021 will be approximately $25 million to $35 million, pertaining to costs associated in our manufacturing capabilities, including tooling for new products, new information technology (\"IT\") investments, and facilities upgrades.\nWe will continue to evaluate new business opportunities and new markets; as a result, our future growth within the existing business or new opportunities and markets may dictate the need for additional facilities and capital expenditures to support that growth.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during Fiscal Year 2020 primarily was used for early repayment of long-term debt, dividend payments on our common stock, and taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlements of vested employee equity awards. The uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock from our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\").\nNet cash provided by financing during Fiscal Year 2019 increased from the prior fiscal year as a result of the proceeds received from the term loan facility which were partially offset by repayment of long-term debt, dividend payments, and repurchases of common stock during the fiscal year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity as of March 28, 2020, consisted of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, cash we expect to generate from operations, and a $100 million revolving credit facility. As of March 28, 2020, we had working capital of $209.2 million, including $225.7 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, compared to working capital of $252.9 million, including $215.8 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at March 30, 2019. The decrease in working capital at March 28, 2020 compared to March 30, 2019 resulted primarily from the decline in our cash provided by operations driven by declining revenue and continued integration, restructuring activities, and interest payments on our long-term debt. Additionally, our inventories declined compared to the prior year due in part to the increased demand in the Headset product category and delays in receipts from our suppliers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by working capital increases resulting from a net decrease in accounts payable and lower accrued liabilities related to incentive compensation.\nOur cash and cash equivalents as of March 28, 2020 consist of bank deposits with third party financial institutions. We monitor bank balances in our operating accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate. Cash balances are held throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside of the U.S. As of March 28, 2020, of our $225.7 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, $131.1 million was held domestically while $94.7 million was held by foreign subsidiaries, and approximately 81% was based in USD-denominated instruments. As of March 28, 2020, our remaining investments were composed of Mutual Funds.\nOn July 2, 2018, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement replaced our prior revolving credit facility in its entirety. The Credit Agreement provides for (i) a revolving credit facility with an initial maximum aggregate amount available of $100 million that matures in July 2023 and (ii) a $1.275 billion term loan facility that matures in July 2025. On July 2, 2018, the Company borrowed the full amount available under the term loan facility of $1.245 billion, net of approximately $30 million of discounts and issuance costs. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest due on a monthly basis at a variable rate equal to (i) LIBOR plus a specified margin, or (ii) the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the prime rate publicly announced from time to time by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (c) the sum of 1% plus one-month LIBOR) plus a specified margin. As of March 28, 2020, the Company had five letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility for a total of $1.0 million. In Fiscal Year 2020, we prepaid $25 million of our outstanding principal on the term loan facility. For additional details, refer to Note 10, Debt, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn February 20, 2020, the Company entered into an Amendment No. 2 to Credit Agreement (the Amendment\u201d) by and among the Company, the financial institutions party thereto as lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the Agent\u201d). The Amendment amended the Credit Agreement, as previously amended, to (i) increase the maximum Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) permitted under the Credit Agreement to 3.75 to 1.00 through December 26, 2020 and 3.00 to 1.00 thereafter and (ii) decrease the minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) required under the Credit Agreement to 2.25 to 1.00 through December 26, 2020 and 2.75 to 1.00 thereafter.\nAdditionally, the Amendment modified the calculation of the Secured Net Leverage Ratio and the Interest Coverage Ratio solely for purposes of compliance with Sections 7.11(a) and 7.11(b) of the Credit Agreement to (i) calculate the Secured Net Leverage Ratio net of the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and Cash Equivalents (as defined in the Credit Agreement) on the balance sheet of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Credit Agreement) as of the date of calculation up to an amount equal to $150,000,000 and (ii) solely for purposes of any fiscal quarter ending from December 29, 2019 through December 26, 2020, increase the cap on Expected Cost Savings (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in determining Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to the greater of (A) 20% of Consolidated EBITDA for such Measurement Period (as defined\nin the Credit Agreement) (calculated before giving effect to any such Expected Cost Savings to be added back pursuant to clause (a)(ix) of the definition of Consolidated EBITDA) and (B)(x) for the period from December 29, 2019 through March 28, 2020, $121,000,000, (y) for the period from March 29, 2020 through June 27, 2020, $107,000,000 and (z) for the period from June 28, 2020 through December 26, 2020, $88,000,000.\nThe financial covenants under the Credit Agreement described above are for the benefit of the revolving credit lenders only and do not apply to any other debt of the Company. The Credit Agreement also contains various other restrictions and covenants, some of which become more stringent over time, including restrictions on the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to consolidate or merge, create liens, incur additional indebtedness, dispose of assets, consummate acquisitions, make investments and pay dividends and other distributions.\nAs of March 28, 2020, the Company had five letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility for a total of $1.0 million and had $99 million available under the revolving credit facility. We believe that through the results of our cost reduction actions and debt paydowns, we will be able to continue to meet our financial covenants. However if we are unable to meet our financial covenants, we have the ability to terminate the revolving line of credit such that the financial covenants are no longer applicable. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, the maximum secured net leverage ratio allowed under our covenants is 3.75 to 1.00. The covenant calculation provides for a number of allowable adjustments to EBITDA, including synergy cost savings and integration costs. As of March 28, 2020, our secured net leverage ratio was 2.41 to 1.00, and we were in compliance with the financial covenants. Refer to Note 10, Debt, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn July 30, 2018, we entered into a 4-year amortizing interest rate swap agreement with Bank of America, N.A. The swap has an initial notional amount of $831 million and matures on July 31, 2022. The purpose of this swap is to hedge against changes in cash flows (interest payments) attributable to fluctuations in the contractually specified LIBOR interest rate associated with our credit facility agreement. The swap involves the receipt of floating-rate amounts for fixed interest rate payments over the life of the agreement. We have designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge. The derivative is valued based on prevailing LIBOR rate curves on the date of measurement. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk when we calculate the fair value of the swap. For additional details, refer to Note 16, Derivatives, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs of March 28, 2020, the Company had paid $13.1 million of the toll charge under the Tax Act and the remaining toll charge liability of $65.8 million will be paid over the next six years. The Company also paid a $6.9 million toll charge in October 2018 related to Polycom's pre-acquisition toll charge. For additional details, refer to Note 17, Income Taxes, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFrom time to time, our Board of Directors (\"the Board\") authorizes programs under which we may repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated stock repurchase agreements. On November 28, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a 1.0 million share repurchase program expanding our capacity to repurchase shares to approximately 1.7 million shares. During Fiscal Year 2020, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. As of March 28, 2020, there remained a total of 1,369,014 shares authorized for repurchase under the share repurchase program approved by the Board. Refer to Note 13, Common Stock Repurchases, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our share repurchase programs. We had no retirements of treasury stock in Fiscal Years 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2016, we obtained $488.4 million from debt financing, net of issuance costs. The debt matures\non May 31, 2023 and bears interest at a rate of 5.50% per annum, payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. Refer to Note 10, Debt, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe may at any time and from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. In addition, our liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations in any period could be affected by repurchases of our common stock, the payment of cash dividends, the exercise of outstanding stock options, restricted stock grants under stock plans, and the issuance of common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\"). The Acquisition of Polycom affected our liquidity and leverage ratios and we are reducing our debt leverage ratios by prioritizing the repayment of the debt obtained to finance such Acquisition. We receive cash from the exercise of outstanding stock options under our stock plan and the issuance of shares under our ESPP. However, the resulting increase in the number of outstanding shares from these equity grants and issuances could affect our earnings per share. We cannot predict the timing or amount of proceeds from the sale or exercise of these securities or whether they will be exercised, forfeited, canceled, or will expire.\nOn April 15, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the suspension of the quarterly dividend in order to further preserve financial flexibility. The suspension of the quarterly cash dividend will result in approximately $25 million of annualized cash savings, which we expect to utilize for deleveraging and strengthening the balance sheet.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash provided by operations, and availability of additional funds under the Credit Agreement, as amended from time to time, will be sufficient to fund our operations, however, any projections of future financial needs and sources of working capital are subject to uncertainty, particularly in light of the uncertainty resulting from the impact of COVID-19 on our financial results. Readers are cautioned to review the risks, uncertainties, and assumptions set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections entitled Certain Forward-Looking Information\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d for factors that could affect our estimates for future financial needs and sources of working capital.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nWe have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing and liquidity support, market risk, or credit risk support.\nA substantial portion of the raw materials, components, and subassemblies used in our products are provided by our suppliers on a consignment basis. These consigned inventories are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet until we take title to the raw materials, components, and subassemblies, which occurs when they are consumed in the production process. Prior to consumption in the production process, our suppliers bear the risk of loss and retain title to the consigned inventory. The terms of the agreements allow us to return parts in excess of maximum order quantities to the suppliers at the supplier's expense. Returns for other reasons are negotiated with the suppliers on a case-by-case basis and to date have been immaterial. If our suppliers were to discontinue financing consigned inventory, it would require us to make cash outlays and we could incur expenses which, if material, could negatively affect our business and financial results. As of March 28, 2020, and March 30, 2019, we had off-balance sheet consigned inventories of $21.7 million and $47.1 million, respectively.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nWe use several contract manufacturers to manufacture raw materials, components, and subassemblies for our products. We provide these contract manufacturers with demand information that typically covers periods up to 13 weeks, and they use this information to acquire components and build products. We also obtain individual components for our products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, we acquire components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. As of March 28, 2020, we had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing, component purchase, and other general and administrative commitments of $344.5 million, including off-balance sheet consigned inventories of $21.7 million.\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of March 28, 2020 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\n\n(1) Included in the lease obligations are sublease receipts, which have been netted against the gross lease payments above to arrive at our net minimum lease payments. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options and we may exercise the renewal options.\nOperating Leases\nWe lease certain facilities under operating leases expiring through our Fiscal Year 2027. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options for periods ranging from one to three years and in the normal course of business, we may exercise the renewal options. In addition to the net minimum lease payments noted above, we are contractually obligated to pay certain operating expenses during the term of the lease such as maintenance, taxes and insurance. Included in the lease obligations acquired are Polycom's sublease receipts, which have been netted against the gross lease payments above to arrive at our net minimum lease payments. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options and we may exercise the renewal options.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nWe use several contract manufacturers to manufacture raw materials, components, and subassemblies for our products. We provide these contract manufacturers with demand information that typically covers periods up to 13 weeks, and they use this information to acquire components and build products. We also obtain individual components for our products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, we acquire components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. As of March 28, 2020, we had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing and component purchase commitments of $220.4 million, which we expect to consume in the normal course of business.\nToll Charge\nAs of March 31, 2020, our obligation associated with the deemed repatriation toll charge is $65.8 million, which we are paying over an 8-year period in installments. For additional details regarding the Tax Act and the toll charge, refer to Note 17, Income Taxes, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nAs of March 28, 2020, short-term and long-term income taxes payable reported on our consolidated balance sheet included unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of $36.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of unrecognized tax benefits, as such, they are not included in the contractual obligations table above. On June 7, 2019, a Ninth Circuit panel reversed the United States Tax Court's holding in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, and upheld the portion of the Treasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring related-party participants in a cost sharing arrangement to share stock-based compensation costs. As a result, the Company recorded an $8.6 million discrete tax charge resulting from the cost sharing of prior stock-based compensation. We will continue to monitor developments related to the case and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, future expectations and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On an ongoing basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee.\n \u2022 Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances \n \u2022 Inventory Valuation \n \u2022 Product Warranty Obligations \n \u2022 Income Taxes \n \u2022 Business Acquisitions \n \u2022 Goodwill, Purchased Intangibles, and Impairment \nRevenue Recognition and Related Allowances\nOur revenue consists of hardware, software, and services. Revenue is recognized when control for these offerings is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products and services.\nOur contracts with customers may include promises to provide multiple deliverables. Determining whether the offerings and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as one combined performance obligation may require significant judgment. Judgment is required to determine the level of integration and interdependency between certain professional services and the related hardware and software. This determination influences whether the services are distinct and accounted for separately as a performance obligation.\nService revenue primarily includes maintenance support on hardware devices and is recognized ratably over the contract term as those services are delivered. Product, software, and certain other services are satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred or as the services are delivered to the customer.\nFor contracts with more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in an amount that depicts the relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") of each obligation. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount that should be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by similar customers and circumstances. In these instances, we use relevant information such as the sales channel and geographic region to determine the SSP.\nOur indirect channel model includes both a two-tiered distribution structure, where we sell to distributors that subsequently sell to resellers, and a one-tiered structure where we sell directly to resellers. For these arrangements, transfer of control begins at the time access to our services is made available to our end customer and entitlements have been contractually established, provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. Judgment is required to determine whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to pay, regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers. If market conditions change significantly, including increased uncertainty of our channel partners liquidity as a result of COVID-19, it could change our assessment, causing a material change in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.\nSales through our distribution and retail channels are made primarily under agreements allowing for rights of return in limited circumstances, such as stock rotation, non-conforming products, and instances where the Company provides its approval. Certain agreements with retail customers may permit rights of return for additional reasons, such as customer satisfaction, in accordance with the terms of the particular contract. Our agreements typically provide for various sales incentive programs, such as back end rebates, discounts, marketing development funds, price protection, and other sales incentives. We have an established sales history for these arrangements and we record the estimated reserves and allowances at the time the related revenue is recognized. Customer sales returns are estimated based on historical data, relevant current data, and the monitoring of inventory in the distribution channel. The partner incentives are intended to drive hardware sell through and reduce revenue in the current period accordingly. Depending on how the payments are made and whether we have right to offset, the reserves associated with the partner incentive programs are recorded on the balance sheet as either contra accounts receivable or accounts payable.\nPurchased Inventory Valuation\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company writes down inventories that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. Our estimate of write downs for excess and obsolete inventory is based on a detailed analysis of on-hand inventory and purchase commitments in excess of forecasted demand. Our products require long-lead time parts available from a limited number of vendors and, occasionally, last-time buys of raw materials for products with long lifecycles. The effects of demand variability, long-lead times, and last-time buys have historically contributed to inventory write-downs. Our demand forecast considers projected future shipments, market conditions, inventory on hand, purchase commitments, product development plans and product life cycle, inventory on consignment, and other competitive factors. Significant and abrupt changes in product demand increases the complexity of management's evaluation of potential excess or obsolete inventory. Refer to \"Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding consigned inventories.\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to estimate our inventory write-downs or adverse purchase commitments during the past three fiscal years. If the demand or market conditions for our products are less favorable than forecasted, including any market shifts or product demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of our inventory, we may be required to record additional inventory write-downs or adverse purchase commitments, which would negatively affect our results of operations in the period the write-downs or adverse purchase commitments were recorded. If we increased our inventory reserve and adverse purchase commitment reserve estimates as of March 28, 2020 by a hypothetical 10%, the reserves and cost of revenues would have each increased by approximately $4.0 million and our net income would have been reduced by approximately $3.0 million.\nProduct Warranty Obligations\nThe Company records a liability for the estimated costs of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. Factors that affect the warranty obligation include historical and projected product failure rates, estimated return rates, material usage, service-related costs incurred in correcting product failure claims, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. If we increased our warranty obligation estimate as of March 28, 2020 by a hypothetical 10%, our obligation and the associated cost of revenues would have each increased by approximately $1.5 million and our net income would have been reduced by approximately $1.1 million.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits may include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one-time, multiple tax years may be subject to audit by various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and fully resolved or clarified.\nTo the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would generally require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.\nWe recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position on income tax expense at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained. An unrecognized tax", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand our results of operations and financial condition. It is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for Fiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019 is presented under Results of Operations in this Form 10-K. Discussions regarding our financial condition and results of operations for Fiscal 2019 compared to Fiscal 2018 have been omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K, but can be found in Part II, Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2019, filed with the SEC on May 17, 2019, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at sec.gov and on our website at www.poly.com.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please see the sections entitled \"Certain Forward Looking Information\" and \"Risk Factors\" above for discussions of the uncertainties, risks, and assumptions associated with these statements. Our fiscal year-end financial reporting periods end on the Saturday closest to March 31st. Fiscal Years 2020, 2019, and 2018 each had 52 weeks and ended on March 28, 2020, March 30, 2019, and March 31, 2018 respectively.\nOVERVIEW\nPlantronics, Inc. ( Poly,\u201d Company,\u201d we,\u201d our,\u201d or us\u201d) is a leading global communications company that designs, manufactures, and markets integrated communications and collaboration solutions. Poly combines legendary audio expertise and powerful video and conferencing capabilities to overcome the distractions, complexity and distance that make communication in and out of the workplace challenging. Our major product categories are Headsets, which includes wired and wireless communication headsets; Voice, Video, and Content Sharing Solutions, which includes open Session Initiation Protocol ( SIP\u201d) and native ecosystem desktop phones, conference room phones, and video conferencing solutions and peripherals, including cameras, speakers, and microphones. All of our solutions are designed to integrate seamlessly with the platform and services of our customers choice in a wide range of Unified Communications & Collaboration (\"UC&C\"), Unified Communication as a Service (\"UCaaS\"), and Video as a Service (\"VaaS\") environments. Our cloud management and analytics software enables IT administrators to configure and update firmware, monitor device usage, troubleshoot, and gain deep understanding of user behavior. In addition, we have a broad portfolio of Services including video interoperability, support for our solutions and hardware devices, as well as professional, hosted, and managed services that are grounded in our deep expertise aimed at helping customers achieve their goals for collaboration.\nOn July 2, 2018, we completed our Acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Polycom for approximately $2.2 billion in stock and cash. As a result, on that date we also became a leading global provider of open, standards-based Unified Communications & Collaboration (\"UC&C\") endpoints for voice, video, and content sharing, and a comprehensive line of support and services for the workplace under the Polycom brand.\nOur consolidated financial results for Fiscal Year 2019, includes the financial results of Polycom from July 2, 2018 or three quarters compared to full year financial results in Fiscal Year 2020 and therefore the results discussed below are not directly comparable. For more information regarding the Acquisition, refer to Note 4, Acquisition, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTotal Net Revenues (in millions)\nCompared to the prior year, net revenues increased 1.3% to $1.7 billion. The increase in net revenues was primarily related to the Acquisition, which was partially offset by declines in sales of Headset products. As a result of purchase accounting, a total of $34.0 million of deferred revenue that otherwise would have been recognized in fiscal year 2020 was excluded from annual net revenues of approximately $1.7 billion.\nThe table below summarizes net revenues for the Fiscal Years ended March 28, 2020, and March 30, 2019 by operating segment and product categories:\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 28, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 30, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product Segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Headsets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>773,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>910,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(137,513\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Voice 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>377,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>344,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Video 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>282,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Product Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,432,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,510,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(78,034\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Services Segment2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>264,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,696,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,674,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Voice and Video product net revenues presented net of fair value adjustments to deferred revenue of $1.9 million and $7.9 million for the Fiscal Year ended March 28, 2020, and March 30, 2019, respectively.\n2 Services net revenues presented net of fair value adjustments to deferred revenue of $32.1 million and $76.9 million for the Fiscal Year ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, respectively.\nOperating Loss (in millions)\nOperating loss increased from the prior year to $(804.1) million or (47.4)% of net revenues, driven primarily by a non-cash impairment charge of $179.6 million related to our intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment in the Voice asset group, as well as a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $483.7 million to its Voice and Video reporting units as a result of an overall decline in the Company's earnings and a sustained decrease in its share price. The impairment assessment was further complicated by the impact of COVID-19.\nOur strategic initiatives are primarily focused on driving revenue growth through our end-to-end portfolio of audio and video endpoints, including headsets, desktop phones, conference room phones, and video collaboration solutions. The Acquisition of Polycom has positioned us as a global leader in communications and collaboration endpoints, has allowed us to target the faster-growing market categories, such as Huddle Rooms and work-from-home products, and is allowing us to capture opportunities through data analytics and insight services across a broad range of communications endpoints. Our ability to provide comprehensive solutions to communicate challenges in the marketplace distinguishes us from our competitors and better positions us with our channel partners, customers and strategic alliance partners, which we believe will drive profitable revenue growth.\nWithin the enterprise market, we anticipate the key driver of growth over the next few years will be the continued adoption of UC&C solutions. We believe enterprises are increasing their adoption of UC&C systems to reduce costs, improve collaboration, and migrate to more capable and flexible technology. In addition, with increased demand for tele-services, mobile connections, and remote work styles, we believe that our UC&C portfolio will continue to offer the solutions necessary to fulfill these evolving needs. We expect that the growth of UC&C solutions will increase overall product adoption in enterprise and work-from-anywhere environments.\nIn addition to enabling us to provide comprehensive solutions to drive growth over the long-term, the Acquisition also is allowing us to reevaluate our business, focus resources and efforts on our enterprise strategic initiatives, and to continue to drive operational efficiencies. One of the outcomes of this process led to our announcement in the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2020 that we had started considering strategic alternatives for our Consumer Product portfolio. As a result, in the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2020, this optimization work resulted in charges of $10.4 million related to inventory reserves and supplier liabilities for excess and obsolete inventory. In addition, we recognized $5.4 million of restructuring and other charges related to our Consumer Product portfolio optimization efforts. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2020, we completed the sale of our gaming product portfolio and recognized an immaterial gain in operating expense.\nAdditionally, our consolidation efforts have led to material integration-related cost and expense savings. The majority of these savings are being realized in our operations group where efficiencies in our manufacturing operations and supply chain have helped to reduce our time to market. Simultaneously, we have started to announce and release a number of new and refreshed product offerings in support of our end-to-end strategic initiatives.\nWe remain cautious about the macroeconomic environment, based on uncertainty around trade and fiscal policy in the U.S. and internationally and broader economic uncertainty in many parts of Europe and Asia Pacific, which makes it difficult for us to gauge the economic impacts on our future business. Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we experienced\nsupply chain disruptions, including our ability to manufacture products in our Tijuana, Mexico facility for a short time. We continue to experience difficulty sourcing component parts from our contract manufacturers and we are working with our supply chain and dual source partners to take the necessary steps to mitigate disruption of supply, however there can be no assurance that the ongoing disruptions due to COVID-19 will be resolved in the near term. We furthermore intend to continue monitoring our expenditures, including opportunities to streamline our workforce, tools and processes, and continue to prioritize expenditures that further our strategic long-term growth opportunities, and go to market initiatives under a unified Poly brand.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe group our operations into two reportable segments: Products and Services. Our Products segment consists of Headsets, Voice, and Video product categories and our Services segment consists of support, professional, managed and cloud services and solutions.\nOur consolidated financial results for Fiscal Year 2019 includes the financial results of Polycom from July 2, 2018, or three quarters compared to full year financial results in Fiscal Year 2020. Therefore, the results of operations discussed below are not directly comparable.\nThe following graphs display net revenues by segment for Fiscal Years 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nNet Revenues (in millions)\nRevenue by Segment (percent)\nProducts\nNet revenues decreased in Fiscal Year 2020 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the Headset product category. While we saw record demand for headsets during our fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2020, we experienced annual declines across nearly all product lines including non-UC&C enterprise headsets, gaming headsets, mono Bluetooth headsets, and stereo Bluetooth headsets. The declines were the result of several factors, including product transitions, sales integration and channel consolidation issues, Microsoft Skype to Teams transition, trade and tariff issues in China, and other factors. In addition, the Company made the decision to reduce channel inventories in the third and fourth quarter to optimize inventory levels by reducing sales into our distributors in the following quarters. Additionally, as communicated, the Company determined that it would focus its headset sales on enterprise headsets and would optimize its consumer inventory while selling its gaming headset assets. The decreases were partially offset by increases in our Voice and Video product categories as a result of their being four quarters of revenue in Fiscal Year 2020 compared to three quarters of revenue in Fiscal Year 2019.\nServices\nNet revenues increased in Fiscal Year 2020 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the Acquisition and a decline in deferred revenue excluded due to purchase accounting.\nThe following graphs display net revenues by domestic and international split, as well as by percentage of total net revenue by major geographic region:\nGeographic Information (in millions)\nRevenue by Region (percent)\nAs a percentage of total net revenues, U.S. net revenues increased in Fiscal Year 2020 from Fiscal Year 2019 due primarily to the Service, Voice, and Video product categories introduced as a result of the Acquisition. This increase was partially offset by continued declines in our Headset sales. Our Headset product revenues experienced declines across nearly all product lines, including non-UC&C Enterprise headsets, gaming headsets, stereo Bluetooth headsets, and mono Bluetooth headsets. These declines were partially offset by growth in UC&C Headset product revenues.\nInternational net revenues increased in Fiscal Year 2020 from Fiscal Year 2019 due primarily to the Service and Video product categories introduced as a result of the Acquisition. This increase was mostly offset by continued declines in our Headset sales. Our Headset product revenues experienced declines across nearly all product lines, including non-UC&C Enterprise headsets, mono Bluetooth headsets, gaming headsets, and stereo Bluetooth headsets. Our Voice product category also experienced year-over-year declines. These declines were partially offset by growth in UC&C Headset product revenues.\nFiscal Year 2020 net revenues were also unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates which resulted in a decrease of approximately $14.7 million in net revenues (net of the effects of hedging).\nCost of Revenues and Gross Profit\nCost of revenues consists primarily of direct manufacturing and contract manufacturer costs, warranty costs, freight duties, excess and obsolete inventory costs, royalties, and overhead expenses.\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased in fiscal year 2020, due primarily to impairment charges to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment related to long-lived assets in the voice asset group, fixed cost items spread over lower net revenues, an increase in channel partner incentives, unfavorable currency movements, and inventory-related reserves taken during the third quarter in connection with the optimization of our Consumer product portfolio. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items were material cost reductions as a result of in-sourcing certain products and the non-recurrence of an inventory fair value adjustment in the prior year resulting from the Acquisition.\nThere are significant variances in gross profit percentages between our higher and lower margin products including Polycom products resulting from the Acquisition; therefore, small variations in product mix, which can be difficult to predict, can have a significant impact on gross profit as a percentage of net revenues. Gross profit percentages may also vary based on distribution channel, return rates, and other factors.\nServices\nThe gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to the decrease in deferred revenue fair value adjustment when compared to prior year as a result of the Acquisition.\nResearch, Development, and Engineering\nResearch, development, and engineering costs are

in pre-tax losses and benefit from internal intangible property restructuring between our wholly-owned subsidiaries to align the IP structure to our evolving operations resulting in a deferred tax benefit due to the difference in book and tax basis, partially offset by a valuation allowance recorded against U.S. deferred tax assets and stock-based compensation expense recorded following the decision in Altera Corp v. Commissioner by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, discussed below.\nManagement assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the two-year period ended March 28, 2020 and Fiscal Year 2021 forecasted results in the U.S. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation, as of March 28, 2020, a valuation allowance of $72 million was recorded against our U.S. deferred tax assets.\nThe amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income are reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as our future projections.\nOn June 7, 2019, a Ninth Circuit panel reversed the United States Tax Court's holding in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner and upheld the portion of the Treasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring related-party participants in a cost sharing arrangement to share stock-based compensation costs. At this time, the taxpayer is protesting the decision in an en banc rehearing in the US Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit. We have considered the issue and have recorded an $8.6 million discrete tax charge resulting from the cost sharing of prior stock-based compensation, partially offset by a reduction to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act toll charge accrued in prior periods. We will continue to monitor developments related to the case and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur effective tax rate for Fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 differs from the statutory rate due to the impact of foreign operations taxed at different statutory rates, goodwill impairment charge, income tax credits, state taxes, the Tax Act, and other factors. Our future tax rate could be impacted by a shift in the mix of domestic and foreign income, tax treaties with foreign jurisdictions, changes in tax laws in the U.S. or internationally, or a change in estimate of future taxable income, which could result in a valuation allowance being required.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Cash Flow (in millions)\n</td> <td>Investing Cash Flow (in millions)\n</td> <td>Financing Cash Flow (in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe use cash provided by operating activities as our primary source of liquidity. We expect that cash provided by operating activities will fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our revenues, the timing of compensation-related payments, such as our annual bonus/variable compensation plan, interest payments on our long-term debt, product shipments during the quarter, accounts receivable collections, inventory and supply chain management, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments.\nOperating Activities\nCompared to Fiscal Year 2019, net cash provided by operating activities during Fiscal Year 2020 decreased primarily due to lower cash collections, increased cash paid for interest on long-term debt, and an increase in cash paid for restructuring activities. These were partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for integration activities as we completed our integration of the two companies.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities during Fiscal Year 2020 primarily was used for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of real property and our gaming headset product portfolio.\nNet cash used for investing activities during Fiscal Year 2019 increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the Acquisition which closed on July 2, 2018. Refer to Note 4, Acquisition. This decrease was partially offset by the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments.\nWe anticipate our capital expenditures in Fiscal Year 2021 will be approximately $25 million to $35 million, pertaining to costs associated in our manufacturing capabilities, including tooling for new products, new information technology (\"IT\") investments, and facilities upgrades.\nWe will continue to evaluate new business opportunities and new markets; as a result, our future growth within the existing business or new opportunities and markets may dictate the need for additional facilities and capital expenditures to support that growth.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during Fiscal Year 2020 primarily was used for early repayment of long-term debt, dividend payments on our common stock, and taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlements of vested employee equity awards. The uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock from our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\").\nNet cash provided by financing during Fiscal Year 2019 increased from the prior fiscal year as a result of the proceeds received from the term loan facility which were partially offset by repayment of long-term debt, dividend payments, and repurchases of common stock during the fiscal year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity as of March 28, 2020, consisted of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, cash we expect to generate from operations, and a $100 million revolving credit facility. As of March 28, 2020, we had working capital of $209.2 million, including $225.7 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, compared to working capital of $252.9 million, including $215.8 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at March 30, 2019. The decrease in working capital at March 28, 2020 compared to March 30, 2019 resulted primarily from the decline in our cash provided by operations driven by declining revenue and continued integration, restructuring activities, and interest payments on our long-term debt. Additionally, our inventories declined compared to the prior year due in part to the increased demand in the Headset product category and delays in receipts from our suppliers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by working capital increases resulting from a net decrease in accounts payable and lower accrued liabilities related to incentive compensation.\nOur cash and cash equivalents as of March 28, 2020 consist of bank deposits with third party financial institutions. We monitor bank balances in our operating accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate. Cash balances are held throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside of the U.S. As of March 28, 2020, of our $225.7 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, $131.1 million was held domestically while $94.7 million was held by foreign subsidiaries, and approximately 81% was based in USD-denominated instruments. As of March 28, 2020, our remaining investments were composed of Mutual Funds.\nOn July 2, 2018, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement replaced our prior revolving credit facility in its entirety. The Credit Agreement provides for (i) a revolving credit facility with an initial maximum aggregate amount available of $100 million that matures in July 2023 and (ii) a $1.275 billion term loan facility that matures in July 2025. On July 2, 2018, the Company borrowed the full amount available under the term loan facility of $1.245 billion, net of approximately $30 million of discounts and issuance costs. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest due on a monthly basis at a variable rate equal to (i) LIBOR plus a specified margin, or (ii) the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the prime rate publicly announced from time to time by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (c) the sum of 1% plus one-month LIBOR) plus a specified margin. As of March 28, 2020, the Company had five letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility for a total of $1.0 million. In Fiscal Year 2020, we prepaid $25 million of our outstanding principal on the term loan facility. For additional details, refer to Note 10, Debt, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn February 20, 2020, the Company entered into an Amendment No. 2 to Credit Agreement (the Amendment\u201d) by and among the Company, the financial institutions party thereto as lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the Agent\u201d). The Amendment amended the Credit Agreement, as previously amended, to (i) increase the maximum Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) permitted under the Credit Agreement to 3.75 to 1.00 through December 26, 2020 and 3.00 to 1.00 thereafter and (ii) decrease the minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) required under the Credit Agreement to 2.25 to 1.00 through December 26, 2020 and 2.75 to 1.00 thereafter.\nAdditionally, the Amendment modified the calculation of the Secured Net Leverage Ratio and the Interest Coverage Ratio solely for purposes of compliance with Sections 7.11(a) and 7.11(b) of the Credit Agreement to (i) calculate the Secured Net Leverage Ratio net of the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and Cash Equivalents (as defined in the Credit Agreement) on the balance sheet of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Credit Agreement) as of the date of calculation up to an amount equal to $150,000,000 and (ii) solely for purposes of any fiscal quarter ending from December 29, 2019 through December 26, 2020, increase the cap on Expected Cost Savings (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in determining Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to the greater of (A) 20% of Consolidated EBITDA for such Measurement Period (as defined\nin the Credit Agreement) (calculated before giving effect to any such Expected Cost Savings to be added back pursuant to clause (a)(ix) of the definition of Consolidated EBITDA) and (B)(x) for the period from December 29, 2019 through March 28, 2020, $121,000,000, (y) for the period from March 29, 2020 through June 27, 2020, $107,000,000 and (z) for the period from June 28, 2020 through December 26, 2020, $88,000,000.\nThe financial covenants under the Credit Agreement described above are for the benefit of the revolving credit lenders only and do not apply to any other debt of the Company. The Credit Agreement also contains various other restrictions and covenants, some of which become more stringent over time, including restrictions on the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to consolidate or merge, create liens, incur additional indebtedness, dispose of assets, consummate acquisitions, make investments and pay dividends and other distributions.\nAs of March 28, 2020, the Company had five letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility for a total of $1.0 million and had $99 million available under the revolving credit facility. We believe that through the results of our cost reduction actions and debt paydowns, we will be able to continue to meet our financial covenants. However if we are unable to meet our financial covenants, we have the ability to terminate the revolving line of credit such that the financial covenants are no longer applicable. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, the maximum secured net leverage ratio allowed under our covenants is 3.75 to 1.00. The covenant calculation provides for a number of allowable adjustments to EBITDA, including synergy cost savings and integration costs. As of March 28, 2020, our secured net leverage ratio was 2.41 to 1.00, and we were in compliance with the financial covenants. Refer to Note 10, Debt, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn July 30, 2018, we entered into a 4-year amortizing interest rate swap agreement with Bank of America, N.A. The swap has an initial notional amount of $831 million and matures on July 31, 2022. The purpose of this swap is to hedge against changes in cash flows (interest payments) attributable to fluctuations in the contractually specified LIBOR interest rate associated with our credit facility agreement. The swap involves the receipt of floating-rate amounts for fixed interest rate payments over the life of the agreement. We have designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge. The derivative is valued based on prevailing LIBOR rate curves on the date of measurement. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk when we calculate the fair value of the swap. For additional details, refer to Note 16, Derivatives, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs of March 28, 2020, the Company had paid $13.1 million of the toll charge under the Tax Act and the remaining toll charge liability of $65.8 million will be paid over the next six years. The Company also paid a $6.9 million toll charge in October 2018 related to Polycom's pre-acquisition toll charge. For additional details, refer to Note 17, Income Taxes, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFrom time to time, our Board of Directors (\"the Board\") authorizes programs under which we may repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated stock repurchase agreements. On November 28, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a 1.0 million share repurchase program expanding our capacity to repurchase shares to approximately 1.7 million shares. During Fiscal Year 2020, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. As of March 28, 2020, there remained a total of 1,369,014 shares authorized for repurchase under the share repurchase program approved by the Board. Refer to Note 13, Common Stock Repurchases, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our share repurchase programs. We had no retirements of treasury stock in Fiscal Years 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2016, we obtained $488.4 million from debt financing, net of issuance costs. The debt matures\non May 31, 2023 and bears interest at a rate of 5.50% per annum, payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. Refer to Note 10, Debt, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe may at any time and from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. In addition, our liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations in any period could be affected by repurchases of our common stock, the payment of cash dividends, the exercise of outstanding stock options, restricted stock grants under stock plans, and the issuance of common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\"). The Acquisition of Polycom affected our liquidity and leverage ratios and we are reducing our debt leverage ratios by prioritizing the repayment of the debt obtained to finance such Acquisition. We receive cash from the exercise of outstanding stock options under our stock plan and the issuance of shares under our ESPP. However, the resulting increase in the number of outstanding shares from these equity grants and issuances could affect our earnings per share. We cannot predict the timing or amount of proceeds from the sale or exercise of these securities or whether they will be exercised, forfeited, canceled, or will expire.\nOn April 15, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the suspension of the quarterly dividend in order to further preserve financial flexibility. The suspension of the quarterly cash dividend will result in approximately $25 million of annualized cash savings, which we expect to utilize for deleveraging and strengthening the balance sheet.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash provided by operations, and availability of additional funds under the Credit Agreement, as amended from time to time, will be sufficient to fund our operations, however, any projections of future financial needs and sources of working capital are subject to uncertainty, particularly in light of the uncertainty resulting from the impact of COVID-19 on our financial results. Readers are cautioned to review the risks, uncertainties, and assumptions set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections entitled Certain Forward-Looking Information\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d for factors that could affect our estimates for future financial needs and sources of working capital.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nWe have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing and liquidity support, market risk, or credit risk support.\nA substantial portion of the raw materials, components, and subassemblies used in our products are provided by our suppliers on a consignment basis. These consigned inventories are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet until we take title to the raw materials, components, and subassemblies, which occurs when they are consumed in the production process. Prior to consumption in the production process, our suppliers bear the risk of loss and retain title to the consigned inventory. The terms of the agreements allow us to return parts in excess of maximum order quantities to the suppliers at the supplier's expense. Returns for other reasons are negotiated with the suppliers on a case-by-case basis and to date have been immaterial. If our suppliers were to discontinue financing consigned inventory, it would require us to make cash outlays and we could incur expenses which, if material, could negatively affect our business and financial results. As of March 28, 2020, and March 30, 2019, we had off-balance sheet consigned inventories of $21.7 million and $47.1 million, respectively.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nWe use several contract manufacturers to manufacture raw materials, components, and subassemblies for our products. We provide these contract manufacturers with demand information that typically covers periods up to 13 weeks, and they use this information to acquire components and build products. We also obtain individual components for our products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, we acquire components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. As of March 28, 2020, we had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing, component purchase, and other general and administrative commitments of $344.5 million, including off-balance sheet consigned inventories of $21.7 million.\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of March 28, 2020 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>665\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconditional purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, including future interest on the 5.50% Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,744,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>514,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,146,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Toll charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,109,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>538,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,147,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Included in the lease obligations are sublease receipts, which have been netted against the gross lease payments above to arrive at our net minimum lease payments. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options and we may exercise the renewal options.\nOperating Leases\nWe lease certain facilities under operating leases expiring through our Fiscal Year 2027. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options for periods ranging from one to three years and in the normal course of business, we may exercise the renewal options. In addition to the net minimum lease payments noted above, we are contractually obligated to pay certain operating expenses during the term of the lease such as maintenance, taxes and insurance. Included in the lease obligations acquired are Polycom's sublease receipts, which have been netted against the gross lease payments above to arrive at our net minimum lease payments. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options and we may exercise the renewal options.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nWe use several contract manufacturers to manufacture raw materials, components, and subassemblies for our products. We provide these contract manufacturers with demand information that typically covers periods up to 13 weeks, and they use this information to acquire components and build products. We also obtain individual components for our products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, we acquire components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. As of March 28, 2020, we had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing and component purchase commitments of $220.4 million, which we expect to consume in the normal course of business.\nToll Charge\nAs of March 31, 2020, our obligation associated with the deemed repatriation toll charge is $65.8 million, which we are paying over an 8-year period in installments. For additional details regarding the Tax Act and the toll charge, refer to Note 17, Income Taxes, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nAs of March 28, 2020, short-term and long-term income taxes payable reported on our consolidated balance sheet included unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of $36.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of unrecognized tax benefits, as such, they are not included in the contractual obligations table above. On June 7, 2019, a Ninth Circuit panel reversed the United States Tax Court's holding in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, and upheld the portion of the Treasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring related-party participants in a cost sharing arrangement to share stock-based compensation costs. As a result, the Company recorded an $8.6 million discrete tax charge resulting from the cost sharing of prior stock-based compensation. We will continue to monitor developments related to the case and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, future expectations and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On an ongoing basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee.\n \u2022 Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances \n \u2022 Inventory Valuation \n \u2022 Product Warranty Obligations \n \u2022 Income Taxes \n \u2022 Business Acquisitions \n \u2022 Goodwill, Purchased Intangibles, and Impairment \nRevenue Recognition and Related Allowances\nOur revenue consists of hardware, software, and services. Revenue is recognized when control for these offerings is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products and services.\nOur contracts with customers may include promises to provide multiple deliverables. Determining whether the offerings and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as one combined performance obligation may require significant judgment. Judgment is required to determine the level of integration and interdependency between certain professional services and the related hardware and software. This determination influences whether the services are distinct and accounted for separately as a performance obligation.\nService revenue primarily includes maintenance support on hardware devices and is recognized ratably over the contract term as those services are delivered. Product, software, and certain other services are satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred or as the services are delivered to the customer.\nFor contracts with more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in an amount that depicts the relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") of each obligation. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount that should be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by similar customers and circumstances. In these instances, we use relevant information such as the sales channel and geographic region to determine the SSP.\nOur indirect channel model includes both a two-tiered distribution structure, where we sell to distributors that subsequently sell to resellers, and a one-tiered structure where we sell directly to resellers. For these arrangements, transfer of control begins at the time access to our services is made available to our end customer and entitlements have been contractually established, provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. Judgment is required to determine whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to pay, regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers. If market conditions change significantly, including increased uncertainty of our channel partners liquidity as a result of COVID-19, it could change our assessment, causing a material change in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.\nSales through our distribution and retail channels are made primarily under agreements allowing for rights of return in limited circumstances, such as stock rotation, non-conforming products, and instances where the Company provides its approval. Certain agreements with retail customers may permit rights of return for additional reasons, such as customer satisfaction, in accordance with the terms of the particular contract. Our agreements typically provide for various sales incentive programs, such as back end rebates, discounts, marketing development funds, price protection, and other sales incentives. We have an established sales history for these arrangements and we record the estimated reserves and allowances at the time the related revenue is recognized. Customer sales returns are estimated based on historical data, relevant current data, and the monitoring of inventory in the distribution channel. The partner incentives are intended to drive hardware sell through and reduce revenue in the current period accordingly. Depending on how the payments are made and whether we have right to offset, the reserves associated with the partner incentive programs are recorded on the balance sheet as either contra accounts receivable or accounts payable.\nPurchased Inventory Valuation\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company writes down inventories that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. Our estimate of write downs for excess and obsolete inventory is based on a detailed analysis of on-hand inventory and purchase commitments in excess of forecasted demand. Our products require long-lead time parts available from a limited number of vendors and, occasionally, last-time buys of raw materials for products with long lifecycles. The effects of demand variability, long-lead times, and last-time buys have historically contributed to inventory write-downs. Our demand forecast considers projected future shipments, market conditions, inventory on hand, purchase commitments, product development plans and product life cycle, inventory on consignment, and other competitive factors. Significant and abrupt changes in product demand increases the complexity of management's evaluation of potential excess or obsolete inventory. Refer to \"Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding consigned inventories.\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to estimate our inventory write-downs or adverse purchase commitments during the past three fiscal years. If the demand or market conditions for our products are less favorable than forecasted, including any market shifts or product demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of our inventory, we may be required to record additional inventory write-downs or adverse purchase commitments, which would negatively affect our results of operations in the period the write-downs or adverse purchase commitments were recorded. If we increased our inventory reserve and adverse purchase commitment reserve estimates as of March 28, 2020 by a hypothetical 10%, the reserves and cost of revenues would have each increased by approximately $4.0 million and our net income would have been reduced by approximately $3.0 million.\nProduct Warranty Obligations\nThe Company records a liability for the estimated costs of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. Factors that affect the warranty obligation include historical and projected product failure rates, estimated return rates, material usage, service-related costs incurred in correcting product failure claims, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. If we increased our warranty obligation estimate as of March 28, 2020 by a hypothetical 10%, our obligation and the associated cost of revenues would have each increased by approximately $1.5 million and our net income would have been reduced by approximately $1.1 million.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits may include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one-time, multiple tax years may be subject to audit by various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and fully resolved or clarified.\nTo the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would generally require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.\nWe recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position on income tax expense at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained.
