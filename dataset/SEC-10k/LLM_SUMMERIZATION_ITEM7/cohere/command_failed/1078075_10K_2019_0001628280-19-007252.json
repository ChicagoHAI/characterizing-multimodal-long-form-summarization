Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial information and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Actual events or results may differ materially due to competitive factors and other factors discussed in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report. These factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. See the section titled \"Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\" that appears at the beginning of this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are an industry leader in providing service assurance and security solutions that are used by customers worldwide to assure their digital business services against disruption. Service providers and enterprises, including local, state and federal government agencies, rely on our solutions to achieve the visibility necessary to optimize network performance, ensure the delivery of high-quality, mission-critical applications and services, gain timely insight into the end user experience and protect the network from attack. With our offerings, customers can quickly, efficiently and effectively identify and resolve issues that result in downtime, interruptions to services, poor service quality or compromised security, thereby driving compelling returns on their investments in their network and broader technology initiatives.\nOur operating results are influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the mix and quantity of products and services sold, pricing, costs of materials used in our products, growth in employee-related costs, including commissions, and the expansion of our operations. Factors that affect our ability to maximize our operating results include, but are not limited to, our ability to introduce and enhance existing products, the marketplace acceptance of those new or enhanced products, continued expansion into international markets, development of strategic partnerships, competition, successful acquisition integration efforts, and our ability to achieve expense reductions and make improvements in a highly competitive industry.\nResults Overview\nTotal revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 was primarily impacted by lower spending by customers in the service provider customer segment for both service assurance and DDoS solutions, and the timing of the divestiture of the HNT tools business in mid-September 2018.\nOur gross profit percentage remained flat during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 as compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.\nNet loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 was $73.3 million, as compared with net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 of $79.8 million, resulting in an increase in net loss of $153.1 million. The increase in net loss was primarily due to a $78.9 million decrease in the income tax benefit, a $35.9 million impairment charge of certain intangible assets related to the HNT tools business, a $13.5 million increase in restructuring charges due to the voluntary separation program, a $13.5 million increase in interest expense due to additional amounts drawn down on the credit facility as well as an increase in the average interest rate on the credit facility, and a $9.5 million loss on the divestiture of the HNT tools business during the twelve months ended March 31, 2019. This increase was partially offset by a net $9.0 million decrease in employee-related expenses as a result of a decrease in headcount partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation.\nAt March 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $487.0 million. This represents an increase of $39.2 million over the previous fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to $149.8 million in cash provided by operations during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, partially offset by $50.0 million used to repay long-term debt, $23.4 million used for capital expenditures, $14.5 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock, and $11.9 million used for tax withholdings on restricted stock units.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe supplement the United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures we report in quarterly and annual earnings announcements, investor presentations and other investor communications by reporting the following non-GAAP measures: non-GAAP total revenue, non-GAAP product revenue, non-GAAP service revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings before interest and other expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from operations, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per share (diluted). Non-GAAP revenue (total, product and service) eliminates the GAAP effects of acquisitions by adding back revenue related to deferred revenue revaluation, as well as revenue impacted by the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross profit includes the aforementioned revenue adjustments and also removes expenses related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based compensation, certain expenses relating to acquisitions including depreciation costs, compensation for post-combination services and business development and integration costs and adds back transitional service agreement income. Non-GAAP income from operations includes the aforementioned adjustments and also removes restructuring charges, intangible asset impairment charges, loss on divestiture and costs related to new accounting standard implementation. Non-GAAP EBITDA from operations includes the aforementioned items related to non-GAAP income from operations and also removes non-acquisition-related depreciation expense. Non-GAAP net income includes the foregoing adjustments related to non-GAAP income from operations, net of related income tax effects in addition to the provisional one-time impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) while removing transitional service agreement income and changes in contingent consideration. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share also excludes these expenses as well as the related impact of all these adjustments on the provision for income taxes.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with GAAP, should not be considered an alternative for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP (revenue, gross profit, operating profit, net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share), and may have limitations in that they do not reflect all our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The presentation of non-GAAP information is not meant to be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the reader's overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain financial measures and providing a level of disclosure that helps investors understand how we plan and measure our business. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared with our peer companies and also enables investors to consider our operating results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis during and following the integration period of our acquisitions. Presenting the GAAP measures on their own may not be indicative of our core operating results. Furthermore, management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding present and future business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following table reconciles revenue, gross profit, income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017: Table 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

acquisition accounting items, and share based compensation to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results. We apply significant judgment and create estimates when applying these policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with determining the amounts of product and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.\nWe derive revenues primarily from the sale of network management tools and security solutions for service provider and enterprise customers, which include hardware, software and service offerings. The majority of our product sales consist of hardware products with embedded software that are essential to providing customers the intended functionality of the solutions. We also sell software offerings decoupled from the underlying hardware and software solutions to provide customers with enhanced functionality.\nWe account for revenue once a legally enforceable contract with a customer has been approved by the parties and the related promises to transfer products or services have been identified. A contract is defined to us as an arrangement with commercial substance identifying payment terms, each party's rights and obligations regarding the products or services to be transferred and the amount we deem probable of collection. Customer contracts may include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether the products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as one combined performance obligation may require significant judgment. Revenue is recognized when control of the products or services are transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products and services.\nProduct revenue is typically recognized upon shipment, provided a legally enforceable contract exists, control has passed to the customer, and in the case of software products, when the customer has the rights and ability to access the software, and collection of the related receivable is probable. If any significant obligations to the customer remain post-delivery, typically involving obligations relating to installation and acceptance by the customer, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled. Our service offerings include installation, integration, extended warranty and maintenance services, post-contract customer support, stand-ready software-as-a-service (SAAS) and other professional services including consulting and training. We generally provide software and/or hardware support as part of product sales. Revenue related to the initial bundled software and hardware support is recognized ratably over the support period. In addition, customers can elect to purchase extended support agreements for periods after the initial software/hardware warranty expiration. Support services generally include rights to unspecified upgrades (when and if available), telephone and internet-based support, updates, bug fixes and hardware repair and replacement. Consulting services are recognized upon delivery or completion of performance\ndepending on the terms of the underlying contract. Reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing consulting services are included in services revenue, with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of service revenue. Training services include on-site and classroom training. Training revenues are recognized upon delivery of the training.\nGenerally, our contracts are accounted for individually. However, when contracts are closely interrelated and dependent on each other, it may be necessary to account for two or more contracts as one to reflect the substance of the group of contracts.\nBundled arrangements are concurrent customer purchases of a combination of our product and service offerings that may be delivered at various points in time. We allocate the transaction price among the performance obligations in an amount that depicts the relative standalone selling prices (SSP) of each obligation. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately based on the element's historical pricing. We also consider our overall pricing objectives and practices across different sales channels and geographies, and market conditions. Generally, we have established SSP for a majority of our service elements based on historical standalone sales. In certain instances, we have established SSP for services based upon an estimate of profitability and the underlying cost to fulfill those services. Further, for certain service engagements, we consider quoted prices as part of multi-element arrangements of those engagements as a basis for establishing SSP. SSP has been established for product elements as the average or median selling price the element was recently sold for, whether sold alone or sold as part of a multiple element transaction. We review sales of the product elements on a quarterly basis and update, when appropriate, SSP for such elements to ensure that it reflects recent pricing experience. Our products are distributed through our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels through alliances with resellers and distributors. Revenue arrangements with resellers and distributors are recognized on a sell-in basis; that is, when control of the product transfers to the reseller or distributor. We record consideration given to a reseller or distributor as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded revenue from the reseller or distributor. With limited exceptions, our return policy does not allow product returns for a refund. Returns have been insignificant to date. In addition, we have a history of successfully collecting receivables from our resellers and distributors.\nMarketable Securities\nWe measure the fair value of our marketable securities at the end of each reporting period. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Marketable securities are recorded at fair value and have been classified as Level 1 or 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in accessible active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves.\nValuation of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Acquisition and Divestiture Accounting Items\nWe amortize acquired definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but subject to annual impairment tests; more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would indicate a potential decline in their fair value. We perform the assessment annually during the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if potential impairment indicators arise. We have identified two reporting units: (1) Service Assurance and (2) Security.\nTo test impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired. If based on our qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, quantitative impairment testing is required. However, if we conclude otherwise, quantitative impairment testing is not required. During fiscal year 2019, we performed a quantitative analysis for goodwill. We determined the fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill using established income and market valuation approaches. Goodwill was estimated to be recoverable as of January 31, 2019.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually, or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets below its carrying value. To test impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible is impaired. If based on our qualitative assessment we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived asset is greater than its carrying amount, quantitative impairment testing is not required. We completed our annual impairment test of the indefinite-lived intangible asset at January 31, 2019 using the qualitative Step 0 assessment. No impairment indicators were observed as of January 31, 2019.\nWe completed two acquisitions and one divestiture during the three-year period ended March 31, 2019. The acquisition method of accounting requires an estimate of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired as part of these transactions. In order to estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets, we use a relief from royalty model which requires management to estimate: future revenues expected to be generated by the acquired intangible assets, a royalty rate which a market participant would pay related to the projected revenue stream, a present value factor which approximates a risk adjusted rate of return for a market participant purchasing the assets, and a technology migration curve representing a period of time over which the technology assets or some portion thereof are still being used. We are also required to develop the fair value for customer relationships acquired as part of these transactions which requires that we create estimates for the following items: a projection of future revenues associated with the acquired company's existing customers, a turnover rate for those customers, a margin related to those sales, and a risk adjusted rate of return for a market participant purchasing those relationships.\nWe have a contingent consideration asset related to the divestiture of our handheld network test (HNT) tools business in September 2018. The contingent consideration asset represents potential future earnout payments to us of up to $4.0 million over two years that are contingent on the HNT tools business achieving certain milestones. The fair value of the contingent consideration of $2.3 million was recognized on the acquisition date and was measured using observable (Level 3) inputs. The contingent consideration asset at March 31, 2019 was $0.8 million.\nWe had a contingent liability at March 31, 2018 for $523 thousand related to the acquisition of Efflux Systems, Inc. (Efflux) in July 2017 for which an escrow account was established to cover damages we may have suffered related to any liabilities that we did not agree to assume or as a result of the breach of representations and warranties of the seller as described in the merger agreement. The $523 thousand was paid to the seller in July 2018.\nWe had a contingent liability at March 31, 2018 for $4.9 million related to the acquisition of Simena LLC (Simena) in November 2011, which was based on the ultimate settlement of assets and liabilities acquired as part of the transaction, and the former owners' future period of employment with us. The contingent purchase consideration of $5.0 million was paid to the seller in November 2018.\nWe had $660 thousand of contingent purchase consideration related to the acquisition of Avvasi Incorporated (Avvasi) in August 2016 for which an escrow account was established to cover damages we may have suffered related to any liabilities that we did not agree to assume or as a result of the breach of representations and warranties of the seller as described in the asset purchase agreement. The $660 thousand was paid to the seller in August 2017.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation expense for all share-based payments. Under the fair value recognition provisions, we recognize share-based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.\nWe are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the share-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.\nBased on historical experience, we assumed an annualized forfeiture rate of 0% for awards granted to our directors, an annualized forfeiture rate of approximately 2% for awards granted to our senior executives, and an annualized forfeiture rate of approximately 5% for all remaining employees. We will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended March 31, 2019 and 2018\nRevenue\nProduct revenue consists of sales of our hardware products and licensing of our software products. Service revenue consists of customer support agreements, consulting, training and stand-ready software as a service offerings. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, no direct customer or indirect channel partner accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue.\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>467,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>520,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(53,129\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service\n</td> <td>442,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>466,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,740\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>909,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>986,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(76,869\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct.

The 11%, or $17.7 million, decrease in cost of product revenue compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a $17.8 million decrease in direct material costs due to shifts in product mix and the decrease in product revenue, a $6.4 million decrease in the amortization of intangible assets, a net $6.3 million decrease in employee-related expenses associated with the timing of certain projects partially offset by an increase in variable incentive compensation, and a $0.6 million decrease in shipping costs. These decreases were partially offset by an $11.6 million increase in costs to deliver model calibration products and a $1.8 million increase in capitalized overhead costs. The product gross profit percentage remained flat at 70% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The 10%, or $35.4 million decrease in product gross profit, corresponds with the 10%, or $53.1 million decrease in product revenue, partially offset by the 11%, or $17.7 million decrease in cost of product.\nService. The $0.1 million decrease in cost of service revenue was primarily due to an $8.5 million decrease in contractor fees, a $2.0 million decrease in travel expenses, and a $1.7 million decrease in expenses associated with the timing of certain projects. These decreases were almost entirely offset with a net $12.0 million increase in employee-related expenses associated with the timing of certain projects as well as an increase in variable incentive compensation partially offset by a decrease due to a reduction in headcount as a result of the voluntary separation program. The service gross profit percentage decreased by two percentage points to 74% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. The 7%, or $23.7 million, decrease in service gross profit corresponds with the 5%, or $23.7 million, decrease in service revenue, partially offset by the $0.1 million decrease in cost of services.\nGross profit. Our gross profit decreased 8%, or $59.1 million, compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. This decrease is attributable to the 8%, or $76.9 million, decrease in revenue offset by a $17.8 million, or 7%, decrease in cost of revenue.

Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, fees for outside consultants, overhead and related expenses associated with the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products.\nThe 5%, or $11.5 million, decrease in research and development expenses compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a net $4.5 million decrease in employee-related expense due to lower headcount partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation, a $4.3 million decrease in consulting fees, a $3.4 million decrease from depreciation expense and a $1.0 million decrease in travel expenses. These decreases were partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in expenses associated with the timing of certain projects.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses and commissions, overhead and other expenses associated with selling activities and marketing programs such as trade shows, seminars, advertising, and new product launch activities.\nThe 7%, or $20.7 million, decrease in total sales and marketing expenses compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a net $12.2 million decrease in employee-related expense due to lower headcount partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation, a $3.1 million decrease in trade shows and other events, a $2.4 million decrease in consulting fees, a $1.7 million decrease in travel expenses, a $1.4 million decrease in depreciation expense and a $1.0 million decrease in commissions expense. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.9 million increase in advertising expenses.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses for executive, financial, legal and human resource employees, overhead and other corporate expenditures.\nThe 15%, or $15.9 million, decrease in general and administrative expenses compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a $5.5 million decrease in legal expenses, a $3.6 million decrease in consulting fees, a $2.7 million decrease in tax related items, a $2.0 million decrease in rent and other facilities related expenses and a $1.5 million decrease in business development expenses. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in employee-related expenses primarily due to an increase in variable incentive compensation.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists primarily of amortization of customer relationships, definite-lived trademark and tradenames, and leasehold interest related to the Comms Transaction, ONPATH Technologies, Inc., Simena, Psytechnics, Ltd, Network General Corporation, Avvasi and Efflux.\nThe 3%, or $2.3 million, decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets was largely due to a decrease in amortization of the intangible assets related to the divestiture of the HNT tools business in September 2018.\nImpairment of intangible assets. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we performed a quantitative analysis on certain intangible assets related to the HNT tools business. The fair value of these intangible assets was determined to be less than the carrying value, and as a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $35.9 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.\nRestructuring. During fiscal year 2019 and 2018, we restructured certain departments to better align functions, drive productivity and improve efficiency. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we implemented a voluntary separation program (VSP) for employees who met certain age and service requirements to reduce overall headcount. As a result of the restructuring programs, we recorded $18.7 million and $5.2 million of restructuring charges related to one-time termination benefits as well as facility-related charges during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLoss of Divestiture of Business. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we recorded a $9.5 million loss on the divestiture of the HNT tools business.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net includes interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, interest expense and other non-operating gains or losses.\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other expense, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,332\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,601\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,731\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 46%, or $6.7 million, increase in interest and other expense, net was primarily due to a $13.3 million increase in interest expense due to additional amounts drawn down on the credit facility to fund the ASR as well as an increase in the average interest rate on the credit facility and a $1.6 million increase in other expense due to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration related to the HNT tools business divestiture. These increases were partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in interest income received on investments, a $2.2 million increase in transitional services agreement income related to the HNT tools business divestiture, and a $2.2 million decrease in foreign exchange expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe annual effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 was 21.1%, compared to an annual effective tax rate of 527.7% for fiscal year 2018. Generally, the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes, partially offset by the tax benefit associated with our domestic production activities deduction, research and development tax credits and earnings in jurisdictions subject to tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. The provisions of the TCJA that affect the Company's fiscal year 2019 tax rate include the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), the deduction for Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) and the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) inclusion. The effective tax rate for the twelve months ended March 31, 2019 is lower than the effective rate for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to the enactment of the TCJA during the prior fiscal year. As a result of the enactment, we recorded a significant tax benefit during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. This benefit has the effect of increasing the tax rate due to losses generated in the twelve months ended March 31, 2018.\nThere are several key provisions under the TCJA, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, that impact us. The final impact of the TCJA, as described below, did not differ from the estimates reported at December 31, 2017. The key changes from the TCJA that were reported as of March 31, 2019 are the impact due to the reduced U.S. Federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, a one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings on which U.S. income tax was deferred, additional tax expense under BEAT, a deduction for FDII, an income inclusion under GILTI and the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction.\nWe are required to record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the enacted tax rate which they are expected to reverse in the future. Therefore, any U.S. related deferred taxes were re-measured from 35.0% down to 21.0% based on the recorded balances. As of December 31, 2017, we recorded an estimate related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax balances, which was a benefit of approximately $87 million. During the third quarter of the current fiscal year we finalized our calculation and did not adjust our estimate recorded.\nAdditionally, we are required to calculate a one-time transition tax based on our total post-1986 foreign subsidiaries' earnings and profits that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. As of December 31, 2017, we recorded an estimate related to this one-time transition charge of approximately $2 million. During the third quarter of the current fiscal year we finalized our calculation and did not adjust our estimate recorded.\nWe are subject to the tax on the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). We are required to make an accounting policy election of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period\nexpense when incurred (the \"period cost method\") or (2) factoring such amounts into our measurement of our deferred taxes (the \"deferred method\"). We have elected to treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred (the \"period cost method\").\nAs a result of TCJA we expect that current and future foreign earnings may be repatriated tax efficiently. After fully assessing the impact of the TCJA, we have determined that our current and future foreign earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested where we can repatriate those earnings in a tax efficient manner acceptable to management and which comply with local statutory and operational requirements. Additionally, we intend a one-time repatriation of certain previously taxed historical earnings because of TCJA which can be repatriated in a tax efficient manner. We continue to assert that any remainder of its historical book basis in excess of tax basis will be permanently reinvested. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. taxes on these differences.\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,588\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(98,471\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Years Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\nRevenue\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, no direct customer or indirect channel partner accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue.

Generally, the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes, partially offset by the tax benefit associated with our domestic production activities deduction, research and development tax credits and earnings in jurisdictions subject to tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. The effective tax rate for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018 was higher than the effective rate for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to the enactment of the TCJA during the fiscal year. As a result of the enactment, we recorded a significant tax benefit during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. This benefit has the effect of increasing the tax rate due to losses generated in the twelve months ended March 31, 2018.\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(98,471\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(117,365\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(621\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nAt March 31, 2019, we had the following contractual obligations:\nPayment due by period (Dollars in thousands)\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1\nyear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>640,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>568,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconditional purchase obligations (2)\n</td> <td>49,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (3)\n</td> <td>98,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension benefit plan\n</td> <td>7,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>794,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>587,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt March 31, 2019, the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and the accrual for the related interest was $1.4 million.

If we determine that it is reasonably possible, but not probable, that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred, or if the amount of a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, then, in accordance with the authoritative guidance, we disclose the amount or range of estimated loss if the amount or range of estimated loss is material. Accounting for claims and contingencies requires us to use our judgment. We consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seek input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business.\nWe have a contingent consideration asset related to the divestiture of our HNT tools business in September 2018. The contingent consideration asset represents potential future earnout payments to us of up to $4.0 million over two years that are contingent on the HNT tools business achieving certain milestones. The fair value of the contingent consideration of $2.3 million was recognized on the acquisition date and was measured using observable (Level 3) inputs. The contingent consideration asset at March 31, 2019 was $0.8 million.\nWe had a contingent liability at March 31, 2018 for $523 thousand related to the acquisition of Efflux in July 2017 for which an escrow account was established to cover damages we may have suffered related to any liabilities that we did not agree to assume or as a result of the breach of representations and warranties of the seller as described in the merger agreement. The $523 thousand was paid to the seller in July 2018.\nWe had a contingent liability at March 31, 2018 for $4.9 million related to the acquisition of Simena in November 2011, which was based on the ultimate settlement of assets and liabilities acquired as part of the transaction, and the former owners' future period of employment with us. The contingent purchase consideration of $5.0 million was paid to the seller in November 2018.\nWe had $660 thousand of contingent purchase consideration related to the acquisition of Avvasi in August 2016 for which an escrow account was established to cover damages we may have suffered related to any liabilities that we did not agree to\nassume or as a result of the breach of representations and warranties of the seller as described in the asset purchase agreement. The $660 thousand was paid to the seller in August 2017.\nLegal - From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate expense with respect to any current legal proceedings and claims, if determined adversely, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs previously disclosed, in March 2016, Packet Intelligence LLC (Packet Intelligence or Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against us and two subsidiary entities in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas asserting infringement of five United States patents. Plaintiff's Complaint alleged that legacy Tektronix GeoProbe products, including the G10 and GeoBlade products, infringed these patents. We filed an Answer denying Plaintiff's allegations and asserting that Plaintiff's patents were, among other things, invalid, not infringed, and unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. In October 2017, a jury trial was held to address the parties' claims and counterclaims regarding infringement of three patents by the G10 and GeoBlade products, invalidity of these patents, and damages. On October 13, 2017, the jury rendered a verdict finding in favor of the Plaintiff and that Plaintiff was entitled to $3,500,000 for pre-suit damages and $2,250,000 for post-suit damages. The jury indicated that the awarded damages amounts were intended to reflect a running royalty. The Court also conducted a bench trial on whether these patents were unenforceable due to, among other things, inequitable conduct. In September 2018, the Court entered judgment and \"enhanced\" the jury verdict in the amount of $2.8 million as a result of a jury finding. The judgment also awards pre- and post- judgment interest, and a running royalty on the G10 and GeoBlade products until the expiration of the patents at issue, the last date being June 2022. The Court denied the Plaintiff's motion for fees. Following the entry of judgment, we filed motions for judgment as a matter of law, seeking to both overturn the verdict and to reduce damages. We have concluded that the risk of loss from this matter is currently neither remote nor probable, and therefore, under GAAP definitions, the risk of loss is termed \"reasonably possible\". Therefore, accounting rules require us to provide an estimate for the range of potential liability. We currently estimate that the estimated range of liability is between $0 and the aggregate amount awarded by the jury and the Court's award of enhanced damages, plus potential additional pre- and post-judgment interest amounts and costs and any royalties owed on post-trial sales of the accused G10 and GeoBlade products. We intend to continue to vigorously dispute Packet Intelligence's claims including through appeal, if necessary.\nWarranty and Indemnification\nWe warrant that our software and hardware products will substantially conform to the documentation accompanying such products on their original date of shipment. For software, which also includes firmware, the standard warranty commences upon shipment and generally expires 60 to 90 days thereafter. With regard to hardware, the standard warranty commences upon shipment and generally expires 60 days to 12 months thereafter. Additionally, this warranty is subject to various exclusions which include, but are not limited to, non-conformance resulting from modifications made to the software or hardware by a party other than NetScout; customers' failure to follow our installation, operation or maintenance instructions; and events outside of our reasonable control. We also warrant that all support services will be performed in a good and workmanlike manner. We believe that our product and support service warranties are consistent with commonly accepted industry standards. Warranty cost information is presented and no material warranty costs are accrued since service revenue associated with warranty is deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably over the warranty period.\nContracts that we enter into in the ordinary course of business may contain standard indemnification provisions. Pursuant to these agreements, we may agree to defend third party claims brought against a partner or direct customer claiming infringement of such third party's (i) U.S. patent and/or European Union (EU), or other selected countries' patents, (ii) Berne convention member country copyright, and/or (iii) U.S., EU, and/or other selected countries' trademark or intellectual property rights. Moreover, this indemnity may require us to pay any damages awarded against the partner or direct customer in such type of lawsuit as well as reimburse the partner or direct customer for reasonable attorney's fees incurred by them from the lawsuit.\nWe may also agree from time to time to provide other forms of indemnification to partners or direct customers, such as indemnification that would obligate us to defend and pay any damages awarded to a third party against a partner or direct customer based on a lawsuit alleging that such third party has suffered personal injury or tangible property damage legally determined to have been caused by negligently designed or manufactured products.\nWe have agreed to indemnify our directors and officers and our subsidiaries' directors and officers if they are made a party or are threatened to be made a party to any proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of NetScout) by reason of the fact that the indemnified are agents of NetScout. The indemnity is for any and all expenses and liabilities of any type (including but not limited to, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by the directors or officers in connection with the investigation, defense, settlement or appeal of such proceeding, provided they acted in good faith.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of the following (in thousands):\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>At March 31,\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>409,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>369,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>304,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term marketable securities\n</td> <td>76,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term marketable securities\n</td> <td>1,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>486,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>447,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>464,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\nAt March 31, 2019 cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (current and non-current) totaled $487.0 million, a $39.2 million increase from $447.8 million at March 31, 2018.

These decreases were partially offset by a $94.3 million increase from deferred income taxes, a $37.7 million increase from accrued compensation and other expenses, a $35.9 million increase due to the impairment of certain intangible assets, a $23.3 million increase from deferred revenue, a $9.0 million increase from share based compensation expense associated with equity awards, a $7.7 million increase in loss on divestiture of business, a $5.1 million increase from accounts payable, a $4.3 million increase from inventories, and a $2.1 million increase from income tax payable.

As a result, we received an additional 3,679,947 shares of common stock for $96.8 million, which reduced the number of shares available to be purchased from the twenty-five million share repurchase program during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. In total, 11,067,809 shares of our common stock were repurchased under the ASR at an average cost per share of $27.11.\nIn connection with the delivery of common shares upon vesting of restricted stock units, we have withheld 451,683 shares for $11.9 million, 408,097 shares for $13.6 million and 320,572 shares for $9.6 million related to minimum statutory tax withholding requirements on these restricted stock units during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These withholding transactions do not fall under the repurchase program described above, and therefore do not reduce the amount that is available for repurchase under that program.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we repaid $50.0 million of borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nCredit Facility\nOn January 16, 2018, we amended and expanded our existing credit agreement (Amended Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of lenders by and among: NetScout; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMorgan), as administrative agent and collateral agent; J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, RBC Capital Markets and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners; Fifth Third Bank, Santander Bank, N.A., SunTrust Bank, N.A. and U.S. Bank National Association, as co-documentation agents; and the lenders party thereto.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement provides for a five-year $1.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility, including a letter of credit sub-facility of up to $75.0 million. We may elect to use the new credit facility for general corporate purposes or to finance the repurchase of up to twenty-five million shares of common stock under our common stock repurchase plan. The commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement will expire on January 16, 2023, and any outstanding loans will be due on that date. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we repaid $50.0 million of borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement. At March 31, 2019, $550 million was outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nAt our election, revolving loans under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at either (a) an Alternate Base Rate per annum equal to the greatest of (1) JPMorgan's prime rate, (2) 0.50% in excess of the New York Federal Reserve Bank (NYFRB) rate, or (3) an adjusted one month LIBOR rate plus 1%; or (b) such adjusted LIBOR rate (for the interest period selected by us), in each case plus an applicable margin. For the period from the delivery of our financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, until we have delivered financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, the applicable margin will be 1.75% per annum for LIBOR loans and 0.75% per annum for Alternate Base Rate loans, and thereafter the applicable margin will vary depending on our leverage ratio, ranging from 1.00% per annum for Base Rate loans and 2.00% per annum for LIBOR loans if our consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 3.50 to 1.00, down to 0.00% per annum for Alternate Base Rate loans and 1.00% per annum for LIBOR loans if our consolidated leverage ratio is equal to or less than 1.50 to 1.00.\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Our Amended Credit Agreement provides for the Administrative Agent to determine if (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR rate or (ii) the FCA or Government Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the LIBOR rate shall no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans and the Administrative Agent determines that (i) and (ii) above are unlikely to be temporary then the Administrative Agent and NetScout would agree to transition to an Alternate Base Rate Borrowing or amend the Credit Agreement to establish an alternate rate of interest to LIBOR that gives due consideration to the then prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest for syndicated loans in the United States at such time.\nOur consolidated leverage ratio is the ratio of our total funded debt compared to our consolidated adjusted EBITDA. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA includes certain adjustments, including, without limitation, adjustments relating to extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring charges, certain restructuring charges, non-cash charges, certain transaction costs and expenses and certain pro forma adjustments in connection with material acquisitions and dispositions, all as set forth in detail in the definition of consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the Amended Credit Agreement.\nCommitment fees will accrue on the daily unused amount of the credit facility. For the period from the delivery of our financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 until we have delivered financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, the commitment fee will be 0.30% per annum, and thereafter the commitment fee will vary depending on the our consolidated leverage ratio, ranging from 0.30% per annum if our consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 2.75 to 1.00, down to 0.15% per annum if our consolidated leverage ratio is equal to or less than 1.50 to 1.00.\nLetter of credit participation fees are payable to each lender on the amount of such lender's letter of credit exposure, during the period from the closing date of the Amended Credit Agreement to but excluding the date which is the later of (i) the date on which such lender's commitment terminates or (ii) the date on which such lender ceases to have any letter of credit exposure, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR loans. Additionally, we will pay a fronting fee to each issuing bank in amounts to be agreed to between us and the applicable issuing bank.\nInterest on Alternate Base Rate loans is payable at the end of each calendar quarter. Interest on LIBOR loans is payable at the end of each interest rate period or at the end of each three-month interval within an interest rate period if the period is longer than three months. We may also prepay loans under the Amended Credit Agreement at any time, without penalty, subject to certain notice requirements.\nDebt is recorded at the amount drawn on the revolving credit facility plus interest based on floating rates reflective of changes in the market which approximates fair value.\nThe loans and other obligations under the credit facility are (a) guaranteed by each of our wholly owned material domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, and (b) are secured by substantially all of the assets of us and the subsidiary guarantors, including a pledge of all the capital stock of material subsidiaries held directly by us and the subsidiary guarantors (which pledge, in the case of any foreign subsidiary, is limited to 65% of the voting stock), subject to certain customary exceptions and limitations. The Amended Credit Agreement generally prohibits any other liens on the assets of NetScout and its restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions as described in the Amended Credit Agreement.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement contains certain covenants applicable to us and our restricted subsidiaries, including, without limitation, limitations on additional indebtedness, liens, various fundamental changes, dividends and distributions,\ninvestments (including acquisitions), transactions with affiliates, asset sales, including sale-leaseback transactions, speculative hedge agreements, payment of junior financing, changes in business and other limitations customary in senior secured credit facilities. In addition, we are required to maintain certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios. These covenants and limitations are more fully described in the Amended Credit Agreement. At March 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement provides that events of default will exist in certain circumstances, including failure to make payment of principal or interest on the loans when required, failure to perform certain obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement and related documents, defaults under certain other indebtedness, certain insolvency events, certain events arising under ERISA, a change of control and certain other events. Upon an event of default, the administrative agent with the consent of, or at the request of, the holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the loans and commitments may terminate the commitments and accelerate the maturity of the loans and enforce certain other remedies under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents.\nIn connection with NetScout's Amended Credit Agreement described above, we terminated our previous term loan dated as of July 14, 2015, by and among NetScout; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMorgan), as administrative agent and collateral agent; J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, RBC Capital Markets and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners; Santander Bank, N.A., SunTrust Bank, N.A. and U.S. Bank National Association, as co-documentation agents; and the lenders party thereto.\nWe capitalized debt issuance costs totaling $12.2 million at March 31, 2019, which are being amortized over the life of the revolving credit facility. The unamortized balance was $6.6 million as of March 31, 2019. The balance of $1.7 million was included as prepaid expenses and other current assets and a balance of $4.9 million was included as other assets in our consolidated balance sheet.\nExpectations for Fiscal Year 2020\nWe believe that our cash balances, available debt, short-term marketable securities classified as available-for-sale and future cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.\nAdditionally, a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies. From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses, products or technologies. If our existing sources of liquidity are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities. The sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, See Note 2 contained in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to comprehend the table you have provided since it appears to be incomplete.\n\n- Could you please double-check that all of the necessary cells have values and that they are all contained within the table?

"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial information and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Actual events or results may differ materially due to competitive factors and other factors discussed in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report. These factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. See the section titled \"Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\" that appears at the beginning of this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are an industry leader in providing service assurance and security solutions that are used by customers worldwide to assure their digital business services against disruption. Service providers and enterprises, including local, state and federal government agencies, rely on our solutions to achieve the visibility necessary to optimize network performance, ensure the delivery of high-quality, mission-critical applications and services, gain timely insight into the end user experience and protect the network from attack. With our offerings, customers can quickly, efficiently and effectively identify and resolve issues that result in downtime, interruptions to services, poor service quality or compromised security, thereby driving compelling returns on their investments in their network and broader technology initiatives.\nOur operating results are influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the mix and quantity of products and services sold, pricing, costs of materials used in our products, growth in employee-related costs, including commissions, and the expansion of our operations. Factors that affect our ability to maximize our operating results include, but are not limited to, our ability to introduce and enhance existing products, the marketplace acceptance of those new or enhanced products, continued expansion into international markets, development of strategic partnerships, competition, successful acquisition integration efforts, and our ability to achieve expense reductions and make improvements in a highly competitive industry.\nResults Overview\nTotal revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 was primarily impacted by lower spending by customers in the service provider customer segment for both service assurance and DDoS solutions, and the timing of the divestiture of the HNT tools business in mid-September 2018.\nOur gross profit percentage remained flat during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 as compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.\nNet loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 was $73.3 million, as compared with net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 of $79.8 million, resulting in an increase in net loss of $153.1 million. The increase in net loss was primarily due to a $78.9 million decrease in the income tax benefit, a $35.9 million impairment charge of certain intangible assets related to the HNT tools business, a $13.5 million increase in restructuring charges due to the voluntary separation program, a $13.5 million increase in interest expense due to additional amounts drawn down on the credit facility as well as an increase in the average interest rate on the credit facility, and a $9.5 million loss on the divestiture of the HNT tools business during the twelve months ended March 31, 2019. This increase was partially offset by a net $9.0 million decrease in employee-related expenses as a result of a decrease in headcount partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation.\nAt March 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $487.0 million. This represents an increase of $39.2 million over the previous fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to $149.8 million in cash provided by operations during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, partially offset by $50.0 million used to repay long-term debt, $23.4 million used for capital expenditures, $14.5 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock, and $11.9 million used for tax withholdings on restricted stock units.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe supplement the United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures we report in quarterly and annual earnings announcements, investor presentations and other investor communications by reporting the following non-GAAP measures: non-GAAP total revenue, non-GAAP product revenue, non-GAAP service revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings before interest and other expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from operations, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per share (diluted). Non-GAAP revenue (total, product and service) eliminates the GAAP effects of acquisitions by adding back revenue related to deferred revenue revaluation, as well as revenue impacted by the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross profit includes the aforementioned revenue adjustments and also removes expenses related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based compensation, certain expenses relating to acquisitions including depreciation costs, compensation for post-combination services and business development and integration costs and adds back transitional service agreement income. Non-GAAP income from operations includes the aforementioned adjustments and also removes restructuring charges, intangible asset impairment charges, loss on divestiture and costs related to new accounting standard implementation. Non-GAAP EBITDA from operations includes the aforementioned items related to non-GAAP income from operations and also removes non-acquisition-related depreciation expense. Non-GAAP net income includes the foregoing adjustments related to non-GAAP income from operations, net of related income tax effects in addition to the provisional one-time impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) while removing transitional service agreement income and changes in contingent consideration. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share also excludes these expenses as well as the related impact of all these adjustments on the provision for income taxes.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with GAAP, should not be considered an alternative for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP (revenue, gross profit, operating profit, net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share), and may have limitations in that they do not reflect all our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The presentation of non-GAAP information is not meant to be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the reader's overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain financial measures and providing a level of disclosure that helps investors understand how we plan and measure our business. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared with our peer companies and also enables investors to consider our operating results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis during and following the integration period of our acquisitions. Presenting the GAAP measures on their own may not be indicative of our core operating results. Furthermore, management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding present and future business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following table reconciles revenue, gross profit, income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017: \n\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe consider accounting policies related to revenue recognition, marketable securities, valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and other acquisition accounting items, and share based compensation to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results. We apply significant judgment and create estimates when applying these policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with determining the amounts of product and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.\nWe derive revenues primarily from the sale of network management tools and security solutions for service provider and enterprise customers, which include hardware, software and service offerings. The majority of our product sales consist of hardware products with embedded software that are essential to providing customers the intended functionality of the solutions. We also sell software offerings decoupled from the underlying hardware and software solutions to provide customers with enhanced functionality.\nWe account for revenue once a legally enforceable contract with a customer has been approved by the parties and the related promises to transfer products or services have been identified. A contract is defined to us as an arrangement with commercial substance identifying payment terms, each party's rights and obligations regarding the products or services to be transferred and the amount we deem probable of collection. Customer contracts may include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether the products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as one combined performance obligation may require significant judgment. Revenue is recognized when control of the products or services are transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products and services.\nProduct revenue is typically recognized upon shipment, provided a legally enforceable contract exists, control has passed to the customer, and in the case of software products, when the customer has the rights and ability to access the software, and collection of the related receivable is probable. If any significant obligations to the customer remain post-delivery, typically involving obligations relating to installation and acceptance by the customer, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled. Our service offerings include installation, integration, extended warranty and maintenance services, post-contract customer support, stand-ready software-as-a-service (SAAS) and other professional services including consulting and training. We generally provide software and/or hardware support as part of product sales. Revenue related to the initial bundled software and hardware support is recognized ratably over the support period. In addition, customers can elect to purchase extended support agreements for periods after the initial software/hardware warranty expiration. Support services generally include rights to unspecified upgrades (when and if available), telephone and internet-based support, updates, bug fixes and hardware repair and replacement. Consulting services are recognized upon delivery or completion of performance\ndepending on the terms of the underlying contract. Reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing consulting services are included in services revenue, with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of service revenue. Training services include on-site and classroom training. Training revenues are recognized upon delivery of the training.\nGenerally, our contracts are accounted for individually. However, when contracts are closely interrelated and dependent on each other, it may be necessary to account for two or more contracts as one to reflect the substance of the group of contracts.\nBundled arrangements are concurrent customer purchases of a combination of our product and service offerings that may be delivered at various points in time. We allocate the transaction price among the performance obligations in an amount that depicts the relative standalone selling prices (SSP) of each obligation. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately based on the element's historical pricing. We also consider our overall pricing objectives and practices across different sales channels and geographies, and market conditions. Generally, we have established SSP for a majority of our service elements based on historical standalone sales. In certain instances, we have established SSP for services based upon an estimate of profitability and the underlying cost to fulfill those services. Further, for certain service engagements, we consider quoted prices as part of multi-element arrangements of those engagements as a basis for establishing SSP. SSP has been established for product elements as the average or median selling price the element was recently sold for, whether sold alone or sold as part of a multiple element transaction. We review sales of the product elements on a quarterly basis and update, when appropriate, SSP for such elements to ensure that it reflects recent pricing experience. Our products are distributed through our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels through alliances with resellers and distributors. Revenue arrangements with resellers and distributors are recognized on a sell-in basis; that is, when control of the product transfers to the reseller or distributor. We record consideration given to a reseller or distributor as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded revenue from the reseller or distributor. With limited exceptions, our return policy does not allow product returns for a refund. Returns have been insignificant to date. In addition, we have a history of successfully collecting receivables from our resellers and distributors.\nMarketable Securities\nWe measure the fair value of our marketable securities at the end of each reporting period. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Marketable securities are recorded at fair value and have been classified as Level 1 or 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in accessible active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves.\nValuation of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Acquisition and Divestiture Accounting Items\nWe amortize acquired definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but subject to annual impairment tests; more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would indicate a potential decline in their fair value. We perform the assessment annually during the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if potential impairment indicators arise. We have identified two reporting units: (1) Service Assurance and (2) Security.\nTo test impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired. If based on our qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, quantitative impairment testing is required. However, if we conclude otherwise, quantitative impairment testing is not required. During fiscal year 2019, we performed a quantitative analysis for goodwill. We determined the fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill using established income and market valuation approaches. Goodwill was estimated to be recoverable as of January 31, 2019.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually, or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets below its carrying value. To test impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible is impaired. If based on our qualitative assessment we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived asset is greater than its carrying amount, quantitative impairment testing is not required. We completed our annual impairment test of the indefinite-lived intangible asset at January 31, 2019 using the qualitative Step 0 assessment. No impairment indicators were observed as of January 31, 2019.\nWe completed two acquisitions and one divestiture during the three-year period ended March 31, 2019. The acquisition method of accounting requires an estimate of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired as part of these transactions. In order to estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets, we use a relief from royalty model which requires management to estimate: future revenues expected to be generated by the acquired intangible assets, a royalty rate which a market participant would pay related to the projected revenue stream, a present value factor which approximates a risk adjusted rate of return for a market participant purchasing the assets, and a technology migration curve representing a period of time over which the technology assets or some portion thereof are still being used. We are also required to develop the fair value for customer relationships acquired as part of these transactions which requires that we create estimates for the following items: a projection of future revenues associated with the acquired company's existing customers, a turnover rate for those customers, a margin related to those sales, and a risk adjusted rate of return for a market participant purchasing those relationships.\nWe have a contingent consideration asset related to the divestiture of our handheld network test (HNT) tools business in September 2018. The contingent consideration asset represents potential future earnout payments to us of up to $4.0 million over two years that are contingent on the HNT tools business achieving certain milestones. The fair value of the contingent consideration of $2.3 million was recognized on the acquisition date and was measured using observable (Level 3) inputs. The contingent consideration asset at March 31, 2019 was $0.8 million.\nWe had a contingent liability at March 31, 2018 for $523 thousand related to the acquisition of Efflux Systems, Inc. (Efflux) in July 2017 for which an escrow account was established to cover damages we may have suffered related to any liabilities that we did not agree to assume or as a result of the breach of representations and warranties of the seller as described in the merger agreement. The $523 thousand was paid to the seller in July 2018.\nWe had a contingent liability at March 31, 2018 for $4.9 million related to the acquisition of Simena LLC (Simena) in November 2011, which was based on the ultimate settlement of assets and liabilities acquired as part of the transaction, and the former owners' future period of employment with us. The contingent purchase consideration of $5.0 million was paid to the seller in November 2018.\nWe had $660 thousand of contingent purchase consideration related to the acquisition of Avvasi Incorporated (Avvasi) in August 2016 for which an escrow account was established to cover damages we may have suffered related to any liabilities that we did not agree to assume or as a result of the breach of representations and warranties of the seller as described in the asset purchase agreement. The $660 thousand was paid to the seller in August 2017.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation expense for all share-based payments. Under the fair value recognition provisions, we recognize share-based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.\nWe are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the share-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.\nBased on historical experience, we assumed an annualized forfeiture rate of 0% for awards granted to our directors, an annualized forfeiture rate of approximately 2% for awards granted to our senior executives, and an annualized forfeiture rate of approximately 5% for all remaining employees. We will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended March 31, 2019 and 2018\nRevenue\nProduct revenue consists of sales of our hardware products and licensing of our software products. Service revenue consists of customer support agreements, consulting, training and stand-ready software as a service offerings. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, no direct customer or indirect channel partner accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue.\n\nProduct. The 10%, or $53.1 million, decrease in product revenue compared with the same period last year was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from service provider customers for both the service assurance and security offerings, as well as lower enterprise-related product revenue tied to the divestiture of the HNT tools business.\nService. The 5%, or $23.7 million, decrease in service revenue compared to the same period last year was primarily due to lower professional services revenue, a reduction of support renewals on non-core product lines, as well as the divestiture of the HNT tools business.\nTotal revenue by geography is as follows:\n\nUnited States revenue decreased 5%, or $28.6 million, primarily due to declines in both service assurance and cybersecurity products, as well as the divestiture of the HNT tools business. International revenue decreased 12%, or $43.8 million, primarily due to declines in both service assurance and cybersecurity products, as well as the divestiture of the HNT tools business.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nCost of product revenue consists primarily of material components, manufacturing personnel expenses, packaging materials, overhead and amortization of capitalized software, acquired developed technology and core technology. Cost of service revenue consists primarily of personnel, material, overhead and support costs.\n\nProduct. The 11%, or $17.7 million, decrease in cost of product revenue compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a $17.8 million decrease in direct material costs due to shifts in product mix and the decrease in product revenue, a $6.4 million decrease in the amortization of intangible assets, a net $6.3 million decrease in employee-related expenses associated with the timing of certain projects partially offset by an increase in variable incentive compensation, and a $0.6 million decrease in shipping costs. These decreases were partially offset by an $11.6 million increase in costs to deliver model calibration products and a $1.8 million increase in capitalized overhead costs. The product gross profit percentage remained flat at 70% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The 10%, or $35.4 million decrease in product gross profit, corresponds with the 10%, or $53.1 million decrease in product revenue, partially offset by the 11%, or $17.7 million decrease in cost of product.\nService. The $0.1 million decrease in cost of service revenue was primarily due to an $8.5 million decrease in contractor fees, a $2.0 million decrease in travel expenses, and a $1.7 million decrease in expenses associated with the timing of certain projects. These decreases were almost entirely offset with a net $12.0 million increase in employee-related expenses associated with the timing of certain projects as well as an increase in variable incentive compensation partially offset by a decrease due to a reduction in headcount as a result of the voluntary separation program. The service gross profit percentage decreased by two percentage points to 74% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. The 7%, or $23.7 million, decrease in service gross profit corresponds with the 5%, or $23.7 million, decrease in service revenue, partially offset by the $0.1 million decrease in cost of services.\nGross profit. Our gross profit decreased 8%, or $59.1 million, compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. This decrease is attributable to the 8%, or $76.9 million, decrease in revenue offset by a $17.8 million, or 7%, decrease in cost of revenue. The gross margin percentage remained flat at 72% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year.\nOperating Expenses\n\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, fees for outside consultants, overhead and related expenses associated with the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products.\nThe 5%, or $11.5 million, decrease in research and development expenses compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a net $4.5 million decrease in employee-related expense due to lower headcount partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation, a $4.3 million decrease in consulting fees, a $3.4 million decrease from depreciation expense and a $1.0 million decrease in travel expenses. These decreases were partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in expenses associated with the timing of certain projects.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses and commissions, overhead and other expenses associated with selling activities and marketing programs such as trade shows, seminars, advertising, and new product launch activities.\nThe 7%, or $20.7 million, decrease in total sales and marketing expenses compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a net $12.2 million decrease in employee-related expense due to lower headcount partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation, a $3.1 million decrease in trade shows and other events, a $2.4 million decrease in consulting fees, a $1.7 million decrease in travel expenses, a $1.4 million decrease in depreciation expense and a $1.0 million decrease in commissions expense. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.9 million increase in advertising expenses.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses for executive, financial, legal and human resource employees, overhead and other corporate expenditures.\nThe 15%, or $15.9 million, decrease in general and administrative expenses compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a $5.5 million decrease in legal expenses, a $3.6 million decrease in consulting fees, a $2.7 million decrease in tax related items, a $2.0 million decrease in rent and other facilities related expenses and a $1.5 million decrease in business development expenses. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in employee-related expenses primarily due to an increase in variable incentive compensation.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists primarily of amortization of customer relationships, definite-lived trademark and tradenames, and leasehold interest related to the Comms Transaction, ONPATH Technologies, Inc., Simena, Psytechnics, Ltd, Network General Corporation, Avvasi and Efflux.\nThe 3%, or $2.3 million, decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets was largely due to a decrease in amortization of the intangible assets related to the divestiture of the HNT tools business in September 2018.\nImpairment of intangible assets. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we performed a quantitative analysis on certain intangible assets related to the HNT tools business. The fair value of these intangible assets was determined to be less than the carrying value, and as a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $35.9 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.\nRestructuring. During fiscal year 2019 and 2018, we restructured certain departments to better align functions, drive productivity and improve efficiency. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we implemented a voluntary separation program (VSP) for employees who met certain age and service requirements to reduce overall headcount. As a result of the restructuring programs, we recorded $18.7 million and $5.2 million of restructuring charges related to one-time termination benefits as well as facility-related charges during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLoss of Divestiture of Business. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we recorded a $9.5 million loss on the divestiture of the HNT tools business.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net includes interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, interest expense and other non-operating gains or losses.\n\nThe 46%, or $6.7 million, increase in interest and other expense, net was primarily due to a $13.3 million increase in interest expense due to additional amounts drawn down on the credit facility to fund the ASR as well as an increase in the average interest rate on the credit facility and a $1.6 million increase in other expense due to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration related to the HNT tools business divestiture. These increases were partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in interest income received on investments, a $2.2 million increase in transitional services agreement income related to the HNT tools business divestiture, and a $2.2 million decrease in foreign exchange expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe annual effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 was 21.1%, compared to an annual effective tax rate of 527.7% for fiscal year 2018. Generally, the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes, partially offset by the tax benefit associated with our domestic production activities deduction, research and development tax credits and earnings in jurisdictions subject to tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. The provisions of the TCJA that affect the Company's fiscal year 2019 tax rate include the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), the deduction for Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) and the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) inclusion. The effective tax rate for the twelve months ended March 31, 2019 is lower than the effective rate for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to the enactment of the TCJA during the prior fiscal year. As a result of the enactment, we recorded a significant tax benefit during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. This benefit has the effect of increasing the tax rate due to losses generated in the twelve months ended March 31, 2018.\nThere are several key provisions under the TCJA, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, that impact us. The final impact of the TCJA, as described below, did not differ from the estimates reported at December 31, 2017. The key changes from the TCJA that were reported as of March 31, 2019 are the impact due to the reduced U.S. Federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, a one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings on which U.S. income tax was deferred, additional tax expense under BEAT, a deduction for FDII, an income inclusion under GILTI and the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction.\nWe are required to record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the enacted tax rate which they are expected to reverse in the future. Therefore, any U.S. related deferred taxes were re-measured from 35.0% down to 21.0% based on the recorded balances. As of December 31, 2017, we recorded an estimate related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax balances, which was a benefit of approximately $87 million. During the third quarter of the current fiscal year we finalized our calculation and did not adjust our estimate recorded.\nAdditionally, we are required to calculate a one-time transition tax based on our total post-1986 foreign subsidiaries' earnings and profits that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. As of December 31, 2017, we recorded an estimate related to this one-time transition charge of approximately $2 million. During the third quarter of the current fiscal year we finalized our calculation and did not adjust our estimate recorded.\nWe are subject to the tax on the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). We are required to make an accounting policy election of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period\nexpense when incurred (the \"period cost method\") or (2) factoring such amounts into our measurement of our deferred taxes (the \"deferred method\"). We have elected to treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred (the \"period cost method\").\nAs a result of TCJA we expect that current and future foreign earnings may be repatriated tax efficiently. After fully assessing the impact of the TCJA, we have determined that our current and future foreign earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested where we can repatriate those earnings in a tax efficient manner acceptable to management and which comply with local statutory and operational requirements. Additionally, we intend a one-time repatriation of certain previously taxed historical earnings because of TCJA which can be repatriated in a tax efficient manner. We continue to assert that any remainder of its historical book basis in excess of tax basis will be permanently reinvested. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. taxes on these differences.\n\nComparison of Years Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\nRevenue\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, no direct customer or indirect channel partner accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, one direct customer, Verizon, accounted for more than 10% of total revenue, while no indirect channel partner accounted for more than 10% of total revenue.\n\nProduct. The 27%, or $195.0 million, decrease in product revenue compared with the same period last year was primarily due to the combination of lower product revenue from a large tier-one service provider, and to a lesser extent, lower-than expected orders for service assurance and DDoS offerings by other service providers primarily in North America, as well as lower product revenue from enterprise customers.\nService. The 4%, or $19.7 million, increase in service revenue compared to the same period last year was primarily due to an increase in maintenance contracts.\nTotal revenue by geography is as follows:\n\nUnited States revenue decreased 19%, or $140.6 million, primarily due to the decrease in revenue from service assurance products.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\n\nProduct. The 32%, or $74.6 million, decrease in cost of product revenue was primarily due to a $62.7 million decrease in direct material costs due to shifts in product mix and the decrease in product revenue, a $3.7 million decrease in the amortization of intangibles, a $2.5 million decrease in employee-related expenses primarily due to a decrease in variable incentive compensation, a $2.3 million decrease in expenses related to the transitional service agreements related to the Comms Transaction, a $1.8 million decrease in capitalized overhead and a $1.7 million decrease in shipping costs. The product gross profit percentage increased by three percentage points to 70% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The 25%, or $120.3 million, decrease in product gross profit corresponds with the 27%, or $195.0 million decrease in product revenue, partially offset by the 32%, or $74.6 million decrease in cost of product.\nService. The $0.4 million increase in cost of service revenue was primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in contractor fees, and a $0.8 million increase in depreciation expense. These increases were partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in expenses associated with certain projects, and a $1.1 million decrease in employee-related expenses primarily due to a decrease in variable incentive compensation. The service gross profit percentage increased by one percentage points to 76% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the twelve months ended March 31, 2017. The 6%, or $19.2 million, increase in service gross profit corresponds with the 4%, or $19.7 million, increase in service revenue, partially offset by the $0.4 million increase in cost of services.\nGross profit. Our gross profit decreased 12%, or $101.1 million. This decrease is attributable to our decrease in revenue of 15%, or $175.3 million, partially offset by a $74.2 million, or 21%, decrease in cost of revenue. The gross margin percentage increased two percentage points to 72% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year.\nOperating Expenses\n\nResearch and development. The 8%, or $17.6 million, decrease in research and development expenses compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a $13.5 million decrease in employee-related expenses largely due to a decrease in variable incentive compensation, a $5.3 million decrease in consulting fees, a $1.4 million decrease from depreciation expense and a $1.1 million decrease in compensation for post-combination services. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.2 million increase from capitalized software costs. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, there were higher costs capitalized for software development.\nSales and marketing. The 5%, or $16.1 million, decrease in total sales and marketing expenses compared to the same period last year was primarily due to an $18.0 million decrease in commissions expense, a $5.8 million decrease in trade shows and other events, and a $1.4 million decrease in compensation for post-combination services. These decreases were partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in employee-related expenses and a $2.6 million increase in depreciation expense.\nGeneral and administrative. The 8%, or $9.0 million, decrease in general and administrative expenses compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a $9.5 million decrease in business development expenses, a $3.0 million decrease in employee-related expenses primarily due to a decrease in variable incentive compensation, a $1.9 million decrease in expenses related to the transitional services agreements related to the Comms Transaction and a $1.4 million decrease in legal expenses. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.8 million increase in consulting fees related to the implementation of new accounting standards, a $1.7 million increase in bad debt expense and a $1.7 million increase in rent expense.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets. The 9%, or $6.5 million, increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets was primarily due to an increase of $3.5 million due to the acceleration of certain intangibles related to the Comms Transaction, with the remaining increase due to changes in percentages of amortization related to the Comms Transaction.\nRestructuring. During fiscal year 2018 and 2017, we restructured certain departments to better align functions, drive productivity and improve efficiency. As a result of the restructuring programs, we recorded $5.2 million and $4.0 million of restructuring charges related to costs to be paid to employees for one-time termination benefits as well as facility-related charges during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\n\nThe 48%, or $4.7 million, increase in interest and other expense, net was primarily due to a $3.5 million increase in interest expense due to additional amounts drawn down on the credit facility entered into on January 16, 2018 as well as an increase in the average interest rate and a $1.6 million increase in foreign currency exchange expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe annual effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was 527.7%, compared to an annual effective tax rate of 36.2% for fiscal year 2017. Generally, the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes, partially offset by the tax benefit associated with our domestic production activities deduction, research and development tax credits and earnings in jurisdictions subject to tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. The effective tax rate for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018 was higher than the effective rate for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to the enactment of the TCJA during the fiscal year. As a result of the enactment, we recorded a significant tax benefit during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. This benefit has the effect of increasing the tax rate due to losses generated in the twelve months ended March 31, 2018.\n\nContractual Obligations\nAt March 31, 2019, we had the following contractual obligations:\nPayment due by period (Dollars in thousands)\n\nAt March 31, 2019, the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and the accrual for the related interest was $1.4 million. We are unable to make a reliable estimate when cash settlement, if any, will occur with a tax authority as the timing of examinations and ultimate resolution of those examinations is uncertain. We have also excluded long-term deferred revenue of $94.6 million as such amounts will be recognized as services are provided.\n (1) Includes estimated future interest at an interest rate of 4.25% for our outstanding term loan at March 31, 2019. \n (2) Represents estimated open purchase orders to purchase inventory as well as commitments for products and services used in the normal course of business. \n (3) We lease facilities and certain equipment under operating lease agreements extending through September 2030 for a total of $98.3 million.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nCommitment and Contingencies\nWe account for claims and contingencies in accordance with authoritative guidance that requires us to record an estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that it is reasonably possible, but not probable, that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred, or if the amount of a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, then, in accordance with the authoritative guidance, we disclose the amount or range of estimated loss if the amount or range of estimated loss is material. Accounting for claims and contingencies requires us to use our judgment. We consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seek input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business.\nWe have a contingent consideration asset related to the divestiture of our HNT tools business in September 2018. The contingent consideration asset represents potential future earnout payments to us of up to $4.0 million over two years that are contingent on the HNT tools business achieving certain milestones. The fair value of the contingent consideration of $2.3 million was recognized on the acquisition date and was measured using observable (Level 3) inputs. The contingent consideration asset at March 31, 2019 was $0.8 million.\nWe had a contingent liability at", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial information and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Actual events or results may differ materially due to competitive factors and other factors discussed in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report. These factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. See the section titled \"Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\" that appears at the beginning of this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are an industry leader in providing service assurance and security solutions that are used by customers worldwide to assure their digital business services against disruption. Service providers and enterprises, including local, state and federal government agencies, rely on our solutions to achieve the visibility necessary to optimize network performance, ensure the delivery of high-quality, mission-critical applications and services, gain timely insight into the end user experience and protect the network from attack. With our offerings, customers can quickly, efficiently and effectively identify and resolve issues that result in downtime, interruptions to services, poor service quality or compromised security, thereby driving compelling returns on their investments in their network and broader technology initiatives.\nOur operating results are influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the mix and quantity of products and services sold, pricing, costs of materials used in our products, growth in employee-related costs, including commissions, and the expansion of our operations. Factors that affect our ability to maximize our operating results include, but are not limited to, our ability to introduce and enhance existing products, the marketplace acceptance of those new or enhanced products, continued expansion into international markets, development of strategic partnerships, competition, successful acquisition integration efforts, and our ability to achieve expense reductions and make improvements in a highly competitive industry.\nResults Overview\nTotal revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 was primarily impacted by lower spending by customers in the service provider customer segment for both service assurance and DDoS solutions, and the timing of the divestiture of the HNT tools business in mid-September 2018.\nOur gross profit percentage remained flat during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 as compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.\nNet loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 was $73.3 million, as compared with net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 of $79.8 million, resulting in an increase in net loss of $153.1 million. The increase in net loss was primarily due to a $78.9 million decrease in the income tax benefit, a $35.9 million impairment charge of certain intangible assets related to the HNT tools business, a $13.5 million increase in restructuring charges due to the voluntary separation program, a $13.5 million increase in interest expense due to additional amounts drawn down on the credit facility as well as an increase in the average interest rate on the credit facility, and a $9.5 million loss on the divestiture of the HNT tools business during the twelve months ended March 31, 2019. This increase was partially offset by a net $9.0 million decrease in employee-related expenses as a result of a decrease in headcount partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation.\nAt March 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $487.0 million. This represents an increase of $39.2 million over the previous fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to $149.8 million in cash provided by operations during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, partially offset by $50.0 million used to repay long-term debt, $23.4 million used for capital expenditures, $14.5 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock, and $11.9 million used for tax withholdings on restricted stock units.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe supplement the United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures we report in quarterly and annual earnings announcements, investor presentations and other investor communications by reporting the following non-GAAP measures: non-GAAP total revenue, non-GAAP product revenue, non-GAAP service revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings before interest and other expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from operations, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per share (diluted). Non-GAAP revenue (total, product and service) eliminates the GAAP effects of acquisitions by adding back revenue related to deferred revenue revaluation, as well as revenue impacted by the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross profit includes the aforementioned revenue adjustments and also removes expenses related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based compensation, certain expenses relating to acquisitions including depreciation costs, compensation for post-combination services and business development and integration costs and adds back transitional service agreement income. Non-GAAP income from operations includes the aforementioned adjustments and also removes restructuring charges, intangible asset impairment charges, loss on divestiture and costs related to new accounting standard implementation. Non-GAAP EBITDA from operations includes the aforementioned items related to non-GAAP income from operations and also removes non-acquisition-related depreciation expense. Non-GAAP net income includes the foregoing adjustments related to non-GAAP income from operations, net of related income tax effects in addition to the provisional one-time impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) while removing transitional service agreement income and changes in contingent consideration. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share also excludes these expenses as well as the related impact of all these adjustments on the provision for income taxes.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with GAAP, should not be considered an alternative for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP (revenue, gross profit, operating profit, net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share), and may have limitations in that they do not reflect all our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The presentation of non-GAAP information is not meant to be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the reader's overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain financial measures and providing a level of disclosure that helps investors understand how we plan and measure our business. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared with our peer companies and also enables investors to consider our operating results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis during and following the integration period of our acquisitions. Presenting the GAAP measures on their own may not be indicative of our core operating results. Furthermore, management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding present and future business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following table reconciles revenue, gross profit, income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017: Table 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

acquisition accounting items, and share based compensation to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results. We apply significant judgment and create estimates when applying these policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with determining the amounts of product and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.\nWe derive revenues primarily from the sale of network management tools and security solutions for service provider and enterprise customers, which include hardware, software and service offerings. The majority of our product sales consist of hardware products with embedded software that are essential to providing customers the intended functionality of the solutions. We also sell software offerings decoupled from the underlying hardware and software solutions to provide customers with enhanced functionality.\nWe account for revenue once a legally enforceable contract with a customer has been approved by the parties and the related promises to transfer products or services have been identified. A contract is defined to us as an arrangement with commercial substance identifying payment terms, each party's rights and obligations regarding the products or services to be transferred and the amount we deem probable of collection. Customer contracts may include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether the products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as one combined performance obligation may require significant judgment. Revenue is recognized when control of the products or services are transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products and services.\nProduct revenue is typically recognized upon shipment, provided a legally enforceable contract exists, control has passed to the customer, and in the case of software products, when the customer has the rights and ability to access the software, and collection of the related receivable is probable. If any significant obligations to the customer remain post-delivery, typically involving obligations relating to installation and acceptance by the customer, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled. Our service offerings include installation, integration, extended warranty and maintenance services, post-contract customer support, stand-ready software-as-a-service (SAAS) and other professional services including consulting and training. We generally provide software and/or hardware support as part of product sales. Revenue related to the initial bundled software and hardware support is recognized ratably over the support period. In addition, customers can elect to purchase extended support agreements for periods after the initial software/hardware warranty expiration. Support services generally include rights to unspecified upgrades (when and if available), telephone and internet-based support, updates, bug fixes and hardware repair and replacement. Consulting services are recognized upon delivery or completion of performance\ndepending on the terms of the underlying contract. Reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing consulting services are included in services revenue, with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of service revenue. Training services include on-site and classroom training. Training revenues are recognized upon delivery of the training.\nGenerally, our contracts are accounted for individually. However, when contracts are closely interrelated and dependent on each other, it may be necessary to account for two or more contracts as one to reflect the substance of the group of contracts.\nBundled arrangements are concurrent customer purchases of a combination of our product and service offerings that may be delivered at various points in time. We allocate the transaction price among the performance obligations in an amount that depicts the relative standalone selling prices (SSP) of each obligation. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately based on the element's historical pricing. We also consider our overall pricing objectives and practices across different sales channels and geographies, and market conditions. Generally, we have established SSP for a majority of our service elements based on historical standalone sales. In certain instances, we have established SSP for services based upon an estimate of profitability and the underlying cost to fulfill those services. Further, for certain service engagements, we consider quoted prices as part of multi-element arrangements of those engagements as a basis for establishing SSP. SSP has been established for product elements as the average or median selling price the element was recently sold for, whether sold alone or sold as part of a multiple element transaction. We review sales of the product elements on a quarterly basis and update, when appropriate, SSP for such elements to ensure that it reflects recent pricing experience. Our products are distributed through our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels through alliances with resellers and distributors. Revenue arrangements with resellers and distributors are recognized on a sell-in basis; that is, when control of the product transfers to the reseller or distributor. We record consideration given to a reseller or distributor as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded revenue from the reseller or distributor. With limited exceptions, our return policy does not allow product returns for a refund. Returns have been insignificant to date. In addition, we have a history of successfully collecting receivables from our resellers and distributors.\nMarketable Securities\nWe measure the fair value of our marketable securities at the end of each reporting period. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Marketable securities are recorded at fair value and have been classified as Level 1 or 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in accessible active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves.\nValuation of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Acquisition and Divestiture Accounting Items\nWe amortize acquired definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but subject to annual impairment tests; more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would indicate a potential decline in their fair value. We perform the assessment annually during the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if potential impairment indicators arise. We have identified two reporting units: (1) Service Assurance and (2) Security.\nTo test impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired. If based on our qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, quantitative impairment testing is required. However, if we conclude otherwise, quantitative impairment testing is not required. During fiscal year 2019, we performed a quantitative analysis for goodwill. We determined the fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill using established income and market valuation approaches. Goodwill was estimated to be recoverable as of January 31, 2019.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually, or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets below its carrying value. To test impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible is impaired. If based on our qualitative assessment we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived asset is greater than its carrying amount, quantitative impairment testing is not required. We completed our annual impairment test of the indefinite-lived intangible asset at January 31, 2019 using the qualitative Step 0 assessment. No impairment indicators were observed as of January 31, 2019.\nWe completed two acquisitions and one divestiture during the three-year period ended March 31, 2019. The acquisition method of accounting requires an estimate of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired as part of these transactions. In order to estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets, we use a relief from royalty model which requires management to estimate: future revenues expected to be generated by the acquired intangible assets, a royalty rate which a market participant would pay related to the projected revenue stream, a present value factor which approximates a risk adjusted rate of return for a market participant purchasing the assets, and a technology migration curve representing a period of time over which the technology assets or some portion thereof are still being used. We are also required to develop the fair value for customer relationships acquired as part of these transactions which requires that we create estimates for the following items: a projection of future revenues associated with the acquired company's existing customers, a turnover rate for those customers, a margin related to those sales, and a risk adjusted rate of return for a market participant purchasing those relationships.\nWe have a contingent consideration asset related to the divestiture of our handheld network test (HNT) tools business in September 2018. The contingent consideration asset represents potential future earnout payments to us of up to $4.0 million over two years that are contingent on the HNT tools business achieving certain milestones. The fair value of the contingent consideration of $2.3 million was recognized on the acquisition date and was measured using observable (Level 3) inputs. The contingent consideration asset at March 31, 2019 was $0.8 million.\nWe had a contingent liability at March 31, 2018 for $523 thousand related to the acquisition of Efflux Systems, Inc. (Efflux) in July 2017 for which an escrow account was established to cover damages we may have suffered related to any liabilities that we did not agree to assume or as a result of the breach of representations and warranties of the seller as described in the merger agreement. The $523 thousand was paid to the seller in July 2018.\nWe had a contingent liability at March 31, 2018 for $4.9 million related to the acquisition of Simena LLC (Simena) in November 2011, which was based on the ultimate settlement of assets and liabilities acquired as part of the transaction, and the former owners' future period of employment with us. The contingent purchase consideration of $5.0 million was paid to the seller in November 2018.\nWe had $660 thousand of contingent purchase consideration related to the acquisition of Avvasi Incorporated (Avvasi) in August 2016 for which an escrow account was established to cover damages we may have suffered related to any liabilities that we did not agree to assume or as a result of the breach of representations and warranties of the seller as described in the asset purchase agreement. The $660 thousand was paid to the seller in August 2017.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation expense for all share-based payments. Under the fair value recognition provisions, we recognize share-based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.\nWe are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the share-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.\nBased on historical experience, we assumed an annualized forfeiture rate of 0% for awards granted to our directors, an annualized forfeiture rate of approximately 2% for awards granted to our senior executives, and an annualized forfeiture rate of approximately 5% for all remaining employees. We will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended March 31, 2019 and 2018\nRevenue\nProduct revenue consists of sales of our hardware products and licensing of our software products. Service revenue consists of customer support agreements, consulting, training and stand-ready software as a service offerings. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, no direct customer or indirect channel partner accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue.\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>467,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>520,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(53,129\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service\n</td> <td>442,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>466,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,740\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>909,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>986,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(76,869\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct.

The 11%, or $17.7 million, decrease in cost of product revenue compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a $17.8 million decrease in direct material costs due to shifts in product mix and the decrease in product revenue, a $6.4 million decrease in the amortization of intangible assets, a net $6.3 million decrease in employee-related expenses associated with the timing of certain projects partially offset by an increase in variable incentive compensation, and a $0.6 million decrease in shipping costs. These decreases were partially offset by an $11.6 million increase in costs to deliver model calibration products and a $1.8 million increase in capitalized overhead costs. The product gross profit percentage remained flat at 70% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The 10%, or $35.4 million decrease in product gross profit, corresponds with the 10%, or $53.1 million decrease in product revenue, partially offset by the 11%, or $17.7 million decrease in cost of product.\nService. The $0.1 million decrease in cost of service revenue was primarily due to an $8.5 million decrease in contractor fees, a $2.0 million decrease in travel expenses, and a $1.7 million decrease in expenses associated with the timing of certain projects. These decreases were almost entirely offset with a net $12.0 million increase in employee-related expenses associated with the timing of certain projects as well as an increase in variable incentive compensation partially offset by a decrease due to a reduction in headcount as a result of the voluntary separation program. The service gross profit percentage decreased by two percentage points to 74% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. The 7%, or $23.7 million, decrease in service gross profit corresponds with the 5%, or $23.7 million, decrease in service revenue, partially offset by the $0.1 million decrease in cost of services.\nGross profit. Our gross profit decreased 8%, or $59.1 million, compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. This decrease is attributable to the 8%, or $76.9 million, decrease in revenue offset by a $17.8 million, or 7%, decrease in cost of revenue. The gross margin percentage remained flat at 72% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,488\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>291,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>312,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,666\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>93,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,907\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>74,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,335\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>18,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of intangible assets\n</td> <td>35,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on divestiture of business\n</td> <td>9,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>727,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>718,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, fees for outside consultants, overhead and related expenses associated with the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products.\nThe 5%, or $11.5 million, decrease in research and development expenses compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a net $4.5 million decrease in employee-related expense due to lower headcount partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation, a $4.3 million decrease in consulting fees, a $3.4 million decrease from depreciation expense and a $1.0 million decrease in travel expenses. These decreases were partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in expenses associated with the timing of certain projects.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses and commissions, overhead and other expenses associated with selling activities and marketing programs such as trade shows, seminars, advertising, and new product launch activities.\nThe 7%, or $20.7 million, decrease in total sales and marketing expenses compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a net $12.2 million decrease in employee-related expense due to lower headcount partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation, a $3.1 million decrease in trade shows and other events, a $2.4 million decrease in consulting fees, a $1.7 million decrease in travel expenses, a $1.4 million decrease in depreciation expense and a $1.0 million decrease in commissions expense. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.9 million increase in advertising expenses.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses for executive, financial, legal and human resource employees, overhead and other corporate expenditures.\nThe 15%, or $15.9 million, decrease in general and administrative expenses compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a $5.5 million decrease in legal expenses, a $3.6 million decrease in consulting fees, a $2.7 million decrease in tax related items, a $2.0 million decrease in rent and other facilities related expenses and a $1.5 million decrease in business development expenses. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in employee-related expenses primarily due to an increase in variable incentive compensation.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists primarily of amortization of customer relationships, definite-lived trademark and tradenames, and leasehold interest related to the Comms Transaction, ONPATH Technologies, Inc., Simena, Psytechnics, Ltd, Network General Corporation, Avvasi and Efflux.\nThe 3%, or $2.3 million, decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets was largely due to a decrease in amortization of the intangible assets related to the divestiture of the HNT tools business in September 2018.\nImpairment of intangible assets. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we performed a quantitative analysis on certain intangible assets related to the HNT tools business. The fair value of these intangible assets was determined to be less than the carrying value, and as a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $35.9 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.\nRestructuring. During fiscal year 2019 and 2018, we restructured certain departments to better align functions, drive productivity and improve efficiency. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we implemented a voluntary separation program (VSP) for employees who met certain age and service requirements to reduce overall headcount. As a result of the restructuring programs, we recorded $18.7 million and $5.2 million of restructuring charges related to one-time termination benefits as well as facility-related charges during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLoss of Divestiture of Business. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we recorded a $9.5 million loss on the divestiture of the HNT tools business.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net includes interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, interest expense and other non-operating gains or losses.\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other expense, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,332\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,601\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,731\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 46%, or $6.7 million, increase in interest and other expense, net was primarily due to a $13.3 million increase in interest expense due to additional amounts drawn down on the credit facility to fund the ASR as well as an increase in the average interest rate on the credit facility and a $1.6 million increase in other expense due to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration related to the HNT tools business divestiture. These increases were partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in interest income received on investments, a $2.2 million increase in transitional services agreement income related to the HNT tools business divestiture, and a $2.2 million decrease in foreign exchange expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe annual effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 was 21.1%, compared to an annual effective tax rate of 527.7% for fiscal year 2018. Generally, the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes, partially offset by the tax benefit associated with our domestic production activities deduction, research and development tax credits and earnings in jurisdictions subject to tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. The provisions of the TCJA that affect the Company's fiscal year 2019 tax rate include the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), the deduction for Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) and the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) inclusion. The effective tax rate for the twelve months ended March 31, 2019 is lower than the effective rate for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to the enactment of the TCJA during the prior fiscal year. As a result of the enactment, we recorded a significant tax benefit during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. This benefit has the effect of increasing the tax rate due to losses generated in the twelve months ended March 31, 2018.\nThere are several key provisions under the TCJA, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, that impact us. The final impact of the TCJA, as described below, did not differ from the estimates reported at December 31, 2017. The key changes from the TCJA that were reported as of March 31, 2019 are the impact due to the reduced U.S. Federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, a one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings on which U.S. income tax was deferred, additional tax expense under BEAT, a deduction for FDII, an income inclusion under GILTI and the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction.\nWe are required to record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the enacted tax rate which they are expected to reverse in the future. Therefore, any U.S. related deferred taxes were re-measured from 35.0% down to 21.0% based on the recorded balances. As of December 31, 2017, we recorded an estimate related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax balances, which was a benefit of approximately $87 million. During the third quarter of the current fiscal year we finalized our calculation and did not adjust our estimate recorded.\nAdditionally, we are required to calculate a one-time transition tax based on our total post-1986 foreign subsidiaries' earnings and profits that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. As of December 31, 2017, we recorded an estimate related to this one-time transition charge of approximately $2 million. During the third quarter of the current fiscal year we finalized our calculation and did not adjust our estimate recorded.\nWe are subject to the tax on the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). We are required to make an accounting policy election of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period\nexpense when incurred (the \"period cost method\") or (2) factoring such amounts into our measurement of our deferred taxes (the \"deferred method\"). We have elected to treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred (the \"period cost method\").\nAs a result of TCJA we expect that current and future foreign earnings may be repatriated tax efficiently. After fully assessing the impact of the TCJA, we have determined that our current and future foreign earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested where we can repatriate those earnings in a tax efficient manner acceptable to management and which comply with local statutory and operational requirements. Additionally, we intend a one-time repatriation of certain previously taxed historical earnings because of TCJA which can be repatriated in a tax efficient manner.

These decreases were partially offset by a $2.2 million increase from capitalized software costs. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, there were higher costs capitalized for software development.\nSales and marketing. The 5%, or $16.1 million, decrease in total sales and marketing expenses compared to the same period last year was primarily due to an $18.0 million decrease in commissions expense, a $5.8 million decrease in trade shows and other events, and a $1.4 million decrease in compensation for post-combination services. These decreases were partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in employee-related expenses and a $2.6 million increase in depreciation expense.\nGeneral and administrative. The 8%, or $9.0 million, decrease in general and administrative expenses compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a $9.5 million decrease in business development expenses, a $3.0 million decrease in employee-related expenses primarily due to a decrease in variable incentive compensation, a $1.9 million decrease in expenses related to the transitional services agreements related to the Comms Transaction and a $1.4 million decrease in legal expenses. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.8 million increase in consulting fees related to the implementation of new accounting standards, a $1.7 million increase in bad debt expense and a $1.7 million increase in rent expense.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets. The 9%, or $6.5 million, increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets was primarily due to an increase of $3.5 million due to the acceleration of certain intangibles related to the Comms Transaction, with the remaining increase due to changes in percentages of amortization related to the Comms Transaction.\nRestructuring. During fiscal year 2018 and 2017, we restructured certain departments to better align functions, drive productivity and improve efficiency. As a result of the restructuring programs, we recorded $5.2 million and $4.0 million of restructuring charges related to costs to be paid to employees for one-time termination benefits as well as facility-related charges during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other expense, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,601\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,879\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,722\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 48%, or $4.7 million, increase in interest and other expense, net was primarily due to a $3.5 million increase in interest expense due to additional amounts drawn down on the credit facility entered into on January 16, 2018 as well as an increase in the average interest rate and a $1.6 million increase in foreign currency exchange expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe annual effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was 527.7%, compared to an annual effective tax rate of 36.2% for fiscal year 2017. Generally, the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes, partially offset by the tax benefit associated with our domestic production activities deduction, research and development tax credits and earnings in jurisdictions subject to tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. The effective tax rate for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018 was higher than the effective rate for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to the enactment of the TCJA during the fiscal year. As a result of the enactment, we recorded a significant tax benefit during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. This benefit has the effect of increasing the tax rate due to losses generated in the twelve months ended March 31, 2018.\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(98,471\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(117,365\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(621\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nAt March 31, 2019, we had the following contractual obligations:\nPayment due by period (Dollars in thousands)\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1\nyear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>640,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>568,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconditional purchase obligations (2)\n</td> <td>49,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (3)\n</td> <td>98,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension benefit plan\n</td> <td>7,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>794,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>587,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt March 31, 2019, the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and the accrual for the related interest was $1.4 million.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nCommitment and Contingencies\nWe account for claims and contingencies in accordance with authoritative guidance that requires us to record an estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that it is reasonably possible, but not probable, that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred, or if the amount of a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, then, in accordance with the authoritative guidance, we disclose the amount or range of estimated loss if the amount or range of estimated loss is material. Accounting for claims and contingencies requires us to use our judgment. We consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seek input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business.\nWe have a contingent consideration asset related to the divestiture of our HNT tools business in September 2018. The contingent consideration asset represents potential future earnout payments to us of up to $4.0 million over two years that are contingent on the HNT tools business achieving certain milestones. The fair value of the contingent consideration of $2.3 million was recognized on the acquisition date and was measured using observable (Level 3) inputs. The contingent consideration asset at March 31, 2019 was $0.8 million.\nWe had a contingent liability at"}
