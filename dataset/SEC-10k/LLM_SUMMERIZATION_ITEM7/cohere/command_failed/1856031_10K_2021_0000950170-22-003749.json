Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur management's discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as disclosed in our registration statement on Form S-4A, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 23, 2021 (the \"Registration Statement\"). This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the section titled \"Forward-Looking Statements,\" \"Risk Factors\" or in other parts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\nOverview\nWe are an online ticket marketplace that utilizes our technology platform to connect fans of live events seamlessly with ticket sellers. Our mission is to empower and enable fans to Experience It Live. We believe live events deliver some of life's most exciting moments. Our platform provides ticket buyers and sellers with an easy-to-use and trusted marketplace experience that enables fans to purchase tickets to live events and create new memories. We believe we differentiate from competitors by offering extensive breadth and depth of ticket listings at a competitive value. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, our revenues were $443.0 million, $35.1 million, and $468.9 million, respectively, and Marketplace Gross Order Value (\"Marketplace GOV\") was $2,399.1 million, $347.3 million, and $2,279.8 million, respectively. Our net loss was $19.1 million, $774.2 million, and $53.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur Business Model\nWe operate our business in two segments, Marketplace and Resale.\nMarketplace\nThrough our Marketplace segment, we act as an intermediary between ticket buyers and ticket sellers. We earn revenue processing ticket sales from our Owned Properties, consisting of the Vivid Seats website and mobile applications, and from our Private Label offering, which comprises numerous distribution partners. Using our online platform, we process customer payments, coordinate ticket deliveries, and provide customer service to ticket buyers.\nA key component of our platform is Skybox, a proprietary enterprise resource planning tool used by many of our ticket sellers. Skybox is a free-to-use system that helps ticket sellers manage ticket inventories, adjust pricing, and fulfill orders across multiple secondary ticket marketplaces.\nWe primarily earn revenue from service and delivery fees charged to ticket buyers. We also earn referral fee revenue by offering event ticket insurance to ticket buyers, using a third-party insurance provider. We do not hold ticket inventory in the Marketplace segment. We incur costs for developing and maintaining our platform, providing back-office and customer support to ticket buyers and ticket sellers, processing payments, and shipping tickets. We also incur substantial marketing costs, primarily related to online advertising.\nResale\nIn our Resale segment, we acquire tickets to resell on secondary ticketing marketplaces, including our own. Our Resale segment also provides internal research and development support for Skybox and our ongoing efforts to deliver best in class seller software and tools.\nKey Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use the following metrics to evaluate our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe these metrics provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team.\nThe following table summarizes our key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measure for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketplace GOV(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,399,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>347,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,279,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Marketplace orders(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Resale orders(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>303\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(80,204\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Marketplace GOV represents the total transactional amount of Marketplace segment orders placed on our platform in a period, inclusive of fees, exclusive of taxes, and net of event cancellations that occurred during that period. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Marketplace GOV was negatively impacted by event cancellations in the amount of $108.0 million, compared to $216.0 million and $22.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(2)Total Marketplace orders represents the volume of Marketplace segment orders placed on our platform during a period, net of event cancellations that occurred during that period. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our Marketplace segment experienced 257,109 event cancellations, compared to 549,085 and 54,961 event cancellations during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(3)Total Resale orders represents the volume of Resale segment orders in a period, net of event cancellations that occurred during that period. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our Resale segment experienced 6,165 event cancellations, compared to 20,644 and 1,517 event cancellations during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(4)Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined under GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Refer to the Adjusted EBITDA section below for a reconciliation to its most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nMarketplace GOV\nMarketplace GOV is a key driver of our Marketplace segment's revenue. Marketplace GOV represents the total transactional amount of Marketplace orders in a period, inclusive of fees, exclusive of taxes, and net of event cancellations that occurred during that period. Marketplace GOV reflects our ability to attract and retain customers, as well as the overall health of the industry.\nOur Marketplace GOV is impacted by seasonality, and typically sees increased activity in the fourth quarter when all major sports leagues are in season and we experience increases in order volume for theater and concert events during the holiday season. Quarterly fluctuations in our Marketplace GOV result from the number of cancellations, the popularity and demand of performers, tours, teams, and events, and the length and team composition of sports playoff series and championship games.\nOur Marketplace GOV increased during the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of higher sales volume and fewer event cancellations following an overall reduction in mitigation measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTotal Marketplace Orders\nTotal Marketplace orders represents the volume of Marketplace segment orders placed on our platform in a period, net of event cancellations. An order can include one or more tickets and/or parking passes. Total Marketplace orders allow us to monitor order volume and better identify trends within our Marketplace segment. Total Marketplace orders increased during the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of higher sales volume and fewer event cancellations following an overall reduction in mitigation measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTotal Resale Orders\nTotal Resale orders represents the volume of Resale segment orders sold in a period, net of event cancellations. An order can include one or more tickets and/or parking passes. Total Resale orders allow us to monitor order volume and better identify trends within our Resale segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, because it is a measure frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Further, we believe this measure is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results because it excludes the impact of items that are outside the control of management or not reflective of ongoing performance related directly to the operation of our business segments.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key measurement used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to analyzing operating expenses, evaluating performance, and performing strategic planning and annual budgeting. Moreover, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance and highlighting trends in our operating results.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, net loss, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,129\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(774,185\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(53,848\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales tax liability(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Transaction costs(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity-based compensation(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Senior management transition costs(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on extinguishment of debt(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Litigation, settlements and related costs(6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change to annual bonus program(7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Customer loyalty program stand-up costs(8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impairment charges(9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on asset disposals(10)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Severance related to COVID-19(11)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in value of warrants(12)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(80,204\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) We have historically incurred sales tax expense in jurisdictions where we expected to remit sales tax payments but were not yet collecting from customers. During the second half of 2021, we began collecting sales tax from customers in all required states. The sales tax liability presented herein represents the exposure for sales tax prior to the date we began collecting sales tax from customers reduced by abatements received.\n(2) Transaction costs consist of legal; accounting; tax and other professional fees; as well as personnel-related costs, which consist of severance and retention bonuses; and integration costs. Transaction costs recognized in 2021 were related to the Merger Transaction (as defined below), to the extent they were not eligible for capitalization, and the acquisition of Betcha Sports, Inc. (\"Betcha\"). Transaction costs recognized in 2020 were related to the acquisition of Fanxchange Ltd. in 2019. In 2019, we completed the acquisition of Fanxchange Ltd. and attempted to pursue an acquisition that was ultimately abandoned. These acquisition-related costs are not representative of normal, recurring, cash operating expenses.\n(3) We incur equity-based compensation expenses for profits interests issued prior to the Merger Transaction and equity granted according to the 2021 Incentive Award Plan (\"2021 Plan\"), which we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. The 2021 Plan was approved and adopted in order to facilitate the grant of equity incentive awards to our employees and directors. The 2021 Plan became effective on October 18, 2021.\n(4) In 2019, we incurred costs associated with the transition to our current senior management team, including our Chief Executive Officer. These costs include recruiting costs and costs to compensate our Chief Executive Officer for benefits forfeited at his previous employer.\n(5) Losses incurred resulted from the retirement of the May 2020 First Lien Loan and fees paid related to the early payment of a portion of the principal of the June 2017 First Lien Loan in October 2021, the retirement of the revolving credit facility in May 2020, and the repayment of the $40.0 million second lien term loan in 2019.\n(6) These expenses relate to external legal costs and settlement costs, which were unrelated to our core business operations.\n(7) We restructured our employee incentive compensation plan during 2019.\n(8) During August 2019, we initiated the Vivid Seats Rewards customer loyalty program. We incurred $3.2 million of initial stand-up costs related to the commencement of the program. These stand-up costs consist primarily of customer incentives and marketing costs, which are not expected to reoccur.\n(9) We incurred impairment charges triggered by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2020. The impairment charges resulted in a reduction in the carrying values of our goodwill, indefinite-lived trademark, definite-lived intangible assets, and other long-lived assets.\n(10) We incur losses on asset disposals, which are not considered indicative of our core operating performance.\n(11) These charges relate to severance costs resulting from significant reductions in employee headcount due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n(12) These expenses relate to the modification of the terms of the Class A Public Warrants in connection with the Merger Transaction and revaluation of Hoya Intermediate Warrants (defined below) following the Merger Transaction.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nOur operational and financial results have been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of factors that present significant opportunities as well as risks and challenges, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\u201d The key factors discussed below impacted our 2021 results or are anticipated to impact our 2022 results.\nGrowth and retention of customers and sellers\nOur revenue growth primarily depends on acquiring and retaining customers. We seek to have ticket buyers and sellers view us as their destination ticketing marketplace when searching for, purchasing and selling event tickets. We believe we differentiate from competitors by offering extensive breadth and depth of ticket listings at a competitive value, and by providing a reliable and secure experience for ticket buyers. We acquire new ticket buyers through marketing, partnerships, brand advertisement and word-of-mouth. Performance marketing channels are\nhighly competitive, and we must continue to be effective in these acquisition channels. We seek to retain customers by offering an optimal customer experience, providing additional avenues for engagement and outreach such as customized emails, and providing value to our customers such as with our Vivid Seats Rewards program. Likewise, we must preserve our longstanding relationships with ticket sellers to maintain extensive ticket listing options at competitive prices. We recognize the importance of seller and other distribution relationships in the ticketing ecosystem and offer products and services designed to support the needs of our sellers and distribution partners.\nDuring 2021, we experienced a dramatic increase in new orders processed starting in the second quarter alongside the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination programs across the United States and supported by our investments in revamped branding and product enhancements to attract new and reattract prior customers. We also experienced a significant reduction in event cancellations in 2021 as compared to 2020. Our expenses increased on a similar trajectory over the course of the year as we increased our marketing spend and efforts, hired additional personnel, and had additional outsourced customer service provider costs to capitalize on the increase in live event attendance and handle the increased order demand.\nSupply of Concert, Sporting, and Theatre Events\nA reduction in the number of live concert, sporting and theater events will have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income. Many of the factors affecting the number and availability of live concert, sporting and theater events are beyond our control. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our Marketplace segment experienced 257,109 event cancellations and our Resale segment experienced 6,165 event cancellations.\nAttracting and retaining talent\nWe rely on the ability to attract and retain employees. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. As a company, we share the dedication to our mission to Experience It Live. We believe offering employees an engaging and positive work environment contributes to both their success and our success. We are committed to fostering an environment that is inclusive and welcome to diversity in backgrounds, experiences and thoughts as a means toward achieving employee engagement, empowerment, innovation and good decision-making. As of December 31, 2021, we had 430 full-time employees which increased over 80% from 236 full-time employees as of December 31, 2020. We expect our employee count to further increase in 2022.\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a significant negative impact on our business, operational and financial results. While we have seen recovery in the demand for live events with an increase in ticket orders, as well as an increasing number of live events held in 2021 as compared to 2020, we could be adversely affected if new variants emerge and if COVID-19 case counts increase. As of December 31, 2021, most jurisdictions permit full capacity and many events are taking place as planned. Some events, however, continue to be cancelled, rescheduled, or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If economic conditions caused by the pandemic do not continue to recover, including as a result of potential developments with variants of the virus or other market-disrupting events, our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations may be further impacted.\nTicketing Industry Competition\nOur business faces significant competition from other national, regional and local primary and secondary ticketing service providers. We also face competition in the resale of tickets from other professional ticket resellers. We must continue to innovate and offer our buyers, sellers and partners an attractive value proposition.\nSeasonality\nOur operational and financial results can be impacted by seasonality, with increased activity in the fourth quarter when all major sports leagues are in season and we experience an increase in order volume for theater and concert events during the holiday season. In addition to typical seasonality impacts to our business, our quarterly results and quarterly year-over-year growth rates can be impacted by:\n\u2022sports teams performance, the number of playoff games in a series and teams involved;\n\u2022the timing of tours of top grossing acts;\n\u2022tour and game cancellations due to weather, illness or other factors; and\n\u2022popularity and demand for certain performers and events.\nIn 2021, the impacts of COVID-19 resulted in unique impacts to our business beyond normal course seasonality. In particular, we experienced a dramatic increase in new orders processed starting in the second quarter alongside the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination programs across the United States. We expect the continued return of live events as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, subject to potential developments with variants of the virus or other market-disrupting events, to continue to be most impactful in the near term.\nRecent Developments\nThe Business Combination\nOn October 18, 2021, we consummated the Merger Transaction. The Merger Transaction was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with Hoya Intermediate, a subsidiary of Vivid Seats Inc., treated as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of the combined company represent a continuation of the financial statements of Hoya Intermediate. In connection with the Merger Transaction, Vivid Seats also entered into a private investment in public equity financing ( PIPE Subscription\u201d). Pursuant to the PIPE Subscription, Vivid Seats raised an additional $250.2 million. In addition, Hoya Intermediate paid Eldridge Industries, LLC $11.7 million in cash at the closing of the Merger Transaction for a backstop fee.\nProceeds from the Merger Transaction and the PIPE Subscription were used for debt repayment and capital structure optimization. We declared and paid a special dividend of $17.7 million, or $0.23 per share, to holders of Class A Common Stock in 2021.\nBetcha Acquisition\nOn December 13, 2021, we acquired 100% of the equity interests of Betcha. Betcha is a real money daily fantasy sports app with social and gamification features that enhance fans' connection with their favorite live sports. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred consisted of approximately $0.8 million in cash and 2,143,438 shares of Class A common stock. The total consideration includes cash earnouts of $7.5 million as of the acquisition date representing the estimated fair value that we may be obligated to pay if Betcha meets certain earnings objectives following the acquisition. In addition, the purchase consideration includes future milestone payments of $9.7 million as of the acquisition date representing the estimated fair value that we may be obligated to pay upon the achievement of certain integration objectives.\nCOVID-19 Has Had a Disproportionately Negative Effect on the Live Entertainment Industry\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Almost immediately, mitigation measures implemented or recommended by governmental authorities and private organizations restricted attendance at live events throughout North America producing large-scale event cancellations and meaningfully reduced purchases made on our platform. The resulting decline in revenue and broader economic impact of the pandemic led us to determine that an impairment triggering event existed during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, resulting in an impairment charge of $573.8 million to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, definite-lived intangible assets, and other long-lived assets. These factors contributed to a net loss of $774.2 million in 2020.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2021, and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2021, we have seen a recovery in ticket orders as mitigation measures ease. For the second half of 2021, our annualized order volume exceeded 2019 levels. While we continued to recognize a net loss in 2021, we realized significant year-over-year increases in revenues and operating income. Our operating income was $76.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is evolving and the ultimate pace and timing of recovery continues to remain uncertain. If economic conditions caused by the pandemic were to worsen, our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations may be further materially impacted.\nResults of Operations\nDiscussions of the year ended December 31, 2019 and comparison between the year ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019 can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Vivid Seats\u201d in our Registration Statement.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>443,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>407,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1163\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>267\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketing and selling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45,925\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(573,838\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(716,018\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>792,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense -

The increase, which occurred in both our Marketplace and Resale segments, resulted from an increase in new orders processed resulting from the resumption of live events and a reduction in event cancellations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic and resulting mitigation measures had a significant adverse effect on order volume and event cancellations during 2020. By the third quarter of 2021, most local governments had lifted large scale restrictions on live events. For the second half of 2021, our annualized order volume exceeded 2019 levels.\nMarketplace\nThe following table presents revenues in our Marketplace segment by event category (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Concerts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>985\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sports\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,936\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Theater\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,011\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>395\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Marketplace revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>366,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,574\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarketplace revenues increased $366.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Marketplace revenues resulted primarily from an overall increase in new orders processed on our Marketplace platform combined with fewer event cancellation charges.\nTotal Marketplace orders increased 5.6 million, or 523%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in orders resulted from the increase in events held after restrictions on fan attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic were reduced or lifted. These increases occurred across all event categories with the greatest increase in sports.\nCancellation charges, which are recognized as a reduction to revenues, were $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $76.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to the mass cancellations of live events during the initial phases of the pandemic in 2020, cancellation charges were higher in 2020 compared to 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized an increase in revenue of $5.1 million and a decrease of $15.3 million, respectively, due to the impact of cancellation charges for cancelled events where the performance obligations were satisfied in prior periods.\nMarketplace revenues by business model consisted of the following (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Owned Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>308,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>284,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,174\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Private Label\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(907\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,079\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Marketplace revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>366,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,574\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increases in revenue from both Owned Properties and Private Label during the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted primarily from the increase in order volume resulting from the loosening of restrictions on live events and fewer event cancellations than the year ended December 31, 2020.\nResale\nRevenue for our Resale segment increased $41.6 million, or 352%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase resulted primarily from higher order volume. Total Resale orders increased 0.1 million, or 305%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Cancellation charges, classified as a reduction of revenue, negatively impacted Resale revenue by $2.8 million and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCost of Revenues (exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization)\nThe following table presents cost of revenues by segment (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketplace\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>276\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Resale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>267\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal cost of revenues increased $65.9 million, or 267%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

The increase in cost of revenues is consistent with the increase in total Marketplace orders, which increased by 5.6 million orders, or 523%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nResale\nResale cost of revenues increased $28.0 million, or 255%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase resulted from an increase in total Resale orders of 0.1 million orders, or 305%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Resale cost of revenues is not consistent with the increase in Resale revenues due to higher ticket prices and margins in 2021 compared to 2020.

Our spending on online advertising increased by $126.2 million, or 369%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. As restrictions on the attendance of live events were reduced or lifted, we increased our spending on marketing to capitalize on the increase in live event attendance.

Other general and administrative expenses increased $13.2 million, or 61%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $9.5 million increase in consulting and professional service fees related to the Merger Transaction, a $3.8 million increase in legal fees, and a $0.5 million increase in legal settlement expenses. Additionally, there was a $3.5 million increase in other general and administrative expenses, primarily related to an increase in licensed software costs and rent expenses. This was offset by a $4.1 million decrease in other expenses, primarily related to a decrease in charitable contributions as a result of the reduction in event cancellations in 2021 compared to 2020.\nPersonnel expenses increased $9.9 million, or 26%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to higher employee headcount and an increase in costs for our outsourced customer service provider primarily due to the increase in order volume. This was partially offset by government payroll subsidies for U.S. and Canadian employers.\nNon-income tax expenses increased $3.0 million, or 42%, of which $2.2 million was related to sales tax expense, and the remainder related to non-income based taxes. This increase primarily resulted from higher order volume.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses decreased $45.9 million, or 95%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the impairment of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nImpairment Charges\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we incurred impairment charges of $573.8 million. These impairment charges were triggered by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the effects of the pandemic, we experienced a substantial reduction of revenue during the first half of 2020, which continued through the remainder of the year and into the first half of 2021. We have not incurred any impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOther Expenses\nThe following table presents other expenses (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense - net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,130\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense - net\nInterest expense increased $0.7 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Although we paid off the May 2020 First Lien Loan and made a partial payment of the outstanding principal on the June 2017 First Lien Loan on October 18, 2021, interest expense was similar to the prior year due to the timing of when we entered into the May 2020 First Lien Loan and made the debt repayments in 2021. In addition, the interest rate cap and interest rate swaps matured during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt increased $35.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to our full repayment of the May 2020 First Lien Loan and a partial repayment of the outstanding principal on the June 2017 First Lien Loan. The loss includes $28.0 million for a prepayment penalty and $6.1 million for the amortization of the remaining balance of the original issuance discount and issuance costs related to the repayment of the May 2020 First Lien Loan in full, as well as $1.7 million for the amortization of the balance of the original issuance discount and issuance costs related to the partial repayment of the outstanding principal on the June 2017 First Lien Loan.\nOther expenses\nOther expenses were $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to our modification of the terms of Class A Public Warrants in connection with the Merger Transaction. There were no other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have historically financed our operations primarily through cash generated from our operating activities. Our primary short-term requirements for liquidity and capital are to fund general working capital, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements. Our primary long-term liquidity needs are related to debt repayment and potential acquisitions.\nOur primary sources of funds are cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings, including our term loans. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we borrowed $50.0 million under our revolving credit facility in March 2020 and subsequently entered into the May 2020 First Lien Loan (defined below). We received $251.5 million in net cash proceeds from the May 2020 First Lien Loan, which we used to repay the $50.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility in May 2020 and to fund our operations. As noted in the Liquidity and Capital Resources-Loan Agreements\u201d section below, we repaid the May 2020 First Lien Loan in connection with, and using the proceeds from, the Merger Transaction and the PIPE Subscription. Our existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for the next 12 months.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $489.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of interest-bearing deposit accounts, money market accounts managed by financial institutions, and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we have generated positive cash flows from our operating activities. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, we repaid $190.7 million of outstanding June 2017 First Lien Loan and added a new revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million.\nLoan Agreements\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we borrowed $50.0 million under the Revolving Facility in March 2020. We then entered into the May 2020 First Lien Loan, which resulted in $251.5 million in net cash proceeds. We used the net cash proceeds from the May 2020 First Lien Loan to immediately repay the $50.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility and to fund our operations. The Revolving Facility was terminated in full simultaneously with the repayment in May 2020.\nThe May 2020 First Lien Loan, which is pari passu with the June 2017 First Lien Loan, carries a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 9.50%, or a base rate plus an applicable margin of 8.50%. The May 2020 First Lien Loan matures in May 2026, subject to an earlier springing maturity date of June 30, 2024 if the June 2017 First Lien Loan, or a refinancing thereof with scheduled payments of principal prior to June 30, 2024, remains outstanding as of that date. The effective interest rate on the May 2020 First Lien Loan, which fluctuates based on certain paid-in-kind elections, was 11.50% per annum as of December 31, 2020. We made no payments during 2020 on the May 2020 First Lien Term Loan. Interest incurred under the May 2020 First Lien Loan was capitalized into the principal quarterly in August and November 2020, resulting in an outstanding principal of $275.7 million as of December 31, 2020. Additional interest was capitalized into the principal in the first nine months of 2021, resulting in an outstanding principal of $304.1 million as of September 30, 2021. On October 18, 2021, we repaid this loan in full in connection with, and using the proceeds from, the Merger Transaction and the PIPE Subscription and incurred a $28.0 million prepayment penalty.\nWe have an outstanding loan balance of $465.7 million under the June 2017 First Lien Loan as of December 31, 2021, which matures on June 30, 2024. Under the June 2017 First Lien Loan, we make quarterly principal payments of $1.6 million, reduced by certain prepayments. Principal payments amounted to $4.8 million and $5.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effective interest rate on the June 2017 First Lien Loan, which fluctuates based on market interest rates, was 4.5% per annum as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. In 2021, in addition to the required quarterly principal payments, we paid $148.2 million of the outstanding loan balance in\nconnection with, and using the proceeds from, the Merger Transaction and the PIPE Subscription. We made no payments under the June 2017 First Lien Loan during 2020, aside from the required quarterly principal payments.\nUpon closing of the Merger Transaction and receipt of cash proceeds under the PIPE Subscription on October 18, 2021, we significantly reduced loan amounts outstanding. As of December 31, 2021, we are only party to one credit facility, the June 2017 First Lien Loan.\nOn February 3, 2022, we repaid $190.7 million of outstanding June 2017 First Lien Loan. We entered into an amendment which refinances the remaining existing term loan with a new $275.0 million term loan with a maturity date of February 3, 2029, adds a new revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million with a maturity date of February 3, 2027, replaces the LIBOR based floating interest rate with a term SOFR based floating interest rate and revises the springing financial covenant to require compliance with a first lien net leverage ratio.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nIn connection with the Merger Transaction as described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Vivid Seats Inc. entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with the existing Hoya Intermediate shareholders that will provide for payment to Hoya Intermediate shareholders of 85% of the amount of the tax savings, if any, that we realize (or, under certain circumstances, is deemed to realize) as a result of, or attributable to, (i) increases in the tax basis of assets owned directly or indirectly by Hoya Intermediate or its subsidiaries from, among other things, any redemptions or exchanges of Hoya Intermediate common units (ii) existing tax basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions arising from such tax basis) in long-lived assets owned directly or indirectly by Hoya Intermediate and its subsidiaries, and (iii) certain other tax benefits (including deductions in respect of imputed interest) related to Hoya Intermediate making payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(33,892\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,345\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,605\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40,155\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,113\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>245,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55,462\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>204,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>204,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,139\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $219.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to $19.1 million in net loss, non-cash charges of $75.3 million, and net cash inflows from a $163.8 million change in net operating assets. The net cash inflows from the change in our net operating assets were primarily due to a $128.2 million increase in accounts payable, $19.2 million increase in deferred revenue, and a $14.2 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $7.6 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $4.3 million increase in inventory. Each of these resulted from higher order volume and lower event cancellations in 2021.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to $774.2 million in net loss, non-cash charges of $646.8 million, and net cash outflows from a $93.5 million change in net operating assets. The net cash outflows from the change in net operating assets were primarily due to an increase of $195.4 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $67.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $28.7 million decrease in accounts payable. These changes primarily resulted from lower order volume and higher cancellation rates in 2020.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $76.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to $53.8 million in net loss, non-cash charges of $104.5 million, and net cash outflows from a $25.8 million change in net operating assets. The net cash outflows from the change in net operating assets were primarily due to a $23.3 million\nincrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities resulting from an increase in accrued taxes and other expenses.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 which primarily included $8.4 million in capital spending on development activities related to our platform.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily included $7.3 million in capital spending on development activities related to our platform.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $40.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which primarily included $31.1 million in acquisition related costs and $7.9 million in capital spending on development activities related to our platform.\nCash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This was due to capital contributions of $752.9 million, offset by $485.1 million in debt payments and debt extinguishment costs, $236.0 million of preferred equity redemptions, $20.1 million of Merger Transaction costs, and $17.7 million of dividends paid.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $245.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which resulted primarily from $260.0 million in proceeds from our May 2020 First Lien Loan. This was partially offset by $6.5 million arranger fee on the May 2020 First Lien Loan, $5.9 million in principal payments on our June 2017 First Lien Loan, and $2.1 million in other debt-related costs. We also borrowed $50.0 million under our Revolving Facility, which we subsequently repaid in 2020.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $55.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We paid $40.0 million to extinguish our June 2017 Second Lien Loan. We made $8.1 million in tax distributions to noncontrolling interest holders and $7.0 million in payments related to our June 2017 First Lien Loan.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). Preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition; equity-based compensation, warrants and earnouts, and impairment of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, definite-lived intangible assets, and long-lived assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, these are the policies that are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our Consolidated Balance Sheets, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from our Marketplace segment primarily consists of service and delivery fees from ticketing operations, reduced by incentives provided to ticket buyers. We also recognize revenue for referral fees earned on the purchase of ticket insurance by ticket buyers from third-party insurers. We recognize revenue from our Marketplace segment when the ticket seller confirms an order with the ticket buyer, at which point the seller is obligated to deliver the\ntickets to the ticket buyer in accordance with the original marketplace listing. Revenue from Marketplace transactions is recognized on a net basis because we act as an agent for these transactions.\nWe estimate and reserve for future cancellation charges based on historical trends, with the corresponding charge reducing revenue. This reserve, known as accrued future customer compensation, is classified within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, with a corresponding asset for expected recoveries from ticket sellers recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSpecific judgments and assumptions considered when estimating future cancellation charges include historical cancellation charges as a percentage of sales, the average length of time to realize such charges, and the potential exposure based on the volume of recent sales activity. Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, estimates for future cancellation charges resulting from event cancellations have been determined based on historical event cancellation rates since the start of the pandemic and management's estimates of future event cancellation trends in the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSuch estimates are inherently uncertain as we are unable to predict the rate at which actual cancellation charges will occur. To the extent that actual cancellation charges are materially different than previously estimated amounts, or changes in recent trends require updates to previously reserved amounts, revenue may be materially impacted. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, cancellation charge reserves increased materially in 2020 due to the large volume of cancellations that occurred from the pandemic. In 2021, reserves reduced due to reductions in estimated future cancellation rates. Should actual cancellation charges exceed previous estimates by a significant amount in a given period, we may experience negative overall revenue.\nWhen an event is cancelled, ticket buyers may receive either a cash refund or credit for future purchases in our marketplace. Credits issued to buyers for cancellations are recorded as accrued customer compensation within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. When a credit is redeemed, revenue is recognized for the newly placed order. Breakage income from customer credits that are not expected to be used is estimated and recognized as revenue in proportion to the pattern of redemption for the customer credits that are used. We estimate breakage based on historical usage trends for credit issued by us and available data on comparable programs. Our estimates of breakage are constrained by our limited history of customer credits.\nWe also offer our customers the opportunity to participate in our loyalty program, Vivid Seats Rewards, through our Marketplace segment, which allows customers to earn and redeem credits on Owned Properties transactions. We defer revenue associated with these credits, which is recorded as Deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred amount is based on expected future usage and is recognized as revenue when the credits are redeemed. To the extent that actual usage differs from expected usage, or that recent trends require a change in the estimated usage rate of unexpired credits, our revenue will be impacted by the change.\nRevenue from our Resale business primarily consists of sales of tickets to customers through online secondary ticket marketplaces. We recognize Resale revenue on a gross basis because we act as a principal in these transactions. We recognize Resale revenue when an order is confirmed.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe account for Restricted Stock Units (\"RSUs\"), stock options, and profits interest at fair value as of the grant date. The restricted stock units vest on a quarterly basis over a four-year period for non-directors and on an annual basis over a five-year period for directors. The stock options vest on a quarterly basis over a four-year period and expire ten years from the date of the grant. Both are subject to the recipient's continued employment through the applicable vesting date. The fair value of stock options granted to certain employees is estimated on the grant date using the Hull-White model, a lattice model which assumes holders will exercise when they achieve certain return thresholds. The model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation, including the sub-optimal exercise factor ( SOEF\u201d), the volatility of our common stock, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. We estimate the fair value of profits interest using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which includes assumptions related to volatility, expected term, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. Expense related\nto grants of equity-based awards is recognized as equity-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, Definite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess goodwill and our indefinite-lived intangible asset (our trademark) for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. We assess definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets (collectively, long-lived assets\u201d) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.\nWe identified the COVID-19 pandemic as a potential triggering event for impairment of our goodwill, indefinite-lived trademark, and long-lived assets. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we evaluated the qualitative assessment by reviewing factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, entity-specific financial performance and other events, including changes in our management. Our annual assessment resulted in no impairment triggers after qualitative assessment for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the second quarter of 2020, we identified the COVID-19 pandemic as a triggering event for our long-lived assets, goodwill, indefinite-lived trademark, and definite-lived intangible assets and our quantitative assessment resulted in impairment charges of $573.8 million.\nDue to global social distancing efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus, in addition to compliance with restrictions enacted by various governmental entities, most live events during 2020 were either postponed or cancelled. Beginning in the second quarter of 2021, there was an increase in new orders processed resulting from the resumption of live events and a reduction in event cancellations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic and resulting mitigation measures had a significant adverse effect on order volume and event cancellations during 2020.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Asset (Trademark)\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Our goodwill and our indefinite-lived trademark are held by our Marketplace segment, which contains one reporting unit.\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization and is reviewed for impairment annually, or earlier whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, with an impairment charge recognized for the difference.\nWhen reviewing goodwill for impairment, we begin by performing a qualitative assessment, which includes, but is not limited to, reviewing factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, entity-specific financial performance and other events, including changes in our management. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then perform a quantitative assessment. Depending upon the results of that assessment, the recorded goodwill may be written down, and impairment expense is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit.\nOur goodwill balance is not currently at risk for additional impairment, as the fair value of our Marketplace reporting unit significantly exceeds its carrying value. For the year ended December 31, 2021, as part of our annual assessment, a qualitative goodwill assessment was performed and we determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying value.\nIn developing fair values for our reporting unit during the second quarter of 2020, we use a discounted cash flow valuation approach, supplemented with a market multiple valuation approach. Significant estimates used in the discounted cash flow models include (i) risk-adjusted discount rates, (ii) forecasted revenue and operating expenses, (iii) forecasted capital expenditures and working capital needs, and (iv) long-term growth rates. These estimates are uncertain as actual discount rates, revenue, operating expenses, capital expenditures, working capital needs, and long-term growth rates may be different than those we have forecasted. These estimates considered the\ndeterioration in financial performance of our Marketplace reporting unit, as well as the anticipated rate of recovery, and implied risk premiums based on the market prices of our equity and debt as of the assessment date. We ultimately determined that the carrying value of our Marketplace reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $377.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSimilar to goodwill, our indefinite-lived trademark is not amortized, but reviewed for impairment annually, or earlier whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For the year ended December 31, 2021, as part of our annual assessment, a qualitative assessment was performed resulting in no impairment. The qualitative assessment included the history and longevity of our brand, our reputation, market share, and importance of our brand in buying decisions.\nIn conjunction with the goodwill impairment event triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, we also assessed our indefinite-lived trademark for impairment during the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting in an impairment charge of $78.7 million. We estimated the fair value of our indefinite-lived trademark based on forecasted revenues and a reasonable royalty rate using the relief from royalty valuation method. We utilized a 2% royalty rate, consistent with the rate used in the initial valuation of the trademark.\nEach reporting period, we perform an evaluation of the remaining useful life of our indefinite-lived trademark to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite life. We consider the life of our indefinite-lived trademark to be appropriate for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nLong-lived assets\nWe also periodically review the carrying amount of our long-lived assets to determine whether current events or business circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We classify our long-lived assets as a single asset group, which consists primarily of definite-lived intangible assets, property and equipment, and personal seat licenses. Our definite-lived intangible assets consist of developed technology, customer and supplier relationships, and non-compete agreements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, management did not identify any events or changes in circumstances which would indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. As such, there were no long-lived asset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our long-lived assets were assessed for impairment during the year ended December 31, 2020, which resulted in an impairment charge of $118.0 million. Significant judgment and estimates were required in assessing impairment of our long-lived assets, including identifying whether events or changes in circumstances require an impairment assessment, and estimating future cash flows and determining appropriate discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. The resulting impairment charge resulted in a complete write-off of our definite-lived intangible assets, property and equipment, and personal seat licenses during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act allows emerging growth companies to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Under Section 107, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. Any decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. We have elected to use the extended transition period under the JOBS Act.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am unable to identify the text you would like me

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur management's discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as disclosed in our registration statement on Form S-4A, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 23, 2021 (the \"Registration Statement\"). This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the section titled \"Forward-Looking Statements,\" \"Risk Factors\" or in other parts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\nOverview\nWe are an online ticket marketplace that utilizes our technology platform to connect fans of live events seamlessly with ticket sellers. Our mission is to empower and enable fans to Experience It Live. We believe live events deliver some of life's most exciting moments. Our platform provides ticket buyers and sellers with an easy-to-use and trusted marketplace experience that enables fans to purchase tickets to live events and create new memories. We believe we differentiate from competitors by offering extensive breadth and depth of ticket listings at a competitive value. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, our revenues were $443.0 million, $35.1 million, and $468.9 million, respectively, and Marketplace Gross Order Value (\"Marketplace GOV\") was $2,399.1 million, $347.3 million, and $2,279.8 million, respectively. Our net loss was $19.1 million, $774.2 million, and $53.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur Business Model\nWe operate our business in two segments, Marketplace and Resale.\nMarketplace\nThrough our Marketplace segment, we act as an intermediary between ticket buyers and ticket sellers. We earn revenue processing ticket sales from our Owned Properties, consisting of the Vivid Seats website and mobile applications, and from our Private Label offering, which comprises numerous distribution partners. Using our online platform, we process customer payments, coordinate ticket deliveries, and provide customer service to ticket buyers.\nA key component of our platform is Skybox, a proprietary enterprise resource planning tool used by many of our ticket sellers. Skybox is a free-to-use system that helps ticket sellers manage ticket inventories, adjust pricing, and fulfill orders across multiple secondary ticket marketplaces.\nWe primarily earn revenue from service and delivery fees charged to ticket buyers. We also earn referral fee revenue by offering event ticket insurance to ticket buyers, using a third-party insurance provider. We do not hold ticket inventory in the Marketplace segment. We incur costs for developing and maintaining our platform, providing back-office and customer support to ticket buyers and ticket sellers, processing payments, and shipping tickets. We also incur substantial marketing costs, primarily related to online advertising.\nResale\nIn our Resale segment, we acquire tickets to resell on secondary ticketing marketplaces, including our own. Our Resale segment also provides internal research and development support for Skybox and our ongoing efforts to deliver best in class seller software and tools.\nKey Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use the following metrics to evaluate our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe these metrics provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team.\nThe following table summarizes our key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measure for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n(1)Marketplace GOV represents the total transactional amount of Marketplace segment orders placed on our platform in a period, inclusive of fees, exclusive of taxes, and net of event cancellations that occurred during that period. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Marketplace GOV was negatively impacted by event cancellations in the amount of $108.0 million, compared to $216.0 million and $22.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(2)Total Marketplace orders represents the volume of Marketplace segment orders placed on our platform during a period, net of event cancellations that occurred during that period. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our Marketplace segment experienced 257,109 event cancellations, compared to 549,085 and 54,961 event cancellations during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(3)Total Resale orders represents the volume of Resale segment orders in a period, net of event cancellations that occurred during that period. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our Resale segment experienced 6,165 event cancellations, compared to 20,644 and 1,517 event cancellations during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(4)Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined under GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Refer to the Adjusted EBITDA section below for a reconciliation to its most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nMarketplace GOV\nMarketplace GOV is a key driver of our Marketplace segment's revenue. Marketplace GOV represents the total transactional amount of Marketplace orders in a period, inclusive of fees, exclusive of taxes, and net of event cancellations that occurred during that period. Marketplace GOV reflects our ability to attract and retain customers, as well as the overall health of the industry.\nOur Marketplace GOV is impacted by seasonality, and typically sees increased activity in the fourth quarter when all major sports leagues are in season and we experience increases in order volume for theater and concert events during the holiday season. Quarterly fluctuations in our Marketplace GOV result from the number of cancellations, the popularity and demand of performers, tours, teams, and events, and the length and team composition of sports playoff series and championship games.\nOur Marketplace GOV increased during the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of higher sales volume and fewer event cancellations following an overall reduction in mitigation measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTotal Marketplace Orders\nTotal Marketplace orders represents the volume of Marketplace segment orders placed on our platform in a period, net of event cancellations. An order can include one or more tickets and/or parking passes. Total Marketplace orders allow us to monitor order volume and better identify trends within our Marketplace segment. Total Marketplace orders increased during the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of higher sales volume and fewer event cancellations following an overall reduction in mitigation measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTotal Resale Orders\nTotal Resale orders represents the volume of Resale segment orders sold in a period, net of event cancellations. An order can include one or more tickets and/or parking passes. Total Resale orders allow us to monitor order volume and better identify trends within our Resale segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, because it is a measure frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Further, we believe this measure is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results because it excludes the impact of items that are outside the control of management or not reflective of ongoing performance related directly to the operation of our business segments.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key measurement used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to analyzing operating expenses, evaluating performance, and performing strategic planning and annual budgeting. Moreover, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance and highlighting trends in our operating results.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, net loss, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in thousands):\n\n(1) We have historically incurred sales tax expense in jurisdictions where we expected to remit sales tax payments but were not yet collecting from customers. During the second half of 2021, we began collecting sales tax from customers in all required states. The sales tax liability presented herein represents the exposure for sales tax prior to the date we began collecting sales tax from customers reduced by abatements received.\n(2) Transaction costs consist of legal; accounting; tax and other professional fees; as well as personnel-related costs, which consist of severance and retention bonuses; and integration costs. Transaction costs recognized in 2021 were related to the Merger Transaction (as defined below), to the extent they were not eligible for capitalization, and the acquisition of Betcha Sports, Inc. (\"Betcha\"). Transaction costs recognized in 2020 were related to the acquisition of Fanxchange Ltd. in 2019. In 2019, we completed the acquisition of Fanxchange Ltd. and attempted to pursue an acquisition that was ultimately abandoned. These acquisition-related costs are not representative of normal, recurring, cash operating expenses.\n(3) We incur equity-based compensation expenses for profits interests issued prior to the Merger Transaction and equity granted according to the 2021 Incentive Award Plan (\"2021 Plan\"), which we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. The 2021 Plan was approved and adopted in order to facilitate the grant of equity incentive awards to our employees and directors. The 2021 Plan became effective on October 18, 2021.\n(4) In 2019, we incurred costs associated with the transition to our current senior management team, including our Chief Executive Officer. These costs include recruiting costs and costs to compensate our Chief Executive Officer for benefits forfeited at his previous employer.\n(5) Losses incurred resulted from the retirement of the May 2020 First Lien Loan and fees paid related to the early payment of a portion of the principal of the June 2017 First Lien Loan in October 2021, the retirement of the revolving credit facility in May 2020, and the repayment of the $40.0 million second lien term loan in 2019.\n(6) These expenses relate to external legal costs and settlement costs, which were unrelated to our core business operations.\n(7) We restructured our employee incentive compensation plan during 2019.\n(8) During August 2019, we initiated the Vivid Seats Rewards customer loyalty program. We incurred $3.2 million of initial stand-up costs related to the commencement of the program. These stand-up costs consist primarily of customer incentives and marketing costs, which are not expected to reoccur.\n(9) We incurred impairment charges triggered by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2020. The impairment charges resulted in a reduction in the carrying values of our goodwill, indefinite-lived trademark, definite-lived intangible assets, and other long-lived assets.\n(10) We incur losses on asset disposals, which are not considered indicative of our core operating performance.\n(11) These charges relate to severance costs resulting from significant reductions in employee headcount due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n(12) These expenses relate to the modification of the terms of the Class A Public Warrants in connection with the Merger Transaction and revaluation of Hoya Intermediate Warrants (defined below) following the Merger Transaction.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nOur operational and financial results have been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of factors that present significant opportunities as well as risks and challenges, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\u201d The key factors discussed below impacted our 2021 results or are anticipated to impact our 2022 results.\nGrowth and retention of customers and sellers\nOur revenue growth primarily depends on acquiring and retaining customers. We seek to have ticket buyers and sellers view us as their destination ticketing marketplace when searching for, purchasing and selling event tickets. We believe we differentiate from competitors by offering extensive breadth and depth of ticket listings at a competitive value, and by providing a reliable and secure experience for ticket buyers. We acquire new ticket buyers through marketing, partnerships, brand advertisement and word-of-mouth. Performance marketing channels are\nhighly competitive, and we must continue to be effective in these acquisition channels. We seek to retain customers by offering an optimal customer experience, providing additional avenues for engagement and outreach such as customized emails, and providing value to our customers such as with our Vivid Seats Rewards program. Likewise, we must preserve our longstanding relationships with ticket sellers to maintain extensive ticket listing options at competitive prices. We recognize the importance of seller and other distribution relationships in the ticketing ecosystem and offer products and services designed to support the needs of our sellers and distribution partners.\nDuring 2021, we experienced a dramatic increase in new orders processed starting in the second quarter alongside the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination programs across the United States and supported by our investments in revamped branding and product enhancements to attract new and reattract prior customers. We also experienced a significant reduction in event cancellations in 2021 as compared to 2020. Our expenses increased on a similar trajectory over the course of the year as we increased our marketing spend and efforts, hired additional personnel, and had additional outsourced customer service provider costs to capitalize on the increase in live event attendance and handle the increased order demand.\nSupply of Concert, Sporting, and Theatre Events\nA reduction in the number of live concert, sporting and theater events will have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income. Many of the factors affecting the number and availability of live concert, sporting and theater events are beyond our control. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our Marketplace segment experienced 257,109 event cancellations and our Resale segment experienced 6,165 event cancellations.\nAttracting and retaining talent\nWe rely on the ability to attract and retain employees. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. As a company, we share the dedication to our mission to Experience It Live. We believe offering employees an engaging and positive work environment contributes to both their success and our success. We are committed to fostering an environment that is inclusive and welcome to diversity in backgrounds, experiences and thoughts as a means toward achieving employee engagement, empowerment, innovation and good decision-making. As of December 31, 2021, we had 430 full-time employees which increased over 80% from 236 full-time employees as of December 31, 2020. We expect our employee count to further increase in 2022.\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a significant negative impact on our business, operational and financial results. While we have seen recovery in the demand for live events with an increase in ticket orders, as well as an increasing number of live events held in 2021 as compared to 2020, we could be adversely affected if new variants emerge and if COVID-19 case counts increase. As of December 31, 2021, most jurisdictions permit full capacity and many events are taking place as planned. Some events, however, continue to be cancelled, rescheduled, or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If economic conditions caused by the pandemic do not continue to recover, including as a result of potential developments with variants of the virus or other market-disrupting events, our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations may be further impacted.\nTicketing Industry Competition\nOur business faces significant competition from other national, regional and local primary and secondary ticketing service providers. We also face competition in the resale of tickets from other professional ticket resellers. We must continue to innovate and offer our buyers, sellers and partners an attractive value proposition.\nSeasonality\nOur operational and financial results can be impacted by seasonality, with increased activity in the fourth quarter when all major sports leagues are in season and we experience an increase in order volume for theater and concert events during the holiday season. In addition to typical seasonality impacts to our business, our quarterly results and quarterly year-over-year growth rates can be impacted by:\n\u2022sports teams performance, the number of playoff games in a series and teams involved;\n\u2022the timing of tours of top grossing acts;\n\u2022tour and game cancellations due to weather, illness or other factors; and\n\u2022popularity and demand for certain performers and events.\nIn 2021, the impacts of COVID-19 resulted in unique impacts to our business beyond normal course seasonality. In particular, we experienced a dramatic increase in new orders processed starting in the second quarter alongside the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination programs across the United States. We expect the continued return of live events as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, subject to potential developments with variants of the virus or other market-disrupting events, to continue to be most impactful in the near term.\nRecent Developments\nThe Business Combination\nOn October 18, 2021, we consummated the Merger Transaction. The Merger Transaction was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with Hoya Intermediate, a subsidiary of Vivid Seats Inc., treated as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of the combined company represent a continuation of the financial statements of Hoya Intermediate. In connection with the Merger Transaction, Vivid Seats also entered into a private investment in public equity financing ( PIPE Subscription\u201d). Pursuant to the PIPE Subscription, Vivid Seats raised an additional $250.2 million. In addition, Hoya Intermediate paid Eldridge Industries, LLC $11.7 million in cash at the closing of the Merger Transaction for a backstop fee.\nProceeds from the Merger Transaction and the PIPE Subscription were used for debt repayment and capital structure optimization. We declared and paid a special dividend of $17.7 million, or $0.23 per share, to holders of Class A Common Stock in 2021.\nBetcha Acquisition\nOn December 13, 2021, we acquired 100% of the equity interests of Betcha. Betcha is a real money daily fantasy sports app with social and gamification features that enhance fans' connection with their favorite live sports. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred consisted of approximately $0.8 million in cash and 2,143,438 shares of Class A common stock. The total consideration includes cash earnouts of $7.5 million as of the acquisition date representing the estimated fair value that we may be obligated to pay if Betcha meets certain earnings objectives following the acquisition. In addition, the purchase consideration includes future milestone payments of $9.7 million as of the acquisition date representing the estimated fair value that we may be obligated to pay upon the achievement of certain integration objectives.\nCOVID-19 Has Had a Disproportionately Negative Effect on the Live Entertainment Industry\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Almost immediately, mitigation measures implemented or recommended by governmental authorities and private organizations restricted attendance at live events throughout North America producing large-scale event cancellations and meaningfully reduced purchases made on our platform. The resulting decline in revenue and broader economic impact of the pandemic led us to determine that an impairment triggering event existed during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, resulting in an impairment charge of $573.8 million to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, definite-lived intangible assets, and other long-lived assets. These factors contributed to a net loss of $774.2 million in 2020.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2021, and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2021, we have seen a recovery in ticket orders as mitigation measures ease. For the second half of 2021, our annualized order volume exceeded 2019 levels. While we continued to recognize a net loss in 2021, we realized significant year-over-year increases in revenues and operating income. Our operating income was $76.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is evolving and the ultimate pace and timing of recovery continues to remain uncertain. If economic conditions caused by the pandemic were to worsen, our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations may be further materially impacted.\nResults of Operations\nDiscussions of the year ended December 31, 2019 and comparison between the year ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019 can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Vivid Seats\u201d in our Registration Statement.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nRevenues\nThe following table presents revenues by segment (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nTotal revenues increased $408.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase, which occurred in both our Marketplace and Resale segments, resulted from an increase in new orders processed resulting from the resumption of live events and a reduction in event cancellations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic and resulting mitigation measures had a significant adverse effect on order volume and event cancellations during 2020. By the third quarter of 2021, most local governments had lifted large scale restrictions on live events. For the second half of 2021, our annualized order volume exceeded 2019 levels.\nMarketplace\nThe following table presents revenues in our Marketplace segment by event category (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nMarketplace revenues increased $366.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Marketplace revenues resulted primarily from an overall increase in new orders processed on our Marketplace platform combined with fewer event cancellation charges.\nTotal Marketplace orders increased 5.6 million, or 523%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in orders resulted from the increase in events held after restrictions on fan attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic were reduced or lifted. These increases occurred across all event categories with the greatest increase in sports.\nCancellation charges, which are recognized as a reduction to revenues, were $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $76.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to the mass cancellations of live events during the initial phases of the pandemic in 2020, cancellation charges were higher in 2020 compared to 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized an increase in revenue of $5.1 million and a decrease of $15.3 million, respectively, due to the impact of cancellation charges for cancelled events where the performance obligations were satisfied in prior periods.\nMarketplace revenues by business model consisted of the following (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nThe increases in revenue from both Owned Properties and Private Label during the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted primarily from the increase in order volume resulting from the loosening of restrictions on live events and fewer event cancellations than the year ended December 31, 2020.\nResale\nRevenue for our Resale segment increased $41.6 million, or 352%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase resulted primarily from higher order volume. Total Resale orders increased 0.1 million, or 305%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Cancellation charges, classified as a reduction of revenue, negatively impacted Resale revenue by $2.8 million and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCost of Revenues (exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization)\nThe following table presents cost of revenues by segment (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nTotal cost of revenues increased $65.9 million, or 267%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase to total cost of revenues resulted from higher order volume in both our Marketplace and Resale segments.\nMarketplace\nMarketplace cost of revenues increased $38.0 million, or 276%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cost of revenues is consistent with the increase in total Marketplace orders, which increased by 5.6 million orders, or 523%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nResale\nResale cost of revenues increased $28.0 million, or 255%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase resulted from an increase in total Resale orders of 0.1 million orders, or 305%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Resale cost of revenues is not consistent with the increase in Resale revenues due to higher ticket prices and margins in 2021 compared to 2020. Cancellation charges resulted in a reduction to Resale cost of revenues of $1.4 million and $4.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nMarketing and Selling\nThe following table presents marketing and selling expenses (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nMarketing and selling expenses, which are entirely attributable to our Marketplace segment, increased $143.2 million, or 376%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in expenses primarily resulted from greater spending on online advertising during the second half of 2021. Our spending on online advertising increased by $126.2 million, or 369%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. As restrictions on the attendance of live events were reduced or lifted, we increased our spending on marketing to capitalize on the increase in live event attendance. In addition, starting in the fourth quarter of 2021, we increased our marketing efforts in additional offline channels including broadcast TV and radio as part of our brand awareness efforts.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe following table presents general and administrative expenses (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nTotal general and administrative expenses increased $26.0 million, or 39%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Other general and administrative expenses increased $13.2 million, or 61%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $9.5 million increase in consulting and professional service fees related to the Merger Transaction, a $3.8 million increase in legal fees, and a $0.5 million increase in legal settlement expenses. Additionally, there was a $3.5 million increase in other general and administrative expenses, primarily related to an increase in licensed software costs and rent expenses. This was offset by a $4.1 million decrease in other expenses, primarily related to a decrease in charitable contributions as a result of the reduction in event cancellations in 2021 compared to 2020.\nPersonnel expenses increased $9.9 million, or 26%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to higher employee headcount and an increase in costs for our outsourced customer service provider primarily due to the increase in order volume. This was partially offset by government payroll subsidies for U.S. and Canadian employers.\nNon-income tax expenses increased $3.0 million, or 42%, of which $2.2 million was related to sales tax expense, and the remainder related to non-income based taxes. This increase primarily resulted from higher order volume.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses decreased $45.9 million, or 95%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the impairment of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nImpairment Charges\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we incurred impairment charges of $573.8 million. These impairment charges were triggered by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the effects of the pandemic, we experienced a substantial reduction of revenue during the first half of 2020, which continued through the remainder of the year and into the first half of 2021. We have not incurred any impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOther Expenses\nThe following table presents other expenses (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nInterest expense - net\nInterest expense increased $0.7 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Although we paid off the May 2020 First Lien Loan and made a partial payment of the outstanding principal on the June 2017 First Lien Loan on October 18, 2021, interest expense was similar to the prior year due to the timing of when we entered into the May 2020 First Lien Loan and made the debt repayments in 2021. In addition, the interest rate cap and interest rate swaps matured during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt increased $35.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to our full repayment of the May 2020 First Lien Loan and a partial repayment of the outstanding principal on the June 2017 First Lien Loan. The loss includes $28.0 million for a prepayment penalty and $6.1 million for the amortization of the remaining balance of the original issuance discount and issuance costs related to the repayment of the May 2020 First Lien Loan in full, as well as $1.7 million for the amortization of the balance of the original issuance discount and issuance costs related to the partial repayment of the outstanding principal on the June 2017 First Lien Loan.\nOther expenses\nOther expenses were $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to our modification of the terms of Class A Public Warrants in connection with the Merger Transaction. There were no other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have historically financed our operations primarily through cash generated from our operating activities. Our primary short-term requirements for liquidity and capital are to fund general working capital, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements. Our primary long-term liquidity needs are related to debt repayment and potential acquisitions.\nOur primary sources of funds are cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings, including our term loans. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we borrowed $50.0 million under our revolving credit facility in March 2020 and subsequently entered into the May 2020 First Lien Loan (defined below). We received $251.5 million in net cash proceeds from the May 2020 First Lien Loan, which we used to repay the $50.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility in May 2020 and to fund our operations. As noted in the Liquidity and Capital Resources-Loan Agreements\u201d section below, we repaid the May 2020 First Lien Loan in connection with, and using the proceeds from, the Merger Transaction and the PIPE Subscription. Our existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for the next 12 months.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $489.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of interest-bearing deposit accounts, money market accounts managed by financial institutions, and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we have generated positive cash flows from our operating activities. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, we repaid $190.7 million of outstanding June 2017 First Lien Loan and added a new revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million.\nLoan Agreements\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we borrowed $50.0 million under the Revolving Facility in March 2020. We then entered into the May 2020 First Lien Loan, which resulted in $251.5 million in net cash proceeds. We used the net cash proceeds from the May 2020 First Lien Loan to immediately repay the $50.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility and to fund our operations. The Revolving Facility was terminated in full simultaneously with the repayment in May 2020.\nThe May 2020 First Lien Loan, which is pari passu with the June 2017 First Lien Loan, carries a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 9.50%, or a base rate plus an applicable margin of 8.50%. The May 2020 First Lien Loan matures in May 2026, subject to an earlier springing maturity date of June 30, 2024 if the June 2017 First Lien Loan, or a refinancing thereof with scheduled payments of principal prior to June 30, 2024, remains outstanding as of that date. The effective interest rate on the May 2020 First Lien Loan, which fluctuates based on certain paid-in-kind elections, was 11.50% per annum as of December 31, 2020. We made no payments during 2020 on the May 2020 First Lien Term Loan. Interest incurred under the May 2020 First Lien Loan was capitalized into the principal quarterly in August and November 2020, resulting in an outstanding principal of $275.7 million as of December 31, 2020. Additional interest was capitalized into the principal in the first nine months of 2021, resulting in an outstanding principal of $304.1 million as of September 30, 2021. On October 18, 2021, we repaid this loan in full in connection with, and using the proceeds from, the Merger Transaction and the PIPE Subscription and incurred a $28.0 million prepayment penalty.\nWe have an outstanding loan balance of $465.7 million under the June 2017 First Lien Loan as of December 31, 2021, which matures on June 30, 2024. Under the June 2017 First Lien Loan, we make quarterly principal payments of $1.6 million, reduced by certain prepayments. Principal payments amounted to $4.8 million and $5.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effective interest rate on the June 2017 First Lien Loan, which fluctuates based on market interest rates, was 4.5% per annum as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. In 2021, in addition to the required quarterly principal payments, we paid $148.2 million of the outstanding loan balance in\nconnection with, and using the proceeds from, the Merger Transaction and the PIPE Subscription. We made no payments under the June 2017 First Lien Loan during 2020, aside from the required quarterly principal payments.\nUpon closing of the Merger Transaction and receipt of cash proceeds under the PIPE Subscription on October 18, 2021, we significantly reduced loan amounts outstanding. As of December 31, 2021, we are only party to one credit facility, the June 2017 First Lien Loan.\nOn February 3, 2022, we repaid $190.7 million of outstanding June 2017 First Lien Loan. We entered into an amendment which refinances the remaining existing term loan with a new $275.0 million term loan with a maturity date of February 3, 2029, adds a new revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million with a maturity date of February 3, 2027, replaces the LIBOR based floating interest rate with a term SOFR based floating interest rate and revises the springing financial covenant to require compliance with a first lien net leverage ratio.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nIn connection with the Merger Transaction as described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Vivid Seats Inc. entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with the existing Hoya Intermediate shareholders that will provide for payment to Hoya Intermediate shareholders of 85% of the amount of the tax savings, if any, that we realize (or, under certain circumstances, is deemed to realize) as a result of, or attributable to, (i) increases in the tax basis of assets owned directly or indirectly by Hoya Intermediate or its subsidiaries from, among other things, any redemptions or exchanges of Hoya Intermediate common units (ii) existing tax basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions arising from such tax basis) in long-lived assets owned directly or indirectly by Hoya Intermediate and its subsidiaries, and (iii) certain other tax benefits (including deductions in respect of imputed interest) related to Hoya Intermediate making payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nCash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $219.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to $19.1 million in net loss, non-cash charges of $75.3 million, and net cash inflows from a $163.8 million change in net operating assets. The net cash inflows from the change in our net operating assets were primarily due to a $128.2 million increase in accounts payable, $19.2 million increase in deferred revenue, and a $14.2 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $7.6 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $4.3 million increase in inventory. Each of these resulted from higher order volume and lower event cancellations in 2021.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to $774.2 million in net loss, non-cash charges of $646.8 million, and net cash outflows from a $93.5 million change in net operating assets. The net cash outflows from the change in net operating assets were primarily due to an increase of $195.4 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $67.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $28.7 million decrease in accounts payable. These changes primarily resulted from lower order volume and higher cancellation rates in 2020.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $76.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to $53.8 million in net loss, non-cash charges of $104.5 million, and net cash outflows from a $25.8 million change in net operating assets. The net cash outflows from the change in net operating assets were primarily due to a $23.3 million\nincrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities resulting from an increase in accrued taxes and other expenses.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 which primarily included $8.4 million in capital spending on development activities related to our platform.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily included $7.3 million in capital spending on development activities related to our platform.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $40.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which primarily included $31.1 million in acquisition related costs and $7.9 million in capital spending on development activities related to our platform.\nCash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This was due to capital contributions of $752.9 million, offset by $485.1 million in debt payments and debt extinguishment costs, $236.0 million of preferred equity redemptions, $20.1 million of Merger Transaction costs, and $17.7 million of dividends paid.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $245.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which resulted primarily from $260.0 million in proceeds from our May 2020 First Lien Loan. This was partially offset by $6.5 million arranger fee on the May 2020 First Lien Loan, $5.9 million in principal payments on our June 2017 First Lien Loan, and $2.1 million in other debt-related costs. We also borrowed $50.0 million under our Revolving Facility, which we subsequently repaid in 2020.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $55.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We paid $40.0 million to extinguish our June 2017 Second Lien Loan. We made $8.1 million in tax distributions to noncontrolling interest holders and $7.0 million in payments related to our June 2017 First Lien Loan.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). Preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition; equity-based compensation, warrants and earnouts, and impairment of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, definite-lived intangible assets, and long-lived assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, these are the policies that are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our Consolidated Balance Sheets, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from our Marketplace segment primarily consists of service and delivery fees from ticketing operations, reduced by incentives provided to ticket buyers. We also recognize revenue for referral fees earned on the purchase of ticket insurance by ticket buyers from third-party insurers. We recognize revenue from our Marketplace segment when the ticket seller confirms an order with the ticket buyer, at which point the seller is obligated to deliver the\ntickets to the ticket buyer in accordance with the original marketplace listing. Revenue from Marketplace transactions is recognized on a net basis because we act as an agent for these transactions.\nWe estimate and reserve for future cancellation charges based on historical trends, with the corresponding charge reducing revenue. This reserve, known as accrued future customer compensation, is classified within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, with a corresponding asset for expected recoveries from ticket sellers recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSpecific judgments and assumptions considered when estimating future cancellation charges include historical cancellation charges as a percentage of sales, the average length of time to realize such charges, and the potential exposure based on the volume of recent sales activity. Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, estimates for future cancellation charges resulting from event cancellations have been determined based on historical event cancellation rates since the start of the pandemic and management's estimates of future event cancellation trends in the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSuch estimates are inherently uncertain as we are unable to predict the rate at which actual cancellation charges will occur. To the extent that actual cancellation charges are materially different than previously estimated amounts, or changes in recent trends require updates to previously reserved amounts, revenue may be materially impacted. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, cancellation charge reserves increased materially in 2020 due to the large volume of cancellations that occurred from the pandemic. In 2021, reserves reduced due to reductions in estimated future cancellation rates. Should actual cancellation charges exceed previous estimates by a significant amount in a given period, we may experience negative overall revenue.\nWhen an event is cancelled, ticket buyers may receive either a cash refund or credit for future purchases in our marketplace. Credits issued to buyers for cancellations are recorded as accrued customer compensation within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. When a credit is redeemed, revenue is recognized for the newly placed order. Breakage income from customer credits that are not expected to be used is estimated and recognized as revenue in proportion to the pattern of redemption for the customer credits that are used. We estimate breakage based on historical usage trends for credit issued by us and available data on comparable programs. Our estimates of breakage are constrained by our limited history of customer credits.\nWe also offer our customers the opportunity to participate in our loyalty program, Vivid Seats Rewards, through our Marketplace segment, which allows customers to earn and redeem credits on Owned Properties transactions. We defer revenue associated with these credits, which is recorded as Deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred amount is based on expected future usage and is recognized as revenue when the credits are redeemed. To the extent that actual usage differs from expected usage, or that recent trends require a change in the estimated usage rate of unexpired credits, our revenue will be impacted by the change.\nRevenue from our Resale business primarily consists of sales of tickets to customers through online secondary ticket marketplaces. We recognize Resale revenue on a gross basis because we act as a principal in these transactions. We recognize Resale revenue when an order is confirmed.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe account for Restricted Stock Units (\"RSUs\"), stock options, and profits interest at fair value as of the grant date. The restricted stock units vest on a quarterly basis over a four-year period for non-directors and on an annual basis over a five-year period for directors. The stock options vest on a quarterly basis over a four-year period and expire ten years from the date of the grant. Both are subject to the recipient's continued employment through the applicable vesting date. The fair value of stock options granted to certain employees is estimated on the grant date using the Hull-White model, a lattice model which assumes holders will exercise when they achieve certain return thresholds. The model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation, including the sub-optimal exercise factor ( SOEF\u201d), the volatility of our common stock, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. We estimate the fair value of profits interest using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which includes assumptions related to volatility, expected term, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. Expense related\nto grants of equity-based awards is recognized as equity-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, Definite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess goodwill and our indefinite-lived intangible asset (our trademark) for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. We assess definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets (collectively, long-lived assets\u201d) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.\nWe identified the COVID-19 pandemic as a potential triggering event for impairment of our goodwill, indefinite-lived trademark, and long-lived assets. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we evaluated the qualitative assessment by reviewing factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, entity-specific financial performance and other events, including changes in our management. Our annual assessment resulted in no impairment triggers after qualitative assessment for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the second quarter of 2020, we identified the COVID-19 pandemic as a triggering event for our long-lived assets, goodwill, indefinite-lived trademark, and definite-lived intangible assets and our quantitative assessment resulted in impairment charges of $573.8 million.\nDue to global social distancing efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus, in addition to compliance with restrictions enacted by various governmental entities, most live events during 2020 were either postponed or cancelled. Beginning in the second quarter of 2021, there was an increase in new orders processed resulting from the resumption of live events and a reduction in event cancellations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic and resulting mitigation measures had a significant adverse effect on order volume and event cancellations during 2020.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Asset (Trademark)\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Our goodwill and our indefinite-lived trademark are held by our Marketplace segment, which contains one reporting unit.\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization and is reviewed for impairment annually, or earlier whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, with an impairment charge recognized for the difference.\nWhen reviewing goodwill for impairment, we begin by performing a qualitative assessment, which includes, but is not limited to, reviewing factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, entity-specific financial performance and other events, including changes in our management. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then perform a quantitative assessment. Depending upon the results of that assessment, the recorded goodwill may be written down, and impairment expense is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit.\nOur goodwill balance is not currently at risk for additional impairment, as the fair value of our Marketplace reporting unit significantly exceeds its carrying value. For the year ended December 31, 2021, as part of our annual assessment, a qualitative goodwill assessment was performed and we determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur management's discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as disclosed in our registration statement on Form S-4A, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 23, 2021 (the \"Registration Statement\"). This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the section titled \"Forward-Looking Statements,\" \"Risk Factors\" or in other parts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\nOverview\nWe are an online ticket marketplace that utilizes our technology platform to connect fans of live events seamlessly with ticket sellers. Our mission is to empower and enable fans to Experience It Live. We believe live events deliver some of life's most exciting moments. Our platform provides ticket buyers and sellers with an easy-to-use and trusted marketplace experience that enables fans to purchase tickets to live events and create new memories. We believe we differentiate from competitors by offering extensive breadth and depth of ticket listings at a competitive value. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, our revenues were $443.0 million, $35.1 million, and $468.9 million, respectively, and Marketplace Gross Order Value (\"Marketplace GOV\") was $2,399.1 million, $347.3 million, and $2,279.8 million, respectively. Our net loss was $19.1 million, $774.2 million, and $53.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur Business Model\nWe operate our business in two segments, Marketplace and Resale.\nMarketplace\nThrough our Marketplace segment, we act as an intermediary between ticket buyers and ticket sellers. We earn revenue processing ticket sales from our Owned Properties, consisting of the Vivid Seats website and mobile applications, and from our Private Label offering, which comprises numerous distribution partners. Using our online platform, we process customer payments, coordinate ticket deliveries, and provide customer service to ticket buyers.\nA key component of our platform is Skybox, a proprietary enterprise resource planning tool used by many of our ticket sellers. Skybox is a free-to-use system that helps ticket sellers manage ticket inventories, adjust pricing, and fulfill orders across multiple secondary ticket marketplaces.\nWe primarily earn revenue from service and delivery fees charged to ticket buyers. We also earn referral fee revenue by offering event ticket insurance to ticket buyers, using a third-party insurance provider. We do not hold ticket inventory in the Marketplace segment. We incur costs for developing and maintaining our platform, providing back-office and customer support to ticket buyers and ticket sellers, processing payments, and shipping tickets. We also incur substantial marketing costs, primarily related to online advertising.\nResale\nIn our Resale segment, we acquire tickets to resell on secondary ticketing marketplaces, including our own. Our Resale segment also provides internal research and development support for Skybox and our ongoing efforts to deliver best in class seller software and tools.\nKey Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use the following metrics to evaluate our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe these metrics provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team.\nThe following table summarizes our key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measure for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketplace GOV(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,399,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>347,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,279,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Marketplace orders(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Resale orders(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>303\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(80,204\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Marketplace GOV represents the total transactional amount of Marketplace segment orders placed on our platform in a period, inclusive of fees, exclusive of taxes, and net of event cancellations that occurred during that period. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Marketplace GOV was negatively impacted by event cancellations in the amount of $108.0 million, compared to $216.0 million and $22.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(2)Total Marketplace orders represents the volume of Marketplace segment orders placed on our platform during a period, net of event cancellations that occurred during that period. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our Marketplace segment experienced 257,109 event cancellations, compared to 549,085 and 54,961 event cancellations during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(3)Total Resale orders represents the volume of Resale segment orders in a period, net of event cancellations that occurred during that period. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our Resale segment experienced 6,165 event cancellations, compared to 20,644 and 1,517 event cancellations during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(4)Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined under GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Refer to the Adjusted EBITDA section below for a reconciliation to its most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nMarketplace GOV\nMarketplace GOV is a key driver of our Marketplace segment's revenue. Marketplace GOV represents the total transactional amount of Marketplace orders in a period, inclusive of fees, exclusive of taxes, and net of event cancellations that occurred during that period. Marketplace GOV reflects our ability to attract and retain customers, as well as the overall health of the industry.\nOur Marketplace GOV is impacted by seasonality, and typically sees increased activity in the fourth quarter when all major sports leagues are in season and we experience increases in order volume for theater and concert events during the holiday season. Quarterly fluctuations in our Marketplace GOV result from the number of cancellations, the popularity and demand of performers, tours, teams, and events, and the length and team composition of sports playoff series and championship games.\nOur Marketplace GOV increased during the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of higher sales volume and fewer event cancellations following an overall reduction in mitigation measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTotal Marketplace Orders\nTotal Marketplace orders represents the volume of Marketplace segment orders placed on our platform in a period, net of event cancellations. An order can include one or more tickets and/or parking passes. Total Marketplace orders allow us to monitor order volume and better identify trends within our Marketplace segment. Total Marketplace orders increased during the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of higher sales volume and fewer event cancellations following an overall reduction in mitigation measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTotal Resale Orders\nTotal Resale orders represents the volume of Resale segment orders sold in a period, net of event cancellations. An order can include one or more tickets and/or parking passes. Total Resale orders allow us to monitor order volume and better identify trends within our Resale segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, because it is a measure frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Further, we believe this measure is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results because it excludes the impact of items that are outside the control of management or not reflective of ongoing performance related directly to the operation of our business segments.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key measurement used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to analyzing operating expenses, evaluating performance, and performing strategic planning and annual budgeting. Moreover, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance and highlighting trends in our operating results.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, net loss, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,129\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(774,185\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(53,848\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales tax liability(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Transaction costs(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity-based compensation(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Senior management transition costs(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on extinguishment of debt(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Litigation, settlements and related costs(6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change to annual bonus program(7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Customer loyalty program stand-up costs(8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impairment charges(9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on asset disposals(10)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Severance related to COVID-19(11)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in value of warrants(12)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(80,204\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) We have historically incurred sales tax expense in jurisdictions where we expected to remit sales tax payments but were not yet collecting from customers. During the second half of 2021, we began collecting sales tax from customers in all required states. The sales tax liability presented herein represents the exposure for sales tax prior to the date we began collecting sales tax from customers reduced by abatements received.\n(2) Transaction costs consist of legal; accounting; tax and other professional fees; as well as personnel-related costs, which consist of severance and retention bonuses; and integration costs. Transaction costs recognized in 2021 were related to the Merger Transaction (as defined below), to the extent they were not eligible for capitalization, and the acquisition of Betcha Sports, Inc. (\"Betcha\"). Transaction costs recognized in 2020 were related to the acquisition of Fanxchange Ltd. in 2019. In 2019, we completed the acquisition of Fanxchange Ltd. and attempted to pursue an acquisition that was ultimately abandoned. These acquisition-related costs are not representative of normal, recurring, cash operating expenses.\n(3) We incur equity-based compensation expenses for profits interests issued prior to the Merger Transaction and equity granted according to the 2021 Incentive Award Plan (\"2021 Plan\"), which we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. The 2021 Plan was approved and adopted in order to facilitate the grant of equity incentive awards to our employees and directors. The 2021 Plan became effective on October 18, 2021.\n(4) In 2019, we incurred costs associated with the transition to our current senior management team, including our Chief Executive Officer. These costs include recruiting costs and costs to compensate our Chief Executive Officer for benefits forfeited at his previous employer.\n(5) Losses incurred resulted from the retirement of the May 2020 First Lien Loan and fees paid related to the early payment of a portion of the principal of the June 2017 First Lien Loan in October 2021, the retirement of the revolving credit facility in May 2020, and the repayment of the $40.0 million second lien term loan in 2019.\n(6) These expenses relate to external legal costs and settlement costs, which were unrelated to our core business operations.\n(7) We restructured our employee incentive compensation plan during 2019.\n(8) During August 2019, we initiated the Vivid Seats Rewards customer loyalty program. We incurred $3.2 million of initial stand-up costs related to the commencement of the program. These stand-up costs consist primarily of customer incentives and marketing costs, which are not expected to reoccur.\n(9) We incurred impairment charges triggered by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2020. The impairment charges resulted in a reduction in the carrying values of our goodwill, indefinite-lived trademark, definite-lived intangible assets, and other long-lived assets.\n(10) We incur losses on asset disposals, which are not considered indicative of our core operating performance.\n(11) These charges relate to severance costs resulting from significant reductions in employee headcount due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n(12) These expenses relate to the modification of the terms of the Class A Public Warrants in connection with the Merger Transaction and revaluation of Hoya Intermediate Warrants (defined below) following the Merger Transaction.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nOur operational and financial results have been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of factors that present significant opportunities as well as risks and challenges, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\u201d The key factors discussed below impacted our 2021 results or are anticipated to impact our 2022 results.\nGrowth and retention of customers and sellers\nOur revenue growth primarily depends on acquiring and retaining customers. We seek to have ticket buyers and sellers view us as their destination ticketing marketplace when searching for, purchasing and selling event tickets. We believe we differentiate from competitors by offering extensive breadth and depth of ticket listings at a competitive value, and by providing a reliable and secure experience for ticket buyers. We acquire new ticket buyers through marketing, partnerships, brand advertisement and word-of-mouth. Performance marketing channels are\nhighly competitive, and we must continue to be effective in these acquisition channels. We seek to retain customers by offering an optimal customer experience, providing additional avenues for engagement and outreach such as customized emails, and providing value to our customers such as with our Vivid Seats Rewards program. Likewise, we must preserve our longstanding relationships with ticket sellers to maintain extensive ticket listing options at competitive prices. We recognize the importance of seller and other distribution relationships in the ticketing ecosystem and offer products and services designed to support the needs of our sellers and distribution partners.\nDuring 2021, we experienced a dramatic increase in new orders processed starting in the second quarter alongside the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination programs across the United States and supported by our investments in revamped branding and product enhancements to attract new and reattract prior customers. We also experienced a significant reduction in event cancellations in 2021 as compared to 2020. Our expenses increased on a similar trajectory over the course of the year as we increased our marketing spend and efforts, hired additional personnel, and had additional outsourced customer service provider costs to capitalize on the increase in live event attendance and handle the increased order demand.\nSupply of Concert, Sporting, and Theatre Events\nA reduction in the number of live concert, sporting and theater events will have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income. Many of the factors affecting the number and availability of live concert, sporting and theater events are beyond our control. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our Marketplace segment experienced 257,109 event cancellations and our Resale segment experienced 6,165 event cancellations.\nAttracting and retaining talent\nWe rely on the ability to attract and retain employees. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. As a company, we share the dedication to our mission to Experience It Live. We believe offering employees an engaging and positive work environment contributes to both their success and our success. We are committed to fostering an environment that is inclusive and welcome to diversity in backgrounds, experiences and thoughts as a means toward achieving employee engagement, empowerment, innovation and good decision-making. As of December 31, 2021, we had 430 full-time employees which increased over 80% from 236 full-time employees as of December 31, 2020. We expect our employee count to further increase in 2022.\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a significant negative impact on our business, operational and financial results. While we have seen recovery in the demand for live events with an increase in ticket orders, as well as an increasing number of live events held in 2021 as compared to 2020, we could be adversely affected if new variants emerge and if COVID-19 case counts increase. As of December 31, 2021, most jurisdictions permit full capacity and many events are taking place as planned. Some events, however, continue to be cancelled, rescheduled, or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If economic conditions caused by the pandemic do not continue to recover, including as a result of potential developments with variants of the virus or other market-disrupting events, our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations may be further impacted.\nTicketing Industry Competition\nOur business faces significant competition from other national, regional and local primary and secondary ticketing service providers. We also face competition in the resale of tickets from other professional ticket resellers. We must continue to innovate and offer our buyers, sellers and partners an attractive value proposition.\nSeasonality\nOur operational and financial results can be impacted by seasonality, with increased activity in the fourth quarter when all major sports leagues are in season and we experience an increase in order volume for theater and concert events during the holiday season. In addition to typical seasonality impacts to our business, our quarterly results and quarterly year-over-year growth rates can be impacted by:\n\u2022sports teams performance, the number of playoff games in a series and teams involved;\n\u2022the timing of tours of top grossing acts;\n\u2022tour and game cancellations due to weather, illness or other factors; and\n\u2022popularity and demand for certain performers and events.\nIn 2021, the impacts of COVID-19 resulted in unique impacts to our business beyond normal course seasonality. In particular, we experienced a dramatic increase in new orders processed starting in the second quarter alongside the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination programs across the United States. We expect the continued return of live events as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, subject to potential developments with variants of the virus or other market-disrupting events, to continue to be most impactful in the near term.\nRecent Developments\nThe Business Combination\nOn October 18, 2021, we consummated the Merger Transaction. The Merger Transaction was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with Hoya Intermediate, a subsidiary of Vivid Seats Inc., treated as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of the combined company represent a continuation of the financial statements of Hoya Intermediate. In connection with the Merger Transaction, Vivid Seats also entered into a private investment in public equity financing ( PIPE Subscription\u201d). Pursuant to the PIPE Subscription, Vivid Seats raised an additional $250.2 million. In addition, Hoya Intermediate paid Eldridge Industries, LLC $11.7 million in cash at the closing of the Merger Transaction for a backstop fee.\nProceeds from the Merger Transaction and the PIPE Subscription were used for debt repayment and capital structure optimization. We declared and paid a special dividend of $17.7 million, or $0.23 per share, to holders of Class A Common Stock in 2021.\nBetcha Acquisition\nOn December 13, 2021, we acquired 100% of the equity interests of Betcha. Betcha is a real money daily fantasy sports app with social and gamification features that enhance fans' connection with their favorite live sports. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred consisted of approximately $0.8 million in cash and 2,143,438 shares of Class A common stock. The total consideration includes cash earnouts of $7.5 million as of the acquisition date representing the estimated fair value that we may be obligated to pay if Betcha meets certain earnings objectives following the acquisition. In addition, the purchase consideration includes future milestone payments of $9.7 million as of the acquisition date representing the estimated fair value that we may be obligated to pay upon the achievement of certain integration objectives.\nCOVID-19 Has Had a Disproportionately Negative Effect on the Live Entertainment Industry\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Almost immediately, mitigation measures implemented or recommended by governmental authorities and private organizations restricted attendance at live events throughout North America producing large-scale event cancellations and meaningfully reduced purchases made on our platform. The resulting decline in revenue and broader economic impact of the pandemic led us to determine that an impairment triggering event existed during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, resulting in an impairment charge of $573.8 million to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, definite-lived intangible assets, and other long-lived assets. These factors contributed to a net loss of $774.2 million in 2020.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2021, and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2021, we have seen a recovery in ticket orders as mitigation measures ease. For the second half of 2021, our annualized order volume exceeded 2019 levels. While we continued to recognize a net loss in 2021, we realized significant year-over-year increases in revenues and operating income. Our operating income was $76.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is evolving and the ultimate pace and timing of recovery continues to remain uncertain. If economic conditions caused by the pandemic were to worsen, our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations may be further materially impacted.\nResults of Operations\nDiscussions of the year ended December 31, 2019 and comparison between the year ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019 can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Vivid Seats\u201d in our Registration Statement.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>443,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>407,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1163\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>267\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketing and selling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45,925\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(573,838\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(716,018\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>792,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense -

The increase, which occurred in both our Marketplace and Resale segments, resulted from an increase in new orders processed resulting from the resumption of live events and a reduction in event cancellations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic and resulting mitigation measures had a significant adverse effect on order volume and event cancellations during 2020. By the third quarter of 2021, most local governments had lifted large scale restrictions on live events. For the second half of 2021, our annualized order volume exceeded 2019 levels.\nMarketplace\nThe following table presents revenues in our Marketplace segment by event category (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Concerts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>985\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sports\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,936\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Theater\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,011\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>395\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Marketplace revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>366,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,574\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarketplace revenues increased $366.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Marketplace revenues resulted primarily from an overall increase in new orders processed on our Marketplace platform combined with fewer event cancellation charges.\nTotal Marketplace orders increased 5.6 million, or 523%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in orders resulted from the increase in events held after restrictions on fan attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic were reduced or lifted. These increases occurred across all event categories with the greatest increase in sports.\nCancellation charges, which are recognized as a reduction to revenues, were $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $76.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to the mass cancellations of live events during the initial phases of the pandemic in 2020, cancellation charges were higher in 2020 compared to 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized an increase in revenue of $5.1 million and a decrease of $15.3 million, respectively, due to the impact of cancellation charges for cancelled events where the performance obligations were satisfied in prior periods.\nMarketplace revenues by business model consisted of the following (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Owned Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>308,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>284,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,174\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Private Label\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(907\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,079\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Marketplace revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>366,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,574\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increases in revenue from both Owned Properties and Private Label during the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted primarily from the increase in order volume resulting from the loosening of restrictions on live events and fewer event cancellations than the year ended December 31, 2020.\nResale\nRevenue for our Resale segment increased $41.6 million, or 352%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase resulted primarily from higher order volume. Total Resale orders increased 0.1 million, or 305%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Cancellation charges, classified as a reduction of revenue, negatively impacted Resale revenue by $2.8 million and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCost of Revenues (exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization)\nThe following table presents cost of revenues by segment (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketplace\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>276\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Resale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>267\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal cost of revenues increased $65.9 million, or 267%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase to total cost of revenues resulted from higher order volume in both our Marketplace and Resale segments.\nMarketplace\nMarketplace cost of revenues increased $38.0 million, or 276%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cost of revenues is consistent with the increase in total Marketplace orders, which increased by 5.6 million orders, or 523%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nResale\nResale cost of revenues increased $28.0 million, or 255%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase resulted from an increase in total Resale orders of 0.1 million orders, or 305%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Resale cost of revenues is not consistent with the increase in Resale revenues due to higher ticket prices and margins in 2021 compared to 2020. Cancellation charges resulted in a reduction to Resale cost of revenues of $1.4 million and $4.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nMarketing and Selling\nThe following table presents marketing and selling expenses (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketing and selling:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Online\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>369\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Offline\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>436\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total marketing and selling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarketing and selling expenses, which are entirely attributable to our Marketplace segment, increased $143.2 million, or 376%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in expenses primarily resulted from greater spending on online advertising during the second half of 2021. Our spending on online advertising increased by $126.2 million, or 369%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. As restrictions on the attendance of live events were reduced or lifted, we increased our spending on marketing to capitalize on the increase in live event attendance. In addition, starting in the fourth quarter of 2021, we increased our marketing efforts in additional offline channels including broadcast TV and radio as part of our brand awareness efforts.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe following table presents general and administrative expenses (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Personnel expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-income tax expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal general and administrative expenses increased $26.0 million, or 39%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Other general and administrative expenses increased $13.2 million, or 61%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $9.5 million increase in consulting and professional service fees related to the Merger Transaction, a $3.8 million increase in legal fees, and a $0.5 million increase in legal settlement expenses. Additionally, there was a $3.5 million increase in other general and administrative expenses, primarily related to an increase in licensed software costs and rent expenses. This was offset by a $4.1 million decrease in other expenses, primarily related to a decrease in charitable contributions as a result of the reduction in event cancellations in 2021 compared to 2020.\nPersonnel expenses increased $9.9 million, or 26%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to higher employee headcount and an increase in costs for our outsourced customer service provider primarily due to the increase in order volume. This was partially offset by government payroll subsidies for U.S. and Canadian employers.\nNon-income tax expenses increased $3.0 million, or 42%, of which $2.2 million was related to sales tax expense, and the remainder related to non-income based taxes. This increase primarily resulted from higher order volume.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses decreased $45.9 million, or 95%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the impairment of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nImpairment Charges\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we incurred impairment charges of $573.8 million. These impairment charges were triggered by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the effects of the pandemic, we experienced a substantial reduction of revenue during the first half of 2020, which continued through the remainder of the year and into the first half of 2021. We have not incurred any impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOther Expenses\nThe following table presents other expenses (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense - net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,130\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense - net\nInterest expense increased $0.7 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Although we paid off the May 2020 First Lien Loan and made a partial payment of the outstanding principal on the June 2017 First Lien Loan on October 18, 2021, interest expense was similar to the prior year due to the timing of when we entered into the May 2020 First Lien Loan and made the debt repayments in 2021. In addition, the interest rate cap and interest rate swaps matured during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt increased $35.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to our full repayment of the May 2020 First Lien Loan and a partial repayment of the outstanding principal on the June 2017 First Lien Loan. The loss includes $28.0 million for a prepayment penalty and $6.1 million for the amortization of the remaining balance of the original issuance discount and issuance costs related to the repayment of the May 2020 First Lien Loan in full, as well as $1.7 million for the amortization of the balance of the original issuance discount and issuance costs related to the partial repayment of the outstanding principal on the June 2017 First Lien Loan.\nOther expenses\nOther expenses were $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to our modification of the terms of Class A Public Warrants in connection with the Merger Transaction. There were no other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have historically financed our operations primarily through cash generated from our operating activities. Our primary short-term requirements for liquidity and capital are to fund general working capital, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements. Our primary long-term liquidity needs are related to debt repayment and potential acquisitions.\nOur primary sources of funds are cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings, including our term loans. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we borrowed $50.0 million under our revolving credit facility in March 2020 and subsequently entered into the May 2020 First Lien Loan (defined below). We received $251.5 million in net cash proceeds from the May 2020 First Lien Loan, which we used to repay the $50.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility in May 2020 and to fund our operations. As noted in the Liquidity and Capital Resources-Loan Agreements\u201d section below, we repaid the May 2020 First Lien Loan in connection with, and using the proceeds from, the Merger Transaction and the PIPE Subscription. Our existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for the next 12 months.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $489.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of interest-bearing deposit accounts, money market accounts managed by financial institutions, and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we have generated positive cash flows from our operating activities. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, we repaid $190.7 million of outstanding June 2017 First Lien Loan and added a new revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million.\nLoan Agreements\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we borrowed $50.0 million under the Revolving Facility in March 2020. We then entered into the May 2020 First Lien Loan, which resulted in $251.5 million in net cash proceeds. We used the net cash proceeds from the May 2020 First Lien Loan to immediately repay the $50.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility and to fund our operations. The Revolving Facility was terminated in full simultaneously with the repayment in May 2020.\nThe May 2020 First Lien Loan, which is pari passu with the June 2017 First Lien Loan, carries a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 9.50%, or a base rate plus an applicable margin of 8.50%. The May 2020 First Lien Loan matures in May 2026, subject to an earlier springing maturity date of June 30, 2024 if the June 2017 First Lien Loan, or a refinancing thereof with scheduled payments of principal prior to June 30, 2024, remains outstanding as of that date. The effective interest rate on the May 2020 First Lien Loan, which fluctuates based on certain paid-in-kind elections, was 11.50% per annum as of December 31, 2020. We made no payments during 2020 on the May 2020 First Lien Term Loan. Interest incurred under the May 2020 First Lien Loan was capitalized into the principal quarterly in August and November 2020, resulting in an outstanding principal of $275.7 million as of December 31, 2020. Additional interest was capitalized into the principal in the first nine months of 2021, resulting in an outstanding principal of $304.1 million as of September 30, 2021. On October 18, 2021, we repaid this loan in full in connection with, and using the proceeds from, the Merger Transaction and the PIPE Subscription and incurred a $28.0 million prepayment penalty.\nWe have an outstanding loan balance of $465.7 million under the June 2017 First Lien Loan as of December 31, 2021, which matures on June 30, 2024. Under the June 2017 First Lien Loan, we make quarterly principal payments of $1.6 million, reduced by certain prepayments. Principal payments amounted to $4.8 million and $5.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effective interest rate on the June 2017 First Lien Loan, which fluctuates based on market interest rates, was 4.5% per annum as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. In 2021, in addition to the required quarterly principal payments, we paid $148.2 million of the outstanding loan balance in\nconnection with, and using the proceeds from, the Merger Transaction and the PIPE Subscription. We made no payments under the June 2017 First Lien Loan during 2020, aside from the required quarterly principal payments.\nUpon closing of the Merger Transaction and receipt of cash proceeds under the PIPE Subscription on October 18, 2021, we significantly reduced loan amounts outstanding. As of December 31, 2021, we are only party to one credit facility, the June 2017 First Lien Loan.\nOn February 3, 2022, we repaid $190.7 million of outstanding June 2017 First Lien Loan. We entered into an amendment which refinances the remaining existing term loan with a new $275.0 million term loan with a maturity date of February 3, 2029, adds a new revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million with a maturity date of February 3, 2027, replaces the LIBOR based floating interest rate with a term SOFR based floating interest rate and revises the springing financial covenant to require compliance with a first lien net leverage ratio.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nIn connection with the Merger Transaction as described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Vivid Seats Inc. entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with the existing Hoya Intermediate shareholders that will provide for payment to Hoya Intermediate shareholders of 85% of the amount of the tax savings, if any, that we realize (or, under certain circumstances, is deemed to realize) as a result of, or attributable to, (i) increases in the tax basis of assets owned directly or indirectly by Hoya Intermediate or its subsidiaries from, among other things, any redemptions or exchanges of Hoya Intermediate common units (ii) existing tax basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions arising from such tax basis) in long-lived assets owned directly or indirectly by Hoya Intermediate and its subsidiaries, and (iii) certain other tax benefits (including deductions in respect of imputed interest) related to Hoya Intermediate making payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(33,892\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,345\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,605\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40,155\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,113\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>245,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55,462\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>204,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>204,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,139\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $219.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to $19.1 million in net loss, non-cash charges of $75.3 million, and net cash inflows from a $163.8 million change in net operating assets. The net cash inflows from the change in our net operating assets were primarily due to a $128.2 million increase in accounts payable, $19.2 million increase in deferred revenue, and a $14.2 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $7.6 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $4.3 million increase in inventory. Each of these resulted from higher order volume and lower event cancellations in 2021.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to $774.2 million in net loss, non-cash charges of $646.8 million, and net cash outflows from a $93.5 million change in net operating assets. The net cash outflows from the change in net operating assets were primarily due to an increase of $195.4 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $67.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $28.7 million decrease in accounts payable. These changes primarily resulted from lower order volume and higher cancellation rates in 2020.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $76.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to $53.8 million in net loss, non-cash charges of $104.5 million, and net cash outflows from a $25.8 million change in net operating assets. The net cash outflows from the change in net operating assets were primarily due to a $23.3 million\nincrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities resulting from an increase in accrued taxes and other expenses.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 which primarily included $8.4 million in capital spending on development activities related to our platform.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily included $7.3 million in capital spending on development activities related to our platform.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $40.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which primarily included $31.1 million in acquisition related costs and $7.9 million in capital spending on development activities related to our platform.\nCash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This was due to capital contributions of $752.9 million, offset by $485.1 million in debt payments and debt extinguishment costs, $236.0 million of preferred equity redemptions, $20.1 million of Merger Transaction costs, and $17.7 million of dividends paid.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $245.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which resulted primarily from $260.0 million in proceeds from our May 2020 First Lien Loan. This was partially offset by $6.5 million arranger fee on the May 2020 First Lien Loan, $5.9 million in principal payments on our June 2017 First Lien Loan, and $2.1 million in other debt-related costs. We also borrowed $50.0 million under our Revolving Facility, which we subsequently repaid in 2020.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $55.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We paid $40.0 million to extinguish our June 2017 Second Lien Loan. We made $8.1 million in tax distributions to noncontrolling interest holders and $7.0 million in payments related to our June 2017 First Lien Loan.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). Preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition; equity-based compensation, warrants and earnouts, and impairment of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, definite-lived intangible assets, and long-lived assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, these are the policies that are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our Consolidated Balance Sheets, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from our Marketplace segment primarily consists of service and delivery fees from ticketing operations, reduced by incentives provided to ticket buyers. We also recognize revenue for referral fees earned on the purchase of ticket insurance by ticket buyers from third-party insurers. We recognize revenue from our Marketplace segment when the ticket seller confirms an order with the ticket buyer, at which point the seller is obligated to deliver the\ntickets to the ticket buyer in accordance with the original marketplace listing. Revenue from Marketplace transactions is recognized on a net basis because we act as an agent for these transactions.\nWe estimate and reserve for future cancellation charges based on historical trends, with the corresponding charge reducing revenue. This reserve, known as accrued future customer compensation, is classified within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, with a corresponding asset for expected recoveries from ticket sellers recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSpecific judgments and assumptions considered when estimating future cancellation charges include historical cancellation charges as a percentage of sales, the average length of time to realize such charges, and the potential exposure based on the volume of recent sales activity. Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, estimates for future cancellation charges resulting from event cancellations have been determined based on historical event cancellation rates since the start of the pandemic and management's estimates of future event cancellation trends in the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSuch estimates are inherently uncertain as we are unable to predict the rate at which actual cancellation charges will occur. To the extent that actual cancellation charges are materially different than previously estimated amounts, or changes in recent trends require updates to previously reserved amounts, revenue may be materially impacted. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, cancellation charge reserves increased materially in 2020 due to the large volume of cancellations that occurred from the pandemic. In 2021, reserves reduced due to reductions in estimated future cancellation rates. Should actual cancellation charges exceed previous estimates by a significant amount in a given period, we may experience negative overall revenue.\nWhen an event is cancelled, ticket buyers may receive either a cash refund or credit for future purchases in our marketplace. Credits issued to buyers for cancellations are recorded as accrued customer compensation within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. When a credit is redeemed, revenue is recognized for the newly placed order. Breakage income from customer credits that are not expected to be used is estimated and recognized as revenue in proportion to the pattern of redemption for the customer credits that are used. We estimate breakage based on historical usage trends for credit issued by us and available data on comparable programs. Our estimates of breakage are constrained by our limited history of customer credits.\nWe also offer our customers the opportunity to participate in our loyalty program, Vivid Seats Rewards, through our Marketplace segment, which allows customers to earn and redeem credits on Owned Properties transactions. We defer revenue associated with these credits, which is recorded as Deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred amount is based on expected future usage and is recognized as revenue when the credits are redeemed. To the extent that actual usage differs from expected usage, or that recent trends require a change in the estimated usage rate of unexpired credits, our revenue will be impacted by the change.\nRevenue from our Resale business primarily consists of sales of tickets to customers through online secondary ticket marketplaces. We recognize Resale revenue on a gross basis because we act as a principal in these transactions. We recognize Resale revenue when an order is confirmed.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe account for Restricted Stock Units (\"RSUs\"), stock options, and profits interest at fair value as of the grant date. The restricted stock units vest on a quarterly basis over a four-year period for non-directors and on an annual basis over a five-year period for directors. The stock options vest on a quarterly basis over a four-year period and expire ten years from the date of the grant. Both are subject to the recipient's continued employment through the applicable vesting date. The fair value of stock options granted to certain employees is estimated on the grant date using the Hull-White model, a lattice model which assumes holders will exercise when they achieve certain return thresholds. The model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation, including the sub-optimal exercise factor ( SOEF\u201d), the volatility of our common stock, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. We estimate the fair value of profits interest using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which includes assumptions related to volatility, expected term, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. Expense related\nto grants of equity-based awards is recognized as equity-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, Definite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess goodwill and our indefinite-lived intangible asset (our trademark) for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. We assess definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets (collectively, long-lived assets\u201d) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.\nWe identified the COVID-19 pandemic as a potential triggering event for impairment of our goodwill, indefinite-lived trademark, and long-lived assets. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we evaluated the qualitative assessment by reviewing factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, entity-specific financial performance and other events, including changes in our management. Our annual assessment resulted in no impairment triggers after qualitative assessment for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the second quarter of 2020, we identified the COVID-19 pandemic as a triggering event for our long-lived assets, goodwill, indefinite-lived trademark, and definite-lived intangible assets and our quantitative assessment resulted in impairment charges of $573.8 million.\nDue to global social distancing efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus, in addition to compliance with restrictions enacted by various governmental entities, most live events during 2020 were either postponed or cancelled. Beginning in the second quarter of 2021, there was an increase in new orders processed resulting from the resumption of live events and a reduction in event cancellations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic and resulting mitigation measures had a significant adverse effect on order volume and event cancellations during 2020.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Asset (Trademark)\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Our goodwill and our indefinite-lived trademark are held by our Marketplace segment, which contains one reporting unit.\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization and is reviewed for impairment annually, or earlier whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, with an impairment charge recognized for the difference.\nWhen reviewing goodwill for impairment, we begin by performing a qualitative assessment, which includes, but is not limited to, reviewing factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, entity-specific financial performance and other events, including changes in our management. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then perform a quantitative assessment. Depending upon the results of that assessment, the recorded goodwill may be written down, and impairment expense is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit.\nOur goodwill balance is not currently at risk for additional impairment, as the fair value of our Marketplace reporting unit significantly exceeds its carrying value. For the year ended December 31, 2021, as part of our annual assessment, a qualitative goodwill assessment was performed and we determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of"}
