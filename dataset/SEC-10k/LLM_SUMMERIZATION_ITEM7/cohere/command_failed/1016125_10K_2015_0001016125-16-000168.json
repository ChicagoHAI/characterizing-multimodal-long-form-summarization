Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides information we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes that are included in this Form 10-K. Also, the discussion of Critical Accounting Estimates in this section is an integral part of the analysis of our results of operations and financial condition.\nBusiness Overview\nUltimate Software is a leading cloud provider of people management solutions, often referred to as human capital management ( HCM\u201d). Ultimate's UltiPro product suite ( UltiPro\u201d) is a comprehensive, engaging solution that has human resources (\"HR\"), payroll, and benefits management at its core and includes global people management, available in twelve languages with more than 35 country-specific localizations. The solution is delivered primarily via software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") to organizations based in the United States and Canada, including those with global workforces. At the close of 2015, we had approximately 3,200 organizations as customers and more than 25 million people records in our HCM cloud. We attained our leadership position, we believe, through our focus on unified HCM, people-centric product design, cloud technology, and strong customer relationships.\nUltiPro is designed to deliver the functionality businesses need to manage the complete employee life cycle from recruitment to retirement and to facilitate employee engagement with their employers and each other. The solution includes unified feature sets for talent acquisition and onboarding, HR management and compliance, benefits management and online enrollment, payroll, performance management, compensation management with salary planning, budgeting and development of incentive plans, succession management, reporting and analytical decision-making and predictive tools, and time and attendance. UltiPro has role-based features for HR professionals, executives, managers, administrators, and employees whether they are in or out of the office, including access to business-critical information on mobile devices such as the iPhone, iPad, and other smartphones and tablets.\nOur customers tell us that UltiPro helps them to streamline talent management, HR and payroll processes to significantly reduce administrative and operational costs while also empowering them to manage the talent in their workforces more strategically. UltiPro provides our customers with tools to analyze workforce trends for better decision making, identify high-performing talent within their organizations, predict who high-performers will be with a high degree of accuracy, find critical information quickly and perform routine business activities efficiently.\nOur cloud offering of UltiPro provides Web-based access to comprehensive HCM functionality for organizations that want to simplify delivery and support of their business applications. We have found that UltiPro is attractive to companies that want to focus on their core competencies to increase sales and profits. Through UltiPro, we supply and manage the hardware, infrastructure, ongoing maintenance and backup services for our customers. Customer systems are currently managed at four data centers--one located near Atlanta, Georgia, one near Phoenix, Arizona, one near Toronto, Canada, and another near Vancouver, Canada. All data centers are owned and operated by independent third parties.\nWe market our UltiPro solutions primarily to enterprise companies, which we define as companies with more than 1,500 employees, including those with 10,000 or more employees; mid-market companies, which we define as those having approximately 500-1,500 employees; and strategic companies, which we define as having approximately 100-499 employees. Our mid-market and strategic customers have access to nearly all the features that our larger enterprise companies have through UltiPro, plus a bundled services package. Since many companies in the mid- and strategic markets do not have information technology ( IT\u201d) staff on their premises to help with system deployment or ongoing management issues, we have created a bundled services package to give these customers a high degree of convenience by handling system configuration, business rules, and other situations for them behind the scenes.\u201d UltiPro is marketed primarily through our enterprise, mid-market and strategic direct sales teams.\nIn addition to UltiPro's HCM functionality, our customers have the option to purchase a number of additional capabilities on a per-employee-per-month ( PEPM\u201d) basis, which are available to enhance and complement the functionality of UltiPro and which are based on the particular business needs of our customers. These optional UltiPro capabilities currently include (i) the talent acquisition suite (recruitment and onboarding); (ii) the talent management suite (performance management, talent predictors, and succession management); (iii) compensation management; (iv) benefits enrollment; (v) time management; (vi) Select Services which include payment services (formerly referred to as tax filing\u201d), managed services and other specific-need services such as filing Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") compliance documents for customers; (vii) wage attachments; and (viii) other optional features (collectively, Optional Capabilities\u201d).\nIn the fall of 2015, Ultimate began deploying an ACA toolkit that enables our customers to comply with ACA regulations by the 2016 deadline. The toolkit is embedded in UltiPro and automatically populates the Forms 1094-C and 1095-C with the appropriate information. In addition, Ultimate offers our customers additional optional ACA-related services, branded UltiPro ACA Employer Services. These include such services as printing and electronic filing of 1094-C and 1095-C forms to the IRS on our customer's behalf and on-going proactive monitoring and managing of employee eligibility alerts, notices, and penalty responses. UltiPro's tracking of hours worked in payroll ties to UltiPro's benefits management, enabling automatic calculation of employees' hours of service eligibility and providing HR leaders analytical insight into compliance risk related to the ACA delivered in the Healthcare Eligibility Dashboard and via our UltiPro ACA Toolkit.\nAll Optional Capabilities are priced solely on a subscription basis. Some of the Optional Capabilities are available to enterprise, mid-market and strategic customers while others are available exclusively to either enterprise, mid-market or strategic customers, and availability is based on the needs of the respective customers, the number of their employees and the complexity of their HCM environment.\nThe key drivers of our business are (i) growth in recurring revenues; (ii) operating income, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles (\"Non-GAAP Operating Income\"); and (iii) retention of our customers once our solutions are sold ( Customer Retention\u201d). For the year ended December 31, 2015, our (i) recurring revenues grew by 23.1%, compared with the same period in 2014, and (ii) Non-GAAP Operating Income was $126.8 million, or 20.5% of total revenues, as compared with $101.7 million, or 20.1% of total revenues, for the same period in 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our (i) recurring revenues grew by 25.4%, compared with the same period in 2013 and (ii) Non-GAAP Operating Income was $101.7 million, or 20.1% of total revenues, as compared with $76.3 million, or 18.6% of total revenues, for the same period in 2013. As of December 31, 2015, our Customer Retention, on a trailing twelve-month basis, exceeded 97% for our recurring revenue cloud customer base, which compares with greater than 96% for the prior year. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nOur ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend upon the success of our direct sales force and our ability to adapt our sales efforts to address the evolving markets for our products and services. We provide our sales personnel with comprehensive and continuing training with respect to technology and market place developments. Aside from sales commissions, we also provide various incentives to encourage our sales representatives, including stock-based compensation awards based upon performance.\nThe HCM market is intensely competitive. We address competitive pressures through improvements and enhancements to our products and services, the development of additional features of UltiPro and a comprehensive marketing team and process that distinguishes Ultimate and its products from the competition. Our focus on customer service, which enables us to maintain a high Customer Retention rate, also helps us address competitive pressures.\nAs our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions. If general economic conditions were to deteriorate, we may experience delays in our sales cycles, increased pressure from prospective customers to offer discounts and increased pressure from existing customers to renew expiring recurring revenue agreements for lower amounts. We address continuing economic pressures by, among other things, efforts to control growth of our operating expenses through the monitoring of controllable costs and vendor negotiations.\nUltimate has two primary revenue sources: recurring revenues and services revenues. Prior to December 31, 2014, subscription revenues from UltiPro and maintenance revenues were the primary components of recurring revenues. Effective January 1, 2015, the primary component of recurring revenues is subscription revenues from UltiPro for the reasons discussed below. The majority of services revenues are derived from implementation consulting services.\nSubsequent to the discontinuation of selling perpetual licenses of UltiPro to new customers, which occurred in 2009, we sold licenses to existing license customers but only in relation to the customer's employee growth or for Optional Capabilities if the customer already had a perpetual license for the on-site UltiPro solutions. As perpetual license agreements were sold in the past, annual maintenance contracts (priced as a percentage of the related license fee) accompanied those agreements. Maintenance contracts typically had a one-year term with annual renewal periods thereafter. Since 2009 and through December 31, 2014, our maintenance revenues were related to renewal maintenance only. In 2012, we announced that we would no longer support the licensed UltiPro (\"Legacy\") products after December 31, 2014. In the approximate two-year period after the announcement, Ultimate strengthened its campaign to convert Legacy customers to cloud customers. Effective January 1, 2015, we no longer have maintenance revenues associated with our Legacy customers. The small amount of license revenues reflected in the three months ended March 31, 2015, in the Quarterly Results of Operations below, was primarily\nrelated to certain Legacy customers that converted to the cloud and, pursuant to their related agreements with us, continued to pay license fees for growth in their employee base. Ultimate believes this campaign for Legacy to cloud conversions was successful. Since 2009, with the sunsetting of the Legacy product, effective December 31, 2014, a majority of our Legacy customers made the transition to the cloud.\nAs cloud units are sold, the recurring revenue backlog associated with UltiPro grows, enhancing the predictability of future revenue streams. Cloud revenues include ongoing monthly subscription fees, priced on a PEPM basis. Revenue recognition for our recurring revenue stream is typically triggered when the customer processes its first payroll using UltiPro (or goes Live\u201d).\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements\u201d ( ASU 2009-13\u201d). We use the relative selling price method to allocate the total consideration to units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement. We allocate revenue in an arrangement using the estimated selling price ( ESP\u201d) of deliverables if it does not have vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) or third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d) of selling price.\nVSOE is the price charged when the same or similar product or service is sold separately. We define VSOE as a median price of recent stand-alone transactions that are priced within a narrow range.\nTPE is determined based on the prices charged by our competitors for a similar deliverable when sold separately. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient information on competitor pricing and differences in our product offerings when compared with those of our peers, we generally are unable to reliably determine TPE.\nESP is our best estimate of the selling price of an element in a transaction. If we are unable to establish selling price using either VSOE or TPE, we will use ESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact business if the product or service were sold by us on a stand-alone basis. Our determination of ESP involves the use of a customary discount from the list (or book) price for each element, with the discounted price applied within a narrow range. The customary discount is derived from historical data that has been analyzed to determine trends and patterns. We analyze the customary discount used for determining ESP on no less than an annual basis.\nWe evaluate each deliverable in our arrangements to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value to our customers. Our products and services continue to qualify as separate units of accounting under ASU 2009-13.\nThere are two major elements in our multiple element arrangements for the delivery of our UltiPro offering, which are recurring revenues (i.e., cloud subscription revenues) and services revenues (mostly implementation consulting services).\nFor multiple element arrangements, the consideration allocated to cloud subscription revenues is recognized as recurring revenues over the initial contract period, as those subscription-based services are delivered, typically commencing with the Live date of the related product. The consideration allocated to fixed fee implementation consulting services in multiple element arrangements is recognized as services revenues on a percentage of completion basis, using reasonably dependable estimates with respect to milestones achieved (in relation to progression through implementation phases), by product.\nSingle element arrangements typically consist of renewals for cloud subscriptions and implementation consulting services sold on a time and materials basis. Under these single element arrangements, cloud subscription revenues are recognized over the related renewal period, as the services are delivered, and implementation consulting services are recognized as the related time and materials services are performed.\nWe recognize revenues when all of the following criteria are met:\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>delivery has occurred;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the fees are fixed and determinable; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>collection is considered probable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf collection is not considered probable, we recognize revenues when the fees are collected. If the fees are not fixed and determinable, we recognize revenues when the fees become due from the customer. If non-standard acceptance periods or non-standard performance criteria are required, we recognize revenue when the acceptance period expires or upon the satisfaction of the acceptance/performance criteria, as applicable.\nThe majority of services revenues are recognized over the implementation period, which is from the contract execution date until the Live date. Cloud revenues are recognized over the initial contract term, typically beginning in the month the customer goes Live.\nRecurring Revenues\nRecurring revenues primarily consist of subscription revenues recognized from our customers' use of UltiPro after they have gone Live.\ni) Cloud subscription revenues are principally derived from PEPM fees earned from UltiPro units that are Live. Ongoing PEPM fees are recognized as subscription revenues as the services are delivered, typically commencing when the customer goes Live.\nii) Effective January 1, 2015, we no longer have maintenance revenues associated with our Legacy customers and we stopped supporting our Legacy customers after December 31, 2014. Since the time we announced that we would stop supporting our Legacy product in 2012, we successfully converted the majority of our Legacy customers to the cloud. Those customers that did not convert terminated.\nWith UltiPro, our customers do not have the right to take possession of our software and these arrangements are considered service contracts. The selling price of multiple deliverables in cloud arrangements is derived for each element based on the guidance provided by ASU 2009-13. The multiple elements that typically exist in cloud arrangements include (1) recurring revenues from the combination of hosting services, the right to use UltiPro, and maintenance of UltiPro (i.e., product enhancements, updates and customer support) and (2) professional services (i.e., primarily implementation consulting services).\nThe pricing for the three elements that pertain to recurring revenues (i.e., hosting services, the right to use UltiPro and maintenance of UltiPro (as described above) is bundled. Since these three bundled elements are components of recurring revenues in the consolidated statements of income, allocation of selling price to each of the three elements is not necessary and they are not reported separately. Selling price, which is established through VSOE, for the bundled elements, as a whole, is determined on the basis of renewal pricing, without taking into consideration potential price increases or potential changes in the number of employees of the customer in the future due to the uncertainties surrounding these potential occurrences. These bundled elements are provided on an ongoing basis, represent undelivered elements and are recognized on a monthly basis as the related services are performed, commencing once the customer goes Live.\nServices Revenues\nServices revenues primarily include revenues from fees charged for implementation consulting services in connection with the implementation of our product solutions and, to a much lesser extent, fees for other services, including the provision of payroll-related forms, sales of time clocks and the printing of W-2 forms for certain customers, as well as certain client reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses.\nOur multiple element contracts contain recurring cloud revenues and implementation consulting services priced on a fixed fee basis. Time and materials implementation consulting services are sold as stand-alone sales not directly related to the basic implementation of the cloud product. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to services elements in the arrangement based on relative selling prices, using the prices established when the services are sold on a stand-alone basis. Selling price is established through ESP for fixed fee implementation consulting services that are included in our multiple element contracts.\nRevenues from implementation consulting services sold on a fixed-fee basis are recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method, which involves the use of estimates. Percentage of completion is measured at each reporting date based on progress made to date, using reasonably dependable estimates with respect to milestones achieved or billable hours, as applicable.\nRevenues from implementation consulting services, billed on a time and materials basis (at an hourly rate), are recognized as these services are performed. Other services are recognized as the product is shipped or as the services are rendered, depending on the specific terms of the related arrangement.\nIncome Taxes\nWe make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes.\nUltimate assesses the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax assets. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of pre-tax book income, expiration of net operating loss carryforwards, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies as well as current tax laws and interpretation of current tax laws in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If recovery is not likely, we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. The available positive evidence at December 31, 2015 included, among other factors, three years of cumulative historical pre-tax book income and a projection of future pre-tax book income and taxable income. As a result of our analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, we believe that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize all of the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. As such, there was no valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates. These judgments and estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital.\nAt December 31, 2015, our goodwill totaled $24.4 million and our identifiable net intangible assets totaled $5.2 million. We assess the impairment of goodwill of our reporting units annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit's carrying value is compared to its fair value to the extent necessary. We consider both market and discounted cash flow approaches in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results. Failure to achieve these expected results may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment tests of goodwill as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. As a result of this test, we determined that the fair value was in excess of the carrying value.\nWe evaluate our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset or group of assets. The amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. We also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe perform credit evaluations of our customers to assess their ability to make payments to us for our products and services. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on accounts receivable. A considerable amount of\njudgment is required in determining the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts, including assessing the probability of collection and current credit-worthiness of each customer. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in further impairment of their ability to make payments, an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the consolidated statements of operations data of Ultimate, as a percentage of total revenues, for the periods indicated.\nTable 72:

compared with the year ended December 31, 2014, total revenues increased by $112.2 million and our total cost of revenues and operating expenses increased by $123.2 million, resulting in our operating income decreasing by $11.0 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, our non-cash stock-based compensation expense increased $36.3 million, primarily as the result of changes we made with respect to our change in control plans for certain senior officers. As part of an on-going comprehensive review of our senior officers' compensation arrangements, during 2015, we significantly amended the CIC Plan I, which covers Mr. Scott Scherr, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Marc D. Scherr, our Vice Chairman of the Board and Chief Operating Officer, and Mr. Mitchell K. Dauerman, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, and terminated our CIC Plan II, which covered eight other senior officers of the Company (collectively, the \"CIC Plan Revisions\"). The change in control plans were designed to provide cash payments to senior officers covered by the respective plans upon a change in control\u201d of Ultimate Software. The change in control plans were originally established in 2004 in lieu of granting time-based equity awards, and they were amended in 2007 to increase the size of the control awards, again in lieu of granting time-based equity awards.Under the terms of each of the change in control plans, we were required to provide each covered senior officer with comparable value\u201d with respect to the reduction or termination of his or her change in control award. The comparable value given to each such senior officer was in the form of a restricted stock award. The grant of these restricted stock awards in connection with the CIC Plan Revisions accounted for $22.8 million of the $36.3 million increase in our non-cash stock-based compensation expense for 2015.\nAlso included in the non-cash stock-based compensation expense increase in 2015 were the effects of new grants in the year and the impact of changes in our stock price, which amounted to $10.3 million, and, to a lesser extent, a change in the vesting schedule to 3-year annual vesting for restricted stock awards granted to senior officers in the fourth quarter of 2014, from 4-year cliff vesting for restricted stock awards granted in the fourth quarter of 2013, which amounted to $2.9 million.\nOur net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $22.0 million primarily as a result of the non-cash stock-based compensation expense changes (described above), as well as a one-time income tax benefit of $12.1 million in 2014 for research and development tax credits for federal and state income tax purposes related to the tax years from 1998 through 2013.\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nRevenues\nOur revenues are primarily derived from recurring revenues and services revenues. See Revenue Recognition\u201d above for further discussion of Ultimate's revenue sources and its method of accounting for each of them.\nTotal revenues, primarily consisting of recurring and services revenues, increased 22.2% to $618.1 million for 2015 from $505.9 million for 2014.\nRecurring revenues increased 23.1% to $516.2 million for 2015 from $419.2 million for 2014. The increase in recurring revenues for 2015 was primarily due to an increase in subscription revenues from UltiPro.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The increase in cloud revenues was primarily based on the revenue impact of incremental units sold that have gone Live since December 31, 2014, including the UltiPro core product and, to a lesser extent, Optional Capabilities of UltiPro.

Those customers that did not convert terminated.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur annual revenue customer retention rate for our recurring revenue cloud customer base exceeded 97% at the end of 2015 (calculated on a 12-month rolling basis) which compares with greater than 96% for the prior year. The impact on recurring revenues of UltiPro units sold has been a gradual increase from one reporting period to the next, based on the incremental effect of revenue recognition of the subscription fees over the terms of the related contracts as sales in backlog go Live.\nServices revenues increased 18.0% to $101.7 million for 2015 from $86.2 million for 2014. The increase in services revenues for the year was primarily due to additional implementation revenues from incremental billable consultants to support increased sales, particularly from our Mid-market and Strategic sales channels and, to a lesser extent, as a result of increased fixed fee implementations.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues primarily consists of the costs of recurring and services revenues. Cost of recurring revenues primarily consists of costs to provide customer support services (\"Customer Support\") to cloud customers, the cost of providing periodic updates and other costs of recurring subscription revenues, including hosting data center costs and, to a lesser extent, amortization of capitalized software. Cost of services revenues primarily consists of costs to provide implementation services and training to Ultimate's customers and, to a lesser extent, costs related to sales of payroll-related forms, time clocks and Form W-2 services, as well as costs associated with certain client reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses.\nCost of recurring revenues increased 17.8% to $138.5 million for 2015 from $117.6 million for 2014. The $20.9 million increase in the cost of recurring revenues for the year was primarily due to increases in both cloud costs and Customer Support costs, as described below:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2015, the increases in cloud costs were principally as a result of the growth in cloud operations from increased sales, including increased labor costs and, to a lesser extent, increased variable costs associated with our cloud operations and an increase in labor costs related to UltiPro managed services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The increase in Customer Support costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to higher labor costs commensurate with the growth in the number of cloud customers serviced.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of services revenues increased 16.3% to $99.9 million for 2015 from $85.9 million for 2014. The $14.0 million increase in cost of services revenues was primarily due to an increase in the cost of implementation, including higher labor and related costs, particularly in association with the increased number of implementation consultants and, to a lesser extent, the increased use of third-party implementation partners.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, sales commissions, travel and promotional expenses, and facility and communication costs for direct sales offices, as well as advertising and marketing costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased 45.0% to $169.7 million for 2015 from $117.0 million for 2014. The $52.7 million increase in sales and marketing during 2015 was primarily due to increased labor and related costs (including the impact of an increase in sales personnel, primarily in our mid-market and strategic sales channels, and higher sales commissions) and higher advertising and marketing expenses, which included media advertising, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2015. Included in the increased labor and related costs for the 2015 year was a portion of certain non-cash, stock-based compensation expenses relating to the CIC Plan Revisions. Commissions on subscription-based cloud sales are amortized over the initial contract term (typically 24 to 36 months) typically commencing on the Live date, which corresponds with the related cloud revenue recognition.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of software development personnel costs. Research and development expenses increased 12.1% to $93.7 million in 2015 from $83.5 million in 2014. The $10.2 million increase in research and development expenses during 2015 was principally due to higher labor and related costs associated with the ongoing development of UltiPro and Optional Capabilities, including the impact of increased personnel costs (predominantly from additional headcount), net of capitalized labor costs. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we capitalized $26.3 million (including $3.0 million in non-cash stock-based compensation) and $25.2 million (including $1.7 million in non-cash stock-based compensation), respectively, of computer software development costs related to an internal-use development project for our UltiPro product offering (the \"Development Project\"). The capitalized costs for the Development Project were primarily from direct labor costs for the 2015 year. The capitalized costs for the Development Project were from direct labor costs and third party consulting fees for the 2014 year. For 2015 and 2014, we recognized $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of amortization costs which were associated with a particular product module, UltiPro Recruiting, of the Development Project which was ready for its intended use during the second quarter of 2014. The amortization of capitalized software is included in cost of recurring revenues.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of executive, administrative and financial personnel, as well as external professional fees and the provision for doubtful accounts. General and administrative expenses increased by 53.9% to $72.9 million for 2015 from $47.4 million for 2014. The $25.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses during 2015 was primarily due to higher labor and related costs, including increased personnel to support Ultimate's growth in operations, an increase in rent from additional leased space to accommodate our growth, an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts and the CIC Plan Revisions.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIn 2015, based on pre-tax income, we had income tax expense of $20.4 million as compared to $9.6 million in 2014. The increase in income tax expense of $10.8 million was primarily due to the excess of the benefit recorded in 2014 for research and development activities of $14.4 million related to the tax years 1998-2014 over the benefit recorded in 2015 of $3.2 million, primarily related to the tax year 2015. A decrease in pre-tax book income and an increase in non-deductible expenses also effected the year over year income tax expense. Ultimate recorded $13.2 million and $2.3 million of research and development tax credit carryforwards during the quarters ended September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Ultimate recorded $0.6 million and $2.6 million of research and development tax credit carryforwards during the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively.\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nRevenues\nTotal revenues, primarily consisting of recurring and services revenues, increased 23.3% to $505.9 million for 2014 from $410.4 million for 2013.\nRecurring revenues increased 25.4% to $419.2 million for 2014 from $334.4 million for 2013. The increase in recurring revenues for 2014 was primarily due to an increase in cloud revenues, partially offset by a decrease in maintenance revenues. After we discontinued selling perpetual licenses in 2009, we began the process of converting our on-premise customers to the cloud. In 2012, we formally announced to our on-premise (or \"Legacy\") customers that we would cease supporting our Legacy product after December 31, 2014. Therefore, beginning in 2012, we strengthened our conversion program for our Legacy customers. Since 2009, we believe our conversion program was successful in transitioning the majority of our Legacy customers to the cloud. During 2014, our cloud revenues increased primarily as a result of new customers who went Live on UltiPro and the related Optional Capabilities of UltiPro during the year and, to a lesser extent, the conversion of Legacy customers to the cloud. As a result of the conversion program, maintenance revenues from Legacy customers continued to decrease over the course of 2014 and stopped after December 31, 2014. Our annual revenue customer retention rate for total recurring revenue cloud customer base exceeded 96% in 2014. The impact on recurring revenues of units sold under the cloud offering has been a gradual increase from one reporting period to the next, based on the incremental effect of revenue recognition of the subscription fees over the terms of the related contracts as sales in backlog go Live.\nServices revenues increased 14.7% to $86.2 million for 2014 from $75.1 million for 2013 primarily as a result of an increase in implementation revenues. The increase in implementation revenues was primarily attributable to a combination of more billable consultants and the increased utilization of seasoned consultants and, to a lesser extent, the increased use of third-party implementation partners. The increased implementation revenues occurred as a result of increased fixed fee implementations as well as increased time and materials implementation services.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues primarily consists of the costs of recurring and services revenues. Cost of recurring revenues primarily consists of costs to provide customer support services (\"Customer Support\") to cloud customers, the cost of providing periodic updates and the cost of recurring subscription revenues, including hosting data center costs and, to a lesser extent, amortization of capitalized software. Cost of services revenues primarily consists of costs to provide implementation services and training to Ultimate's customers.\nCost of recurring revenues increased 28.0% to $117.6 million for 2014 from $91.9 million for 2013. The $25.7 million increase in the cost of recurring revenues for the year was primarily due to increases in both cloud costs and customer support and product update costs. The increase in cloud costs was principally as a result of the growth in cloud operations and increased sales, including increased labor costs (which includes increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense). Non\nlabor-related hosting data center costs increased slightly when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in customer support and maintenance costs was primarily due to higher labor costs commensurate with the growth in the number of customers serviced.\nCost of services revenues increased 12.2% to $85.9 million for 2014 from $76.6 million for 2013. The $9.4 million increase in cost of services revenues was primarily due to an increase in the cost of implementation, which was primarily due to higher labor and related costs (including non-cash stock-based compensation), particularly in association with an increased number of implementation consultants and, to a lesser extent, the increased use of third-party implementation partners.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, sales commissions, travel and promotional expenses, and facility and communication costs for direct sales offices, as well as advertising and marketing costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased 24.7% to $117.0 million for 2014 from $93.9 million for 2013. The $23.2 million increase in sales and marketing during 2014 was primarily due to increased labor and related costs (including additional personnel costs, increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense and, to a lesser extent, higher sales commissions), as well as increased advertising and marketing costs. Commissions on cloud sales are amortized over the initial contract term (typically 24 to 36 months) commencing on the Live date, which corresponds with the related cloud revenue recognition.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of software development personnel costs. Research and development expenses increased 23.3% to $83.5 million in 2014 from $67.8 million in 2013. The $15.8 million increase in research and development expenses during 2014 was principally due to higher labor and related costs (which include increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense) attributable to the ongoing development of UltiPro and Optional Capabilities, including the impact of increased personnel costs (predominantly from additional headcount), partially offset by capitalized labor costs and capitalized third-party consulting costs. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we capitalized $25.2 million and $19.0 million, respectively, of computer software development costs related to the Development Project. The increase in capitalized research and development costs in 2014 was attributable to the increase in both the internal labor being capitalized and the increased use of third-party consultants working on the development project.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of executive, administrative and financial personnel, as well as external professional fees and the provision for doubtful accounts. General and administrative expenses increased by 28.5% to $47.4 million for 2014 from $36.9 million for 2013. The $10.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses for 2014 was primarily due to increased labor and related costs (which includes the impact of additional personnel costs as well as increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense), partially offset by a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts and a decrease in professional fees.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIn 2014, based on pre-tax income, we had income tax expense of $9.6 million as compared to $17.6 million in 2013. The decrease in income tax expense of $8.0 million was primarily due to a benefit recorded for research and development activities of $14.4 million related to the tax years 1998-2014. This benefit was partially offset by an increase in pre-tax book income and an increase in non-deductible expenses. Ultimate recorded $13.2 million and $2.3 million of research and development tax credit carryforwards during the quarters ended September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. In management's opinion, this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the quarters presented. This information should be read in conjunction with Ultimate's Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future. Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, increased expenses (especially as they relate to product development, sales and marketing and the use of third-party\nconsultants), timing of product releases, increased competition, variations in the mix of revenues, announcements of new products by us or our competitors and capital spending patterns of our customers. We establish our expenditure levels based upon our expectations as to future revenues, and, if revenue levels are below expectations, expenses can be disproportionately high. A drop in near term demand for our products could significantly affect both revenues and profits in any quarter. Operating results achieved in previous fiscal quarters are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the full fiscal years or for any future periods. As a result of these factors, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly basis. We believe that, due to the underlying factors for quarterly fluctuations, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of Ultimate's operations are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

financial condition may be affected by such trends in the future. Ultimate's quarterly revenues and operating results\nhave varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future. Revenues have historically increased at higher rates in the fourth quarter of the year and at lower rates in the next succeeding quarter. We believe such seasonality is due to a number of factors, including our quota-based compensation arrangements, typical of those used in software companies, and year-end budgetary pressures on our customers. We believe that the seasonal trend that Ultimate has experienced in the past may continue in the foreseeable future.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn recent years, we have funded operations primarily from cash flows generated from operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $129.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments in marketable securities, reflecting a net increase of $10.9 million since December 31, 2014. Cash and cash equivalents and corporate investments in marketable securities accounted for $1.0 million and $9.9 million, respectively, of the total increase. The total increase was primarily due to cash provided by operations of $142.7 million (excluding the non-cash impact of the excess tax benefit from stock option exercises) and proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock from employee and non-employee director stock option exercises of $4.7 million, partially offset by cash purchases of property and equipment (including principal payments on financed equipment) of $55.4 million (which includes $23.3 million of capitalized labor costs, paid in cash, associated with the Development Project), cash of $43.1 million used for the repurchases of shares of Common Stock under our previously announced stock repurchase plan (\"Stock Repurchase Plan\"), cash used to settle employee tax withholding liabilities for vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units of $35.0 million, the effect of the exchange rate on cash of $2.4 million, and, to a lesser extent, net payments on borrowings of $0.6 million.\nOur operating cash inflows primarily consist of payments received from our UltiPro customers. Our operating cash outflows primarily consist of cash we invest in personnel and infrastructure to support the anticipated growth of our business, payments to vendors related to our services, payments under arrangements with third party vendors who provide hosting infrastructure services in connection with UltiPro, related sales and marketing costs, costs of operations and systems development and programming costs and, from time to time, payments for acquisitions. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $30.3 million during 2015 as compared with 2014. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operating income, after adjusting for the impact of non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and expense associated with stock-based compensation awards, partially offset by increased accounts receivable and increased cash paid for working capital, including prepaid commissions in association with increased sales.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $224.8 million for 2015 as compared with $535.2 million for 2014. The $310.4 million decrease from 2014 was primarily attributable to a decrease of $402.6 million in client funds received from our customers using the UltiPro payment services offering ( UltiPro Payment Services\u201d) and an increase in maturities of marketable securities of $1.3 million, partially offset by an increase in the purchases of marketable securities of $81.2 million (which includes $70.0 million of funds held for customers being invested in marketable securities in addition to our corporate funds), and an increase in cash purchases of property and equipment of $12.5 million (including an increase of $1.1 million of capitalized labor costs, paid in cash, associated with the Development Project). Beginning in December 2015, we began investing our customer funds in available for sale securities in addition to our corporate funds in accordance with our internal investment strategies. The portfolio predominantly consists of investment grade securities with long-term ratings of AAA and AA+ and short-term ratings A-1/P-1. Customer funds not invested in available for sale securities, temporarily held by us as a result of our UltiPro Payment Services, are invested in U.S. Government money market funds that invest in short-term, high quality money market instruments which consist of U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government Agency obligations and repurchase agreements collateralized by such obligations. The money market funds are rated AAA by Standard & Poor's and Aaa by Moody's. Any residual customer funds are held primarily in our bank accounts.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $117.3 million for 2015 as compared with $483.9 million for 2014. The $366.6 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to a decrease of $332.6 million in UltiPro Payment Services client fund obligations, a $23.2 million increase in cash used for the repurchases of shares of Common Stock under our Stock Repurchase Plan, an increase of $15.1 million in cash used to settle employee tax withholding liabilities for the vesting of restricted stock, and lower proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock from employee and non-employee director stock option exercises of $1.5 million, partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits from stock option exercises of $4.4 million and a decrease in net payments on other borrowings of $2.1 million.\nDays sales outstanding ( DSO\u201d), calculated on a trailing three-month basis, as of December 31, 2015 were 70 days as compared with 68 days as of December 31, 2014. The increase of two days was associated with stronger sales bookings at the end of 2015.\nDeferred revenues were $145.7 million at December 31, 2015, as compared with $109.7 million at December 31, 2014. The increase of $36.0 million in deferred revenues for 2015 was primarily due to higher deferred cloud revenues mainly attributable to increased sales.\nUltimate believes that cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. This belief is based upon, among other factors, management's expectations for future revenue growth, controlled expenses and collections of accounts receivable.\nWe did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2015.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not, and, as of December 31, 2015, we did not, have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in applicable SEC rules) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nItem 10 (e) of Regulation S-K, \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,\" defines and prescribes the use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measure of Non-GAAP Operating Income, which excludes non-cash stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles, meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.\nUltimate believes that this non-GAAP measure of financial results provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Ultimate's financial condition and results of operations. Ultimate's management uses this non-GAAP result to compare Ultimate's performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, for purposes of determining executive incentive compensation, and for budget and planning purposes. This measure is used in monthly financial reports prepared for management and in quarterly financial reports presented to Ultimate's Board of Directors. This measure may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nThis non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to such measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The principal limitation of this non-GAAP financial measure is that it excludes significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded. In addition, it is subject to inherent limitations as it reflects the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measure.\nTo compensate for these limitations, Ultimate presents its non-GAAP financial measure in connection with its GAAP result. Ultimate strongly urges investors and potential investors in Ultimate's securities to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measure to the comparable GAAP financial measure that is included in the table below and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business.\nWe exclude the following items from the non-GAAP financial measure, Non-GAAP Operating Income, as appropriate:\nStock-based compensation expense. Ultimate's non-GAAP financial measure of Non-GAAP Operating Income excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which consists of expenses for restricted stock and stock unit awards recorded in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\u201d For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, stock-based compensation expense was $82.4 million, $46.2 million and $32.8 million, respectively, on a pre-tax basis. Stock-based compensation expense is excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures because it is a non-cash expense that Ultimate does not consider part of ongoing operations when assessing its financial performance. Ultimate believes that such exclusion facilitates the comparison of results of ongoing operations for current and future periods with such results from past periods. For GAAP net income periods, non-GAAP reconciliations are calculated on a diluted weighted average share basis.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets. In accordance with GAAP, operating expenses include amortization of acquired intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of such assets. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the amortization of acquired intangible assets was $1.0 million, $1.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded from Ultimate's non-GAAP financial measures because it is a non-cash expense that Ultimate does not consider part of ongoing operations when assessing its financial performance. Ultimate believes that such\nexclusion facilitates comparisons to its historical operating results and to the results of other companies in the same industry, which have their own unique acquisition histories.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP operating income reconciliation:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income, as a % of total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash amortization of acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>242\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP operating income, as a % of total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2015, Ultimate's outstanding contractual cash obligations were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term obligations (2)\n</td> <td>59,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities (3)\n</td> <td>5,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>We lease certain computer equipment under non-cancelable agreements, which are accounted for as capital leases and expire at various dates through 2018.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides information we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes that are included in this Form 10-K. Also, the discussion of Critical Accounting Estimates in this section is an integral part of the analysis of our results of operations and financial condition.\nBusiness Overview\nUltimate Software is a leading cloud provider of people management solutions, often referred to as human capital management ( HCM\u201d). Ultimate's UltiPro product suite ( UltiPro\u201d) is a comprehensive, engaging solution that has human resources (\"HR\"), payroll, and benefits management at its core and includes global people management, available in twelve languages with more than 35 country-specific localizations. The solution is delivered primarily via software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") to organizations based in the United States and Canada, including those with global workforces. At the close of 2015, we had approximately 3,200 organizations as customers and more than 25 million people records in our HCM cloud. We attained our leadership position, we believe, through our focus on unified HCM, people-centric product design, cloud technology, and strong customer relationships.\nUltiPro is designed to deliver the functionality businesses need to manage the complete employee life cycle from recruitment to retirement and to facilitate employee engagement with their employers and each other. The solution includes unified feature sets for talent acquisition and onboarding, HR management and compliance, benefits management and online enrollment, payroll, performance management, compensation management with salary planning, budgeting and development of incentive plans, succession management, reporting and analytical decision-making and predictive tools, and time and attendance. UltiPro has role-based features for HR professionals, executives, managers, administrators, and employees whether they are in or out of the office, including access to business-critical information on mobile devices such as the iPhone, iPad, and other smartphones and tablets.\nOur customers tell us that UltiPro helps them to streamline talent management, HR and payroll processes to significantly reduce administrative and operational costs while also empowering them to manage the talent in their workforces more strategically. UltiPro provides our customers with tools to analyze workforce trends for better decision making, identify high-performing talent within their organizations, predict who high-performers will be with a high degree of accuracy, find critical information quickly and perform routine business activities efficiently.\nOur cloud offering of UltiPro provides Web-based access to comprehensive HCM functionality for organizations that want to simplify delivery and support of their business applications. We have found that UltiPro is attractive to companies that want to focus on their core competencies to increase sales and profits. Through UltiPro, we supply and manage the hardware, infrastructure, ongoing maintenance and backup services for our customers. Customer systems are currently managed at four data centers--one located near Atlanta, Georgia, one near Phoenix, Arizona, one near Toronto, Canada, and another near Vancouver, Canada. All data centers are owned and operated by independent third parties.\nWe market our UltiPro solutions primarily to enterprise companies, which we define as companies with more than 1,500 employees, including those with 10,000 or more employees; mid-market companies, which we define as those having approximately 500-1,500 employees; and strategic companies, which we define as having approximately 100-499 employees. Our mid-market and strategic customers have access to nearly all the features that our larger enterprise companies have through UltiPro, plus a bundled services package. Since many companies in the mid- and strategic markets do not have information technology ( IT\u201d) staff on their premises to help with system deployment or ongoing management issues, we have created a bundled services package to give these customers a high degree of convenience by handling system configuration, business rules, and other situations for them behind the scenes.\u201d UltiPro is marketed primarily through our enterprise, mid-market and strategic direct sales teams.\nIn addition to UltiPro's HCM functionality, our customers have the option to purchase a number of additional capabilities on a per-employee-per-month ( PEPM\u201d) basis, which are available to enhance and complement the functionality of UltiPro and which are based on the particular business needs of our customers. These optional UltiPro capabilities currently include (i) the talent acquisition suite (recruitment and onboarding); (ii) the talent management suite (performance management, talent predictors, and succession management); (iii) compensation management; (iv) benefits enrollment; (v) time management; (vi) Select Services which include payment services (formerly referred to as tax filing\u201d), managed services and other specific-need services such as filing Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") compliance documents for customers; (vii) wage attachments; and (viii) other optional features (collectively, Optional Capabilities\u201d).\nIn the fall of 2015, Ultimate began deploying an ACA toolkit that enables our customers to comply with ACA regulations by the 2016 deadline. The toolkit is embedded in UltiPro and automatically populates the Forms 1094-C and 1095-C with the appropriate information. In addition, Ultimate offers our customers additional optional ACA-related services, branded UltiPro ACA Employer Services. These include such services as printing and electronic filing of 1094-C and 1095-C forms to the IRS on our customer's behalf and on-going proactive monitoring and managing of employee eligibility alerts, notices, and penalty responses. UltiPro's tracking of hours worked in payroll ties to UltiPro's benefits management, enabling automatic calculation of employees' hours of service eligibility and providing HR leaders analytical insight into compliance risk related to the ACA delivered in the Healthcare Eligibility Dashboard and via our UltiPro ACA Toolkit.\nAll Optional Capabilities are priced solely on a subscription basis. Some of the Optional Capabilities are available to enterprise, mid-market and strategic customers while others are available exclusively to either enterprise, mid-market or strategic customers, and availability is based on the needs of the respective customers, the number of their employees and the complexity of their HCM environment.\nThe key drivers of our business are (i) growth in recurring revenues; (ii) operating income, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles (\"Non-GAAP Operating Income\"); and (iii) retention of our customers once our solutions are sold ( Customer Retention\u201d). For the year ended December 31, 2015, our (i) recurring revenues grew by 23.1%, compared with the same period in 2014, and (ii) Non-GAAP Operating Income was $126.8 million, or 20.5% of total revenues, as compared with $101.7 million, or 20.1% of total revenues, for the same period in 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our (i) recurring revenues grew by 25.4%, compared with the same period in 2013 and (ii) Non-GAAP Operating Income was $101.7 million, or 20.1% of total revenues, as compared with $76.3 million, or 18.6% of total revenues, for the same period in 2013. As of December 31, 2015, our Customer Retention, on a trailing twelve-month basis, exceeded 97% for our recurring revenue cloud customer base, which compares with greater than 96% for the prior year. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nOur ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend upon the success of our direct sales force and our ability to adapt our sales efforts to address the evolving markets for our products and services. We provide our sales personnel with comprehensive and continuing training with respect to technology and market place developments. Aside from sales commissions, we also provide various incentives to encourage our sales representatives, including stock-based compensation awards based upon performance.\nThe HCM market is intensely competitive. We address competitive pressures through improvements and enhancements to our products and services, the development of additional features of UltiPro and a comprehensive marketing team and process that distinguishes Ultimate and its products from the competition. Our focus on customer service, which enables us to maintain a high Customer Retention rate, also helps us address competitive pressures.\nAs our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions. If general economic conditions were to deteriorate, we may experience delays in our sales cycles, increased pressure from prospective customers to offer discounts and increased pressure from existing customers to renew expiring recurring revenue agreements for lower amounts. We address continuing economic pressures by, among other things, efforts to control growth of our operating expenses through the monitoring of controllable costs and vendor negotiations.\nUltimate has two primary revenue sources: recurring revenues and services revenues. Prior to December 31, 2014, subscription revenues from UltiPro and maintenance revenues were the primary components of recurring revenues. Effective January 1, 2015, the primary component of recurring revenues is subscription revenues from UltiPro for the reasons discussed below. The majority of services revenues are derived from implementation consulting services.\nSubsequent to the discontinuation of selling perpetual licenses of UltiPro to new customers, which occurred in 2009, we sold licenses to existing license customers but only in relation to the customer's employee growth or for Optional Capabilities if the customer already had a perpetual license for the on-site UltiPro solutions. As perpetual license agreements were sold in the past, annual maintenance contracts (priced as a percentage of the related license fee) accompanied those agreements. Maintenance contracts typically had a one-year term with annual renewal periods thereafter. Since 2009 and through December 31, 2014, our maintenance revenues were related to renewal maintenance only. In 2012, we announced that we would no longer support the licensed UltiPro (\"Legacy\") products after December 31, 2014. In the approximate two-year period after the announcement, Ultimate strengthened its campaign to convert Legacy customers to cloud customers. Effective January 1, 2015, we no longer have maintenance revenues associated with our Legacy customers. The small amount of license revenues reflected in the three months ended March 31, 2015, in the Quarterly Results of Operations below, was primarily\nrelated to certain Legacy customers that converted to the cloud and, pursuant to their related agreements with us, continued to pay license fees for growth in their employee base. Ultimate believes this campaign for Legacy to cloud conversions was successful. Since 2009, with the sunsetting of the Legacy product, effective December 31, 2014, a majority of our Legacy customers made the transition to the cloud.\nAs cloud units are sold, the recurring revenue backlog associated with UltiPro grows, enhancing the predictability of future revenue streams. Cloud revenues include ongoing monthly subscription fees, priced on a PEPM basis. Revenue recognition for our recurring revenue stream is typically triggered when the customer processes its first payroll using UltiPro (or goes Live\u201d).\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements\u201d ( ASU 2009-13\u201d). We use the relative selling price method to allocate the total consideration to units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement. We allocate revenue in an arrangement using the estimated selling price ( ESP\u201d) of deliverables if it does not have vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) or third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d) of selling price.\nVSOE is the price charged when the same or similar product or service is sold separately. We define VSOE as a median price of recent stand-alone transactions that are priced within a narrow range.\nTPE is determined based on the prices charged by our competitors for a similar deliverable when sold separately. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient information on competitor pricing and differences in our product offerings when compared with those of our peers, we generally are unable to reliably determine TPE.\nESP is our best estimate of the selling price of an element in a transaction. If we are unable to establish selling price using either VSOE or TPE, we will use ESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact business if the product or service were sold by us on a stand-alone basis. Our determination of ESP involves the use of a customary discount from the list (or book) price for each element, with the discounted price applied within a narrow range. The customary discount is derived from historical data that has been analyzed to determine trends and patterns. We analyze the customary discount used for determining ESP on no less than an annual basis.\nWe evaluate each deliverable in our arrangements to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value to our customers. Our products and services continue to qualify as separate units of accounting under ASU 2009-13.\nThere are two major elements in our multiple element arrangements for the delivery of our UltiPro offering, which are recurring revenues (i.e., cloud subscription revenues) and services revenues (mostly implementation consulting services).\nFor multiple element arrangements, the consideration allocated to cloud subscription revenues is recognized as recurring revenues over the initial contract period, as those subscription-based services are delivered, typically commencing with the Live date of the related product. The consideration allocated to fixed fee implementation consulting services in multiple element arrangements is recognized as services revenues on a percentage of completion basis, using reasonably dependable estimates with respect to milestones achieved (in relation to progression through implementation phases), by product.\nSingle element arrangements typically consist of renewals for cloud subscriptions and implementation consulting services sold on a time and materials basis. Under these single element arrangements, cloud subscription revenues are recognized over the related renewal period, as the services are delivered, and implementation consulting services are recognized as the related time and materials services are performed.\nWe recognize revenues when all of the following criteria are met:\n \u2022 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; \n \u2022 delivery has occurred; \n \u2022 the fees are fixed and determinable; and \n \u2022 collection is considered probable. \nIf collection is not considered probable, we recognize revenues when the fees are collected. If the fees are not fixed and determinable, we recognize revenues when the fees become due from the customer. If non-standard acceptance periods or non-standard performance criteria are required, we recognize revenue when the acceptance period expires or upon the satisfaction of the acceptance/performance criteria, as applicable.\nThe majority of services revenues are recognized over the implementation period, which is from the contract execution date until the Live date. Cloud revenues are recognized over the initial contract term, typically beginning in the month the customer goes Live.\nRecurring Revenues\nRecurring revenues primarily consist of subscription revenues recognized from our customers' use of UltiPro after they have gone Live.\ni) Cloud subscription revenues are principally derived from PEPM fees earned from UltiPro units that are Live. Ongoing PEPM fees are recognized as subscription revenues as the services are delivered, typically commencing when the customer goes Live.\nii) Effective January 1, 2015, we no longer have maintenance revenues associated with our Legacy customers and we stopped supporting our Legacy customers after December 31, 2014. Since the time we announced that we would stop supporting our Legacy product in 2012, we successfully converted the majority of our Legacy customers to the cloud. Those customers that did not convert terminated.\nWith UltiPro, our customers do not have the right to take possession of our software and these arrangements are considered service contracts. The selling price of multiple deliverables in cloud arrangements is derived for each element based on the guidance provided by ASU 2009-13. The multiple elements that typically exist in cloud arrangements include (1) recurring revenues from the combination of hosting services, the right to use UltiPro, and maintenance of UltiPro (i.e., product enhancements, updates and customer support) and (2) professional services (i.e., primarily implementation consulting services).\nThe pricing for the three elements that pertain to recurring revenues (i.e., hosting services, the right to use UltiPro and maintenance of UltiPro (as described above) is bundled. Since these three bundled elements are components of recurring revenues in the consolidated statements of income, allocation of selling price to each of the three elements is not necessary and they are not reported separately. Selling price, which is established through VSOE, for the bundled elements, as a whole, is determined on the basis of renewal pricing, without taking into consideration potential price increases or potential changes in the number of employees of the customer in the future due to the uncertainties surrounding these potential occurrences. These bundled elements are provided on an ongoing basis, represent undelivered elements and are recognized on a monthly basis as the related services are performed, commencing once the customer goes Live.\nServices Revenues\nServices revenues primarily include revenues from fees charged for implementation consulting services in connection with the implementation of our product solutions and, to a much lesser extent, fees for other services, including the provision of payroll-related forms, sales of time clocks and the printing of W-2 forms for certain customers, as well as certain client reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses.\nOur multiple element contracts contain recurring cloud revenues and implementation consulting services priced on a fixed fee basis. Time and materials implementation consulting services are sold as stand-alone sales not directly related to the basic implementation of the cloud product. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to services elements in the arrangement based on relative selling prices, using the prices established when the services are sold on a stand-alone basis. Selling price is established through ESP for fixed fee implementation consulting services that are included in our multiple element contracts.\nRevenues from implementation consulting services sold on a fixed-fee basis are recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method, which involves the use of estimates. Percentage of completion is measured at each reporting date based on progress made to date, using reasonably dependable estimates with respect to milestones achieved or billable hours, as applicable.\nRevenues from implementation consulting services, billed on a time and materials basis (at an hourly rate), are recognized as these services are performed. Other services are recognized as the product is shipped or as the services are rendered, depending on the specific terms of the related arrangement.\nIncome Taxes\nWe make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes.\nUltimate assesses the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax assets. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of pre-tax book income, expiration of net operating loss carryforwards, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies as well as current tax laws and interpretation of current tax laws in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If recovery is not likely, we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. The available positive evidence at December 31, 2015 included, among other factors, three years of cumulative historical pre-tax book income and a projection of future pre-tax book income and taxable income. As a result of our analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, we believe that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize all of the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. As such, there was no valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates. These judgments and estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital.\nAt December 31, 2015, our goodwill totaled $24.4 million and our identifiable net intangible assets totaled $5.2 million. We assess the impairment of goodwill of our reporting units annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit's carrying value is compared to its fair value to the extent necessary. We consider both market and discounted cash flow approaches in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results. Failure to achieve these expected results may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment tests of goodwill as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. As a result of this test, we determined that the fair value was in excess of the carrying value.\nWe evaluate our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset or group of assets. The amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. We also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe perform credit evaluations of our customers to assess their ability to make payments to us for our products and services. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on accounts receivable. A considerable amount of\njudgment is required in determining the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts, including assessing the probability of collection and current credit-worthiness of each customer. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in further impairment of their ability to make payments, an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the consolidated statements of operations data of Ultimate, as a percentage of total revenues, for the periods indicated.\n\nThe following table sets forth the non-cash stock-based compensation expense resulting from stock-based arrangements that is recorded in our consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nOverview of Financial Results\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with the year ended December 31, 2014, total revenues increased by $112.2 million and our total cost of revenues and operating expenses increased by $123.2 million, resulting in our operating income decreasing by $11.0 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, our non-cash stock-based compensation expense increased $36.3 million, primarily as the result of changes we made with respect to our change in control plans for certain senior officers. As part of an on-going comprehensive review of our senior officers' compensation arrangements, during 2015, we significantly amended the CIC Plan I, which covers Mr. Scott Scherr, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Marc D. Scherr, our Vice Chairman of the Board and Chief Operating Officer, and Mr. Mitchell K. Dauerman, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, and terminated our CIC Plan II, which covered eight other senior officers of the Company (collectively, the \"CIC Plan Revisions\"). The change in control plans were designed to provide cash payments to senior officers covered by the respective plans upon a change in control\u201d of Ultimate Software. The change in control plans were originally established in 2004 in lieu of granting time-based equity awards, and they were amended in 2007 to increase the size of the control awards, again in lieu of granting time-based equity awards.Under the terms of each of the change in control plans, we were required to provide each covered senior officer with comparable value\u201d with respect to the reduction or termination of his or her change in control award. The comparable value given to each such senior officer was in the form of a restricted stock award. The grant of these restricted stock awards in connection with the CIC Plan Revisions accounted for $22.8 million of the $36.3 million increase in our non-cash stock-based compensation expense for 2015.\nAlso included in the non-cash stock-based compensation expense increase in 2015 were the effects of new grants in the year and the impact of changes in our stock price, which amounted to $10.3 million, and, to a lesser extent, a change in the vesting schedule to 3-year annual vesting for restricted stock awards granted to senior officers in the fourth quarter of 2014, from 4-year cliff vesting for restricted stock awards granted in the fourth quarter of 2013, which amounted to $2.9 million.\nOur net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $22.0 million primarily as a result of the non-cash stock-based compensation expense changes (described above), as well as a one-time income tax benefit of $12.1 million in 2014 for research and development tax credits for federal and state income tax purposes related to the tax years from 1998 through 2013.\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nRevenues\nOur revenues are primarily derived from recurring revenues and services revenues. See Revenue Recognition\u201d above for further discussion of Ultimate's revenue sources and its method of accounting for each of them.\nTotal revenues, primarily consisting of recurring and services revenues, increased 22.2% to $618.1 million for 2015 from $505.9 million for 2014.\nRecurring revenues increased 23.1% to $516.2 million for 2015 from $419.2 million for 2014. The increase in recurring revenues for 2015 was primarily due to an increase in subscription revenues from UltiPro.\n \u2022 The increase in cloud revenues was primarily based on the revenue impact of incremental units sold that have gone Live since December 31, 2014, including the UltiPro core product and, to a lesser extent, Optional Capabilities of UltiPro. Cloud subscription revenues are recognized as recurring revenues over the initial contract period, as those services are delivered, typically commencing with the Live date. \n \u2022 Effective January 1, 2015, we no longer have maintenance revenues associated with our Legacy customers. Since the time we announced that we would stop supporting our Legacy product in 2012, we successfully converted the majority of our Legacy customers to the cloud. Those customers that did not convert terminated. \nOur annual revenue customer retention rate for our recurring revenue cloud customer base exceeded 97% at the end of 2015 (calculated on a 12-month rolling basis) which compares with greater than 96% for the prior year. The impact on recurring revenues of UltiPro units sold has been a gradual increase from one reporting period to the next, based on the incremental effect of revenue recognition of the subscription fees over the terms of the related contracts as sales in backlog go Live.\nServices revenues increased 18.0% to $101.7 million for 2015 from $86.2 million for 2014. The increase in services revenues for the year was primarily due to additional implementation revenues from incremental billable consultants to support increased sales, particularly from our Mid-market and Strategic sales channels and, to a lesser extent, as a result of increased fixed fee implementations.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues primarily consists of the costs of recurring and services revenues. Cost of recurring revenues primarily consists of costs to provide customer support services (\"Customer Support\") to cloud customers, the cost of providing periodic updates and other costs of recurring subscription revenues, including hosting data center costs and, to a lesser extent, amortization of capitalized software. Cost of services revenues primarily consists of costs to provide implementation services and training to Ultimate's customers and, to a lesser extent, costs related to sales of payroll-related forms, time clocks and Form W-2 services, as well as costs associated with certain client reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses.\nCost of recurring revenues increased 17.8% to $138.5 million for 2015 from $117.6 million for 2014. The $20.9 million increase in the cost of recurring revenues for the year was primarily due to increases in both cloud costs and Customer Support costs, as described below:\n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2015, the increases in cloud costs were principally as a result of the growth in cloud operations from increased sales, including increased labor costs and, to a lesser extent, increased variable costs associated with our cloud operations and an increase in labor costs related to UltiPro managed services. \n \u2022 The increase in Customer Support costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to higher labor costs commensurate with the growth in the number of cloud customers serviced. \nCost of services revenues increased 16.3% to $99.9 million for 2015 from $85.9 million for 2014. The $14.0 million increase in cost of services revenues was primarily due to an increase in the cost of implementation, including higher labor and related costs, particularly in association with the increased number of implementation consultants and, to a lesser extent, the increased use of third-party implementation partners.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, sales commissions, travel and promotional expenses, and facility and communication costs for direct sales offices, as well as advertising and marketing costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased 45.0% to $169.7 million for 2015 from $117.0 million for 2014. The $52.7 million increase in sales and marketing during 2015 was primarily due to increased labor and related costs (including the impact of an increase in sales personnel, primarily in our mid-market and strategic sales channels, and higher sales commissions) and higher advertising and marketing expenses, which included media advertising, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2015. Included in the increased labor and related costs for the 2015 year was a portion of certain non-cash, stock-based compensation expenses relating to the CIC Plan Revisions. Commissions on subscription-based cloud sales are amortized over the initial contract term (typically 24 to 36 months) typically commencing on the Live date, which corresponds with the related cloud revenue recognition.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of software development personnel costs. Research and development expenses increased 12.1% to $93.7 million in 2015 from $83.5 million in 2014. The $10.2 million increase in research and development expenses during 2015 was principally due to higher labor and related costs associated with the ongoing development of UltiPro and Optional Capabilities, including the impact of increased personnel costs (predominantly from additional headcount), net of capitalized labor costs. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we capitalized $26.3 million (including $3.0 million in non-cash stock-based compensation) and $25.2 million (including $1.7 million in non-cash stock-based compensation), respectively, of computer software development costs related to an internal-use development project for our UltiPro product offering (the \"Development Project\"). The capitalized costs for the Development Project were primarily from direct labor costs for the 2015 year. The capitalized costs for the Development Project were from direct labor costs and third party consulting fees for the 2014 year. For 2015 and 2014, we recognized $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of amortization costs which were associated with a particular product module, UltiPro Recruiting, of the Development Project which was ready for its intended use during the second quarter of 2014. The amortization of capitalized software is included in cost of recurring revenues.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of executive, administrative and financial personnel, as well as external professional fees and the provision for doubtful accounts. General and administrative expenses increased by 53.9% to $72.9 million for 2015 from $47.4 million for 2014. The $25.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses during 2015 was primarily due to higher labor and related costs, including increased personnel to support Ultimate's growth in operations, an increase in rent from additional leased space to accommodate our growth, an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts and the CIC Plan Revisions.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIn 2015, based on pre-tax income, we had income tax expense of $20.4 million as compared to $9.6 million in 2014. The increase in income tax expense of $10.8 million was primarily due to the excess of the benefit recorded in 2014 for research and development activities of $14.4 million related to the tax years 1998-2014 over the benefit recorded in 2015 of $3.2 million, primarily related to the tax year 2015. A decrease in pre-tax book income and an increase in non-deductible expenses also effected the year over year income tax expense. Ultimate recorded $13.2 million and $2.3 million of research and development tax credit carryforwards during the quarters ended September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Ultimate recorded $0.6 million and $2.6 million of research and development tax credit carryforwards during the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively.\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nRevenues\nTotal revenues, primarily consisting of recurring and services revenues, increased 23.3% to $505.9 million for 2014 from $410.4 million for 2013.\nRecurring revenues increased 25.4% to $419.2 million for 2014 from $334.4 million for 2013. The increase in recurring revenues for 2014 was primarily due to an increase in cloud revenues, partially offset by a decrease in maintenance revenues. After we discontinued selling perpetual licenses in 2009, we began the process of converting our on-premise customers to the cloud. In 2012, we formally announced to our on-premise (or \"Legacy\") customers that we would cease supporting our Legacy product after December 31, 2014. Therefore, beginning in 2012, we strengthened our conversion program for our Legacy customers. Since 2009, we believe our conversion program was successful in transitioning the majority of our Legacy customers to the cloud. During 2014, our cloud revenues increased primarily as a result of new customers who went Live on UltiPro and the related Optional Capabilities of UltiPro during the year and, to a lesser extent, the conversion of Legacy customers to the cloud. As a result of the conversion program, maintenance revenues from Legacy customers continued to decrease over the course of 2014 and stopped after December 31, 2014. Our annual revenue customer retention rate for total recurring revenue cloud customer base exceeded 96% in 2014. The impact on recurring revenues of units sold under the cloud offering has been a gradual increase from one reporting period to the next, based on the incremental effect of revenue recognition of the subscription fees over the terms of the related contracts as sales in backlog go Live.\nServices revenues increased 14.7% to $86.2 million for 2014 from $75.1 million for 2013 primarily as a result of an increase in implementation revenues. The increase in implementation revenues was primarily attributable to a combination of more billable consultants and the increased utilization of seasoned consultants and, to a lesser extent, the increased use of third-party implementation partners. The increased implementation revenues occurred as a result of increased fixed fee implementations as well as increased time and materials implementation services.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues primarily consists of the costs of recurring and services revenues. Cost of recurring revenues primarily consists of costs to provide customer support services (\"Customer Support\") to cloud customers, the cost of providing periodic updates and the cost of recurring subscription revenues, including hosting data center costs and, to a lesser extent, amortization of capitalized software. Cost of services revenues primarily consists of costs to provide implementation services and training to Ultimate's customers.\nCost of recurring revenues increased 28.0% to $117.6 million for 2014 from $91.9 million for 2013. The $25.7 million increase in the cost of recurring revenues for the year was primarily due to increases in both cloud costs and customer support and product update costs. The increase in cloud costs was principally as a result of the growth in cloud operations and increased sales, including increased labor costs (which includes increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense). Non\nlabor-related hosting data center costs increased slightly when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in customer support and maintenance costs was primarily due to higher labor costs commensurate with the growth in the number of customers serviced.\nCost of services revenues increased 12.2% to $85.9 million for 2014 from $76.6 million for 2013. The $9.4 million increase in cost of services revenues was primarily due to an increase in the cost of implementation, which was primarily due to higher labor and related costs (including non-cash stock-based compensation), particularly in association with an increased number of implementation consultants and, to a lesser extent, the increased use of third-party implementation partners.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, sales commissions, travel and promotional expenses, and facility and communication costs for direct sales offices, as well as advertising and marketing costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased 24.7% to $117.0 million for 2014 from $93.9 million for 2013. The $23.2 million increase in sales and marketing during 2014 was primarily due to increased labor and related costs (including additional personnel costs, increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense and, to a lesser extent, higher sales commissions), as well as increased advertising and marketing costs. Commissions on cloud sales are amortized over the initial contract term (typically 24 to 36 months) commencing on the Live date, which corresponds with the related cloud revenue recognition.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of software development personnel costs. Research and development expenses increased 23.3% to $83.5 million in 2014 from $67.8 million in 2013. The $15.8 million increase in research and development expenses during 2014 was principally due to higher labor and related costs (which include increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense) attributable to the ongoing development of UltiPro and Optional Capabilities, including the impact of increased personnel costs (predominantly from additional headcount), partially offset by capitalized labor costs and capitalized third-party consulting costs. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we capitalized $25.2 million and $19.0 million, respectively, of computer software development costs related to the Development Project. The increase in capitalized research and development costs in 2014 was attributable to the increase in both the internal labor being capitalized and the increased use of third-party consultants working on the development project.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of executive, administrative and financial personnel, as well as external professional fees and the provision for doubtful accounts. General and administrative expenses increased by 28.5% to $47.4 million for 2014 from $36.9 million for 2013. The $10.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses for 2014 was primarily due to increased labor and related costs (which includes the impact of additional personnel costs as well as increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense), partially offset by a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts and a decrease in professional fees.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIn 2014, based on pre-tax income, we had income tax expense of $9.6 million as compared to $17.6 million in 2013. The decrease in income tax expense of $8.0 million was primarily due to a benefit recorded for research and development activities of $14.4 million related to the tax years 1998-2014. This benefit was partially offset by an increase in pre-tax book income and an increase in non-deductible expenses. Ultimate recorded $13.2 million and $2.3 million of research and development tax credit carryforwards during the quarters ended September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. In management's opinion, this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the quarters presented. This information should be read in conjunction with Ultimate's Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future. Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, increased expenses (especially as they relate to product development, sales and marketing and the use of third-party\nconsultants), timing of product releases, increased competition, variations in the mix of revenues, announcements of new products by us or our competitors and capital spending patterns of our customers. We establish our expenditure levels based upon our expectations as to future revenues, and, if revenue levels are below expectations, expenses can be disproportionately high. A drop in near term demand for our products could significantly affect both revenues and profits in any quarter. Operating results achieved in previous fiscal quarters are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the full fiscal years or for any future periods. As a result of these factors, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly basis. We believe that, due to the underlying factors for quarterly fluctuations, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of Ultimate's operations are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.\n\nSeasonality\nWe have experienced, and may experience in the future, seasonality in our business, and our business, operating results and financial condition may be affected by such trends in the future. Ultimate's quarterly revenues and operating results\nhave varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future. Revenues have historically increased at higher rates in the fourth quarter of the year and at lower rates in the next succeeding quarter. We believe such seasonality is due to a number of factors, including our quota-based compensation arrangements, typical of those used in software companies, and year-end budgetary pressures on our customers. We believe that the seasonal trend that Ultimate has experienced in the past may continue in the foreseeable future.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn recent years, we have funded operations primarily from cash flows generated from operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $129.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments in marketable securities, reflecting a net increase of $10.9 million since December 31, 2014. Cash and cash equivalents and corporate investments in marketable securities accounted for $1.0 million and $9.9 million, respectively, of the total increase. The total increase was primarily due to cash provided by operations of $142.7 million (excluding the non-cash impact of the excess tax benefit from stock option exercises) and proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock from employee and non-employee director stock option exercises of $4.7 million, partially offset by cash purchases of property and equipment (including principal payments on financed equipment) of $55.4 million (which includes $23.3 million of capitalized labor costs, paid in cash, associated with the Development Project), cash of $43.1 million used for the repurchases of shares of Common Stock under our previously announced stock repurchase plan (\"Stock Repurchase Plan\"), cash used to settle employee tax withholding liabilities for vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units of $35.0 million, the effect of the exchange rate on cash of $2.4 million, and, to a lesser extent, net payments on borrowings of $0.6 million.\nOur operating cash inflows primarily consist of payments received from our UltiPro customers. Our operating cash outflows primarily consist of cash we invest in personnel and infrastructure to support the anticipated growth of our business, payments to vendors related to our services, payments under arrangements with third party vendors who provide hosting infrastructure services in connection with UltiPro, related sales and marketing costs, costs of operations and systems development and programming costs and, from time to time, payments for acquisitions. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $30.3 million during 2015 as compared with 2014. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operating income, after adjusting for the impact of non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and expense associated with stock-based compensation awards, partially offset by increased accounts receivable and increased cash paid for working capital, including prepaid commissions in association with increased sales.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $224.8 million for 2015 as compared with $535.2 million for 2014. The $310.4 million decrease from 2014 was primarily attributable to a decrease of $402.6 million in client funds received from our customers using the UltiPro payment services offering ( UltiPro Payment Services\u201d) and an increase in maturities of marketable securities of $1.3 million, partially offset by an increase in the purchases of marketable securities of $81.2 million (which includes $70.0 million of funds held for customers being invested in marketable securities in addition to our corporate funds), and an increase in cash purchases of property and equipment of $12.5 million (including an increase of $1.1 million of capitalized labor costs, paid in cash, associated with the Development Project). Beginning in December 2015, we began investing our customer funds in available for sale securities in addition to our corporate funds in accordance with our internal investment strategies. The portfolio predominantly consists of investment grade securities with long-term ratings of AAA and AA+ and short-term ratings A-1/P-1. Customer funds not invested in available for sale securities, temporarily held by us as a result of our UltiPro Payment Services, are invested in U.S. Government money market funds that invest in short-term, high quality money market instruments which consist of U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government Agency obligations and repurchase agreements collateralized by such obligations. The money market funds are rated AAA by Standard & Poor's and Aaa by Moody's. Any residual customer funds are held primarily in our bank accounts.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $117.3 million for 2015 as compared with $483.9 million for 2014. The $366.6 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to a decrease of $332.6 million in UltiPro Payment Services client fund obligations, a $23.2 million increase in cash used for the repurchases of shares of Common Stock under our Stock Repurchase Plan, an increase of $15.1 million in cash used to settle employee tax withholding liabilities for the vesting of restricted stock, and lower proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock from employee and non-employee director stock option exercises of $1.5 million, partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits from stock option exercises of $4.4 million and a decrease in net payments on other borrowings of $2.1 million.\nDays sales outstanding ( DSO\u201d), calculated on a trailing three-month basis, as of December 31, 2015 were 70 days as compared with 68 days as of December 31, 2014. The increase of two days was associated with stronger sales bookings at the end of 2015.\nDeferred revenues were $145.7 million at December 31, 2015, as compared with $109.7 million at December 31, 2014. The increase of $36.0 million in deferred revenues for 2015 was primarily due to higher deferred cloud revenues mainly attributable to increased sales.\nUltimate believes that cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. This belief is based upon, among other factors, management's expectations for future revenue growth, controlled expenses and collections of accounts receivable.\nWe did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2015.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not, and, as of December 31, 2015, we did not, have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in applicable SEC rules) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nItem 10 (e) of Regulation S-K, \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,\" defines and prescribes the use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measure of Non-GAAP Operating Income, which excludes non-cash stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles, meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.\nUltimate believes that this non-GAAP measure of financial results provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Ultimate's financial condition and results of operations. Ultimate's management uses this non-GAAP result to compare Ultimate's performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, for purposes of determining executive incentive compensation, and for budget and planning purposes. This measure is used in monthly financial reports prepared for management and in quarterly financial reports presented to Ultimate's Board of Directors. This measure may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nThis non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to such measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The principal limitation of this non-GAAP financial measure is that it excludes significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded. In addition, it is subject to inherent limitations as it reflects the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measure.\nTo compensate for these limitations, Ultimate presents its non-GAAP financial measure in connection with its GAAP result. Ultimate strongly urges investors and potential investors in Ultimate's securities to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measure to the comparable GAAP financial measure that is included in the table below and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business.\nWe exclude the following items from the non-GAAP financial measure, Non-GAAP Operating Income, as appropriate:\nStock-based compensation expense. Ultimate's non-GAAP financial measure of Non-GAAP Operating Income excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which consists of expenses for restricted stock and stock unit awards recorded in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\u201d For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, stock-based compensation expense was $82.4 million, $46.2 million and $32.8 million, respectively, on a pre-tax basis. Stock-based compensation expense is excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures because it is a non-cash expense that Ultimate does not consider part of ongoing operations when assessing its financial performance. Ultimate believes that such exclusion facilitates the comparison of results of ongoing operations for current and future periods with such results from past periods. For GAAP net income periods, non-GAAP reconciliations are calculated on a diluted weighted average share basis.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets. In accordance with GAAP, operating expenses include amortization of acquired intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of such assets. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the amortization of acquired intangible assets was $1.0 million, $1.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded from Ultimate's non-GAAP financial measures because it is a non-cash expense that Ultimate does not consider part of ongoing operations when assessing its financial performance. Ultimate believes that such\nexclusion facilitates comparisons to its historical operating results and to the results of other companies in the same industry, which have their own unique acquisition histories.\n For the Year", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides information we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes that are included in this Form 10-K. Also, the discussion of Critical Accounting Estimates in this section is an integral part of the analysis of our results of operations and financial condition.\nBusiness Overview\nUltimate Software is a leading cloud provider of people management solutions, often referred to as human capital management ( HCM\u201d). Ultimate's UltiPro product suite ( UltiPro\u201d) is a comprehensive, engaging solution that has human resources (\"HR\"), payroll, and benefits management at its core and includes global people management, available in twelve languages with more than 35 country-specific localizations. The solution is delivered primarily via software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") to organizations based in the United States and Canada, including those with global workforces. At the close of 2015, we had approximately 3,200 organizations as customers and more than 25 million people records in our HCM cloud. We attained our leadership position, we believe, through our focus on unified HCM, people-centric product design, cloud technology, and strong customer relationships.\nUltiPro is designed to deliver the functionality businesses need to manage the complete employee life cycle from recruitment to retirement and to facilitate employee engagement with their employers and each other. The solution includes unified feature sets for talent acquisition and onboarding, HR management and compliance, benefits management and online enrollment, payroll, performance management, compensation management with salary planning, budgeting and development of incentive plans, succession management, reporting and analytical decision-making and predictive tools, and time and attendance. UltiPro has role-based features for HR professionals, executives, managers, administrators, and employees whether they are in or out of the office, including access to business-critical information on mobile devices such as the iPhone, iPad, and other smartphones and tablets.\nOur customers tell us that UltiPro helps them to streamline talent management, HR and payroll processes to significantly reduce administrative and operational costs while also empowering them to manage the talent in their workforces more strategically. UltiPro provides our customers with tools to analyze workforce trends for better decision making, identify high-performing talent within their organizations, predict who high-performers will be with a high degree of accuracy, find critical information quickly and perform routine business activities efficiently.\nOur cloud offering of UltiPro provides Web-based access to comprehensive HCM functionality for organizations that want to simplify delivery and support of their business applications. We have found that UltiPro is attractive to companies that want to focus on their core competencies to increase sales and profits. Through UltiPro, we supply and manage the hardware, infrastructure, ongoing maintenance and backup services for our customers. Customer systems are currently managed at four data centers--one located near Atlanta, Georgia, one near Phoenix, Arizona, one near Toronto, Canada, and another near Vancouver, Canada. All data centers are owned and operated by independent third parties.\nWe market our UltiPro solutions primarily to enterprise companies, which we define as companies with more than 1,500 employees, including those with 10,000 or more employees; mid-market companies, which we define as those having approximately 500-1,500 employees; and strategic companies, which we define as having approximately 100-499 employees. Our mid-market and strategic customers have access to nearly all the features that our larger enterprise companies have through UltiPro, plus a bundled services package. Since many companies in the mid- and strategic markets do not have information technology ( IT\u201d) staff on their premises to help with system deployment or ongoing management issues, we have created a bundled services package to give these customers a high degree of convenience by handling system configuration, business rules, and other situations for them behind the scenes.\u201d UltiPro is marketed primarily through our enterprise, mid-market and strategic direct sales teams.\nIn addition to UltiPro's HCM functionality, our customers have the option to purchase a number of additional capabilities on a per-employee-per-month ( PEPM\u201d) basis, which are available to enhance and complement the functionality of UltiPro and which are based on the particular business needs of our customers. These optional UltiPro capabilities currently include (i) the talent acquisition suite (recruitment and onboarding); (ii) the talent management suite (performance management, talent predictors, and succession management); (iii) compensation management; (iv) benefits enrollment; (v) time management; (vi) Select Services which include payment services (formerly referred to as tax filing\u201d), managed services and other specific-need services such as filing Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") compliance documents for customers; (vii) wage attachments; and (viii) other optional features (collectively, Optional Capabilities\u201d).\nIn the fall of 2015, Ultimate began deploying an ACA toolkit that enables our customers to comply with ACA regulations by the 2016 deadline. The toolkit is embedded in UltiPro and automatically populates the Forms 1094-C and 1095-C with the appropriate information. In addition, Ultimate offers our customers additional optional ACA-related services, branded UltiPro ACA Employer Services. These include such services as printing and electronic filing of 1094-C and 1095-C forms to the IRS on our customer's behalf and on-going proactive monitoring and managing of employee eligibility alerts, notices, and penalty responses. UltiPro's tracking of hours worked in payroll ties to UltiPro's benefits management, enabling automatic calculation of employees' hours of service eligibility and providing HR leaders analytical insight into compliance risk related to the ACA delivered in the Healthcare Eligibility Dashboard and via our UltiPro ACA Toolkit.\nAll Optional Capabilities are priced solely on a subscription basis. Some of the Optional Capabilities are available to enterprise, mid-market and strategic customers while others are available exclusively to either enterprise, mid-market or strategic customers, and availability is based on the needs of the respective customers, the number of their employees and the complexity of their HCM environment.\nThe key drivers of our business are (i) growth in recurring revenues; (ii) operating income, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles (\"Non-GAAP Operating Income\"); and (iii) retention of our customers once our solutions are sold ( Customer Retention\u201d). For the year ended December 31, 2015, our (i) recurring revenues grew by 23.1%, compared with the same period in 2014, and (ii) Non-GAAP Operating Income was $126.8 million, or 20.5% of total revenues, as compared with $101.7 million, or 20.1% of total revenues, for the same period in 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our (i) recurring revenues grew by 25.4%, compared with the same period in 2013 and (ii) Non-GAAP Operating Income was $101.7 million, or 20.1% of total revenues, as compared with $76.3 million, or 18.6% of total revenues, for the same period in 2013. As of December 31, 2015, our Customer Retention, on a trailing twelve-month basis, exceeded 97% for our recurring revenue cloud customer base, which compares with greater than 96% for the prior year. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nOur ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend upon the success of our direct sales force and our ability to adapt our sales efforts to address the evolving markets for our products and services. We provide our sales personnel with comprehensive and continuing training with respect to technology and market place developments. Aside from sales commissions, we also provide various incentives to encourage our sales representatives, including stock-based compensation awards based upon performance.\nThe HCM market is intensely competitive. We address competitive pressures through improvements and enhancements to our products and services, the development of additional features of UltiPro and a comprehensive marketing team and process that distinguishes Ultimate and its products from the competition. Our focus on customer service, which enables us to maintain a high Customer Retention rate, also helps us address competitive pressures.\nAs our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions. If general economic conditions were to deteriorate, we may experience delays in our sales cycles, increased pressure from prospective customers to offer discounts and increased pressure from existing customers to renew expiring recurring revenue agreements for lower amounts. We address continuing economic pressures by, among other things, efforts to control growth of our operating expenses through the monitoring of controllable costs and vendor negotiations.\nUltimate has two primary revenue sources: recurring revenues and services revenues. Prior to December 31, 2014, subscription revenues from UltiPro and maintenance revenues were the primary components of recurring revenues. Effective January 1, 2015, the primary component of recurring revenues is subscription revenues from UltiPro for the reasons discussed below. The majority of services revenues are derived from implementation consulting services.\nSubsequent to the discontinuation of selling perpetual licenses of UltiPro to new customers, which occurred in 2009, we sold licenses to existing license customers but only in relation to the customer's employee growth or for Optional Capabilities if the customer already had a perpetual license for the on-site UltiPro solutions. As perpetual license agreements were sold in the past, annual maintenance contracts (priced as a percentage of the related license fee) accompanied those agreements. Maintenance contracts typically had a one-year term with annual renewal periods thereafter. Since 2009 and through December 31, 2014, our maintenance revenues were related to renewal maintenance only. In 2012, we announced that we would no longer support the licensed UltiPro (\"Legacy\") products after December 31, 2014. In the approximate two-year period after the announcement, Ultimate strengthened its campaign to convert Legacy customers to cloud customers. Effective January 1, 2015, we no longer have maintenance revenues associated with our Legacy customers. The small amount of license revenues reflected in the three months ended March 31, 2015, in the Quarterly Results of Operations below, was primarily\nrelated to certain Legacy customers that converted to the cloud and, pursuant to their related agreements with us, continued to pay license fees for growth in their employee base. Ultimate believes this campaign for Legacy to cloud conversions was successful. Since 2009, with the sunsetting of the Legacy product, effective December 31, 2014, a majority of our Legacy customers made the transition to the cloud.\nAs cloud units are sold, the recurring revenue backlog associated with UltiPro grows, enhancing the predictability of future revenue streams. Cloud revenues include ongoing monthly subscription fees, priced on a PEPM basis. Revenue recognition for our recurring revenue stream is typically triggered when the customer processes its first payroll using UltiPro (or goes Live\u201d).\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements\u201d ( ASU 2009-13\u201d). We use the relative selling price method to allocate the total consideration to units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement. We allocate revenue in an arrangement using the estimated selling price ( ESP\u201d) of deliverables if it does not have vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) or third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d) of selling price.\nVSOE is the price charged when the same or similar product or service is sold separately. We define VSOE as a median price of recent stand-alone transactions that are priced within a narrow range.\nTPE is determined based on the prices charged by our competitors for a similar deliverable when sold separately. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient information on competitor pricing and differences in our product offerings when compared with those of our peers, we generally are unable to reliably determine TPE.\nESP is our best estimate of the selling price of an element in a transaction. If we are unable to establish selling price using either VSOE or TPE, we will use ESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact business if the product or service were sold by us on a stand-alone basis. Our determination of ESP involves the use of a customary discount from the list (or book) price for each element, with the discounted price applied within a narrow range. The customary discount is derived from historical data that has been analyzed to determine trends and patterns. We analyze the customary discount used for determining ESP on no less than an annual basis.\nWe evaluate each deliverable in our arrangements to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value to our customers. Our products and services continue to qualify as separate units of accounting under ASU 2009-13.\nThere are two major elements in our multiple element arrangements for the delivery of our UltiPro offering, which are recurring revenues (i.e., cloud subscription revenues) and services revenues (mostly implementation consulting services).\nFor multiple element arrangements, the consideration allocated to cloud subscription revenues is recognized as recurring revenues over the initial contract period, as those subscription-based services are delivered, typically commencing with the Live date of the related product. The consideration allocated to fixed fee implementation consulting services in multiple element arrangements is recognized as services revenues on a percentage of completion basis, using reasonably dependable estimates with respect to milestones achieved (in relation to progression through implementation phases), by product.\nSingle element arrangements typically consist of renewals for cloud subscriptions and implementation consulting services sold on a time and materials basis. Under these single element arrangements, cloud subscription revenues are recognized over the related renewal period, as the services are delivered, and implementation consulting services are recognized as the related time and materials services are performed.\nWe recognize revenues when all of the following criteria are met:\n \u2022 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; \n \u2022 delivery has occurred; \n \u2022 the fees are fixed and determinable; and \n \u2022 collection is considered probable. \nIf collection is not considered probable, we recognize revenues when the fees are collected. If the fees are not fixed and determinable, we recognize revenues when the fees become due from the customer. If non-standard acceptance periods or non-standard performance criteria are required, we recognize revenue when the acceptance period expires or upon the satisfaction of the acceptance/performance criteria, as applicable.\nThe majority of services revenues are recognized over the implementation period, which is from the contract execution date until the Live date. Cloud revenues are recognized over the initial contract term, typically beginning in the month the customer goes Live.\nRecurring Revenues\nRecurring revenues primarily consist of subscription revenues recognized from our customers' use of UltiPro after they have gone Live.\ni) Cloud subscription revenues are principally derived from PEPM fees earned from UltiPro units that are Live. Ongoing PEPM fees are recognized as subscription revenues as the services are delivered, typically commencing when the customer goes Live.\nii) Effective January 1, 2015, we no longer have maintenance revenues associated with our Legacy customers and we stopped supporting our Legacy customers after December 31, 2014. Since the time we announced that we would stop supporting our Legacy product in 2012, we successfully converted the majority of our Legacy customers to the cloud. Those customers that did not convert terminated.\nWith UltiPro, our customers do not have the right to take possession of our software and these arrangements are considered service contracts. The selling price of multiple deliverables in cloud arrangements is derived for each element based on the guidance provided by ASU 2009-13. The multiple elements that typically exist in cloud arrangements include (1) recurring revenues from the combination of hosting services, the right to use UltiPro, and maintenance of UltiPro (i.e., product enhancements, updates and customer support) and (2) professional services (i.e., primarily implementation consulting services).\nThe pricing for the three elements that pertain to recurring revenues (i.e., hosting services, the right to use UltiPro and maintenance of UltiPro (as described above) is bundled. Since these three bundled elements are components of recurring revenues in the consolidated statements of income, allocation of selling price to each of the three elements is not necessary and they are not reported separately. Selling price, which is established through VSOE, for the bundled elements, as a whole, is determined on the basis of renewal pricing, without taking into consideration potential price increases or potential changes in the number of employees of the customer in the future due to the uncertainties surrounding these potential occurrences. These bundled elements are provided on an ongoing basis, represent undelivered elements and are recognized on a monthly basis as the related services are performed, commencing once the customer goes Live.\nServices Revenues\nServices revenues primarily include revenues from fees charged for implementation consulting services in connection with the implementation of our product solutions and, to a much lesser extent, fees for other services, including the provision of payroll-related forms, sales of time clocks and the printing of W-2 forms for certain customers, as well as certain client reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses.\nOur multiple element contracts contain recurring cloud revenues and implementation consulting services priced on a fixed fee basis. Time and materials implementation consulting services are sold as stand-alone sales not directly related to the basic implementation of the cloud product. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to services elements in the arrangement based on relative selling prices, using the prices established when the services are sold on a stand-alone basis. Selling price is established through ESP for fixed fee implementation consulting services that are included in our multiple element contracts.\nRevenues from implementation consulting services sold on a fixed-fee basis are recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method, which involves the use of estimates. Percentage of completion is measured at each reporting date based on progress made to date, using reasonably dependable estimates with respect to milestones achieved or billable hours, as applicable.\nRevenues from implementation consulting services, billed on a time and materials basis (at an hourly rate), are recognized as these services are performed. Other services are recognized as the product is shipped or as the services are rendered, depending on the specific terms of the related arrangement.\nIncome Taxes\nWe make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes.\nUltimate assesses the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax assets. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of pre-tax book income, expiration of net operating loss carryforwards, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies as well as current tax laws and interpretation of current tax laws in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If recovery is not likely, we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. The available positive evidence at December 31, 2015 included, among other factors, three years of cumulative historical pre-tax book income and a projection of future pre-tax book income and taxable income. As a result of our analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, we believe that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize all of the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. As such, there was no valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates. These judgments and estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital.\nAt December 31, 2015, our goodwill totaled $24.4 million and our identifiable net intangible assets totaled $5.2 million. We assess the impairment of goodwill of our reporting units annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit's carrying value is compared to its fair value to the extent necessary. We consider both market and discounted cash flow approaches in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results. Failure to achieve these expected results may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment tests of goodwill as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. As a result of this test, we determined that the fair value was in excess of the carrying value.\nWe evaluate our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset or group of assets. The amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. We also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe perform credit evaluations of our customers to assess their ability to make payments to us for our products and services. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on accounts receivable. A considerable amount of\njudgment is required in determining the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts, including assessing the probability of collection and current credit-worthiness of each customer. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in further impairment of their ability to make payments, an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the consolidated statements of operations data of Ultimate, as a percentage of total revenues, for the periods indicated.\nTable 72:

compared with the year ended December 31, 2014, total revenues increased by $112.2 million and our total cost of revenues and operating expenses increased by $123.2 million, resulting in our operating income decreasing by $11.0 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, our non-cash stock-based compensation expense increased $36.3 million, primarily as the result of changes we made with respect to our change in control plans for certain senior officers. As part of an on-going comprehensive review of our senior officers' compensation arrangements, during 2015, we significantly amended the CIC Plan I, which covers Mr. Scott Scherr, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Marc D. Scherr, our Vice Chairman of the Board and Chief Operating Officer, and Mr. Mitchell K. Dauerman, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, and terminated our CIC Plan II, which covered eight other senior officers of the Company (collectively, the \"CIC Plan Revisions\"). The change in control plans were designed to provide cash payments to senior officers covered by the respective plans upon a change in control\u201d of Ultimate Software. The change in control plans were originally established in 2004 in lieu of granting time-based equity awards, and they were amended in 2007 to increase the size of the control awards, again in lieu of granting time-based equity awards.Under the terms of each of the change in control plans, we were required to provide each covered senior officer with comparable value\u201d with respect to the reduction or termination of his or her change in control award. The comparable value given to each such senior officer was in the form of a restricted stock award. The grant of these restricted stock awards in connection with the CIC Plan Revisions accounted for $22.8 million of the $36.3 million increase in our non-cash stock-based compensation expense for 2015.\nAlso included in the non-cash stock-based compensation expense increase in 2015 were the effects of new grants in the year and the impact of changes in our stock price, which amounted to $10.3 million, and, to a lesser extent, a change in the vesting schedule to 3-year annual vesting for restricted stock awards granted to senior officers in the fourth quarter of 2014, from 4-year cliff vesting for restricted stock awards granted in the fourth quarter of 2013, which amounted to $2.9 million.\nOur net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $22.0 million primarily as a result of the non-cash stock-based compensation expense changes (described above), as well as a one-time income tax benefit of $12.1 million in 2014 for research and development tax credits for federal and state income tax purposes related to the tax years from 1998 through 2013.\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nRevenues\nOur revenues are primarily derived from recurring revenues and services revenues. See Revenue Recognition\u201d above for further discussion of Ultimate's revenue sources and its method of accounting for each of them.\nTotal revenues, primarily consisting of recurring and services revenues, increased 22.2% to $618.1 million for 2015 from $505.9 million for 2014.\nRecurring revenues increased 23.1% to $516.2 million for 2015 from $419.2 million for 2014. The increase in recurring revenues for 2015 was primarily due to an increase in subscription revenues from UltiPro.\n \u2022 The increase in cloud revenues was primarily based on the revenue impact of incremental units sold that have gone Live since December 31, 2014, including the UltiPro core product and, to a lesser extent, Optional Capabilities of UltiPro. Cloud subscription revenues are recognized as recurring revenues over the initial contract period, as those services are delivered, typically commencing with the Live date. \n \u2022 Effective January 1, 2015, we no longer have maintenance revenues associated with our Legacy customers. Since the time we announced that we would stop supporting our Legacy product in 2012, we successfully converted the majority of our Legacy customers to the cloud. Those customers that did not convert terminated. \nOur annual revenue customer retention rate for our recurring revenue cloud customer base exceeded 97% at the end of 2015 (calculated on a 12-month rolling basis) which compares with greater than 96% for the prior year. The impact on recurring revenues of UltiPro units sold has been a gradual increase from one reporting period to the next, based on the incremental effect of revenue recognition of the subscription fees over the terms of the related contracts as sales in backlog go Live.\nServices revenues increased 18.0% to $101.7 million for 2015 from $86.2 million for 2014. The increase in services revenues for the year was primarily due to additional implementation revenues from incremental billable consultants to support increased sales, particularly from our Mid-market and Strategic sales channels and, to a lesser extent, as a result of increased fixed fee implementations.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues primarily consists of the costs of recurring and services revenues. Cost of recurring revenues primarily consists of costs to provide customer support services (\"Customer Support\") to cloud customers, the cost of providing periodic updates and other costs of recurring subscription revenues, including hosting data center costs and, to a lesser extent, amortization of capitalized software. Cost of services revenues primarily consists of costs to provide implementation services and training to Ultimate's customers and, to a lesser extent, costs related to sales of payroll-related forms, time clocks and Form W-2 services, as well as costs associated with certain client reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses.\nCost of recurring revenues increased 17.8% to $138.5 million for 2015 from $117.6 million for 2014. The $20.9 million increase in the cost of recurring revenues for the year was primarily due to increases in both cloud costs and Customer Support costs, as described below:\n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2015, the increases in cloud costs were principally as a result of the growth in cloud operations from increased sales, including increased labor costs and, to a lesser extent, increased variable costs associated with our cloud operations and an increase in labor costs related to UltiPro managed services. \n \u2022 The increase in Customer Support costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to higher labor costs commensurate with the growth in the number of cloud customers serviced. \nCost of services revenues increased 16.3% to $99.9 million for 2015 from $85.9 million for 2014. The $14.0 million increase in cost of services revenues was primarily due to an increase in the cost of implementation, including higher labor and related costs, particularly in association with the increased number of implementation consultants and, to a lesser extent, the increased use of third-party implementation partners.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, sales commissions, travel and promotional expenses, and facility and communication costs for direct sales offices, as well as advertising and marketing costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased 45.0% to $169.7 million for 2015 from $117.0 million for 2014. The $52.7 million increase in sales and marketing during 2015 was primarily due to increased labor and related costs (including the impact of an increase in sales personnel, primarily in our mid-market and strategic sales channels, and higher sales commissions) and higher advertising and marketing expenses, which included media advertising, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2015. Included in the increased labor and related costs for the 2015 year was a portion of certain non-cash, stock-based compensation expenses relating to the CIC Plan Revisions. Commissions on subscription-based cloud sales are amortized over the initial contract term (typically 24 to 36 months) typically commencing on the Live date, which corresponds with the related cloud revenue recognition.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of software development personnel costs. Research and development expenses increased 12.1% to $93.7 million in 2015 from $83.5 million in 2014. The $10.2 million increase in research and development expenses during 2015 was principally due to higher labor and related costs associated with the ongoing development of UltiPro and Optional Capabilities, including the impact of increased personnel costs (predominantly from additional headcount), net of capitalized labor costs. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we capitalized $26.3 million (including $3.0 million in non-cash stock-based compensation) and $25.2 million (including $1.7 million in non-cash stock-based compensation), respectively, of computer software development costs related to an internal-use development project for our UltiPro product offering (the \"Development Project\"). The capitalized costs for the Development Project were primarily from direct labor costs for the 2015 year. The capitalized costs for the Development Project were from direct labor costs and third party consulting fees for the 2014 year. For 2015 and 2014, we recognized $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of amortization costs which were associated with a particular product module, UltiPro Recruiting, of the Development Project which was ready for its intended use during the second quarter of 2014. The amortization of capitalized software is included in cost of recurring revenues.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of executive, administrative and financial personnel, as well as external professional fees and the provision for doubtful accounts. General and administrative expenses increased by 53.9% to $72.9 million for 2015 from $47.4 million for 2014. The $25.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses during 2015 was primarily due to higher labor and related costs, including increased personnel to support Ultimate's growth in operations, an increase in rent from additional leased space to accommodate our growth, an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts and the CIC Plan Revisions.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIn 2015, based on pre-tax income, we had income tax expense of $20.4 million as compared to $9.6 million in 2014. The increase in income tax expense of $10.8 million was primarily due to the excess of the benefit recorded in 2014 for research and development activities of $14.4 million related to the tax years 1998-2014 over the benefit recorded in 2015 of $3.2 million, primarily related to the tax year 2015. A decrease in pre-tax book income and an increase in non-deductible expenses also effected the year over year income tax expense. Ultimate recorded $13.2 million and $2.3 million of research and development tax credit carryforwards during the quarters ended September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Ultimate recorded $0.6 million and $2.6 million of research and development tax credit carryforwards during the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively.\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nRevenues\nTotal revenues, primarily consisting of recurring and services revenues, increased 23.3% to $505.9 million for 2014 from $410.4 million for 2013.\nRecurring revenues increased 25.4% to $419.2 million for 2014 from $334.4 million for 2013. The increase in recurring revenues for 2014 was primarily due to an increase in cloud revenues, partially offset by a decrease in maintenance revenues. After we discontinued selling perpetual licenses in 2009, we began the process of converting our on-premise customers to the cloud. In 2012, we formally announced to our on-premise (or \"Legacy\") customers that we would cease supporting our Legacy product after December 31, 2014. Therefore, beginning in 2012, we strengthened our conversion program for our Legacy customers. Since 2009, we believe our conversion program was successful in transitioning the majority of our Legacy customers to the cloud. During 2014, our cloud revenues increased primarily as a result of new customers who went Live on UltiPro and the related Optional Capabilities of UltiPro during the year and, to a lesser extent, the conversion of Legacy customers to the cloud. As a result of the conversion program, maintenance revenues from Legacy customers continued to decrease over the course of 2014 and stopped after December 31, 2014. Our annual revenue customer retention rate for total recurring revenue cloud customer base exceeded 96% in 2014. The impact on recurring revenues of units sold under the cloud offering has been a gradual increase from one reporting period to the next, based on the incremental effect of revenue recognition of the subscription fees over the terms of the related contracts as sales in backlog go Live.\nServices revenues increased 14.7% to $86.2 million for 2014 from $75.1 million for 2013 primarily as a result of an increase in implementation revenues. The increase in implementation revenues was primarily attributable to a combination of more billable consultants and the increased utilization of seasoned consultants and, to a lesser extent, the increased use of third-party implementation partners. The increased implementation revenues occurred as a result of increased fixed fee implementations as well as increased time and materials implementation services.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues primarily consists of the costs of recurring and services revenues. Cost of recurring revenues primarily consists of costs to provide customer support services (\"Customer Support\") to cloud customers, the cost of providing periodic updates and the cost of recurring subscription revenues, including hosting data center costs and, to a lesser extent, amortization of capitalized software. Cost of services revenues primarily consists of costs to provide implementation services and training to Ultimate's customers.\nCost of recurring revenues increased 28.0% to $117.6 million for 2014 from $91.9 million for 2013. The $25.7 million increase in the cost of recurring revenues for the year was primarily due to increases in both cloud costs and customer support and product update costs. The increase in cloud costs was principally as a result of the growth in cloud operations and increased sales, including increased labor costs (which includes increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense). Non\nlabor-related hosting data center costs increased slightly when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in customer support and maintenance costs was primarily due to higher labor costs commensurate with the growth in the number of customers serviced.\nCost of services revenues increased 12.2% to $85.9 million for 2014 from $76.6 million for 2013. The $9.4 million increase in cost of services revenues was primarily due to an increase in the cost of implementation, which was primarily due to higher labor and related costs (including non-cash stock-based compensation), particularly in association with an increased number of implementation consultants and, to a lesser extent, the increased use of third-party implementation partners.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, sales commissions, travel and promotional expenses, and facility and communication costs for direct sales offices, as well as advertising and marketing costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased 24.7% to $117.0 million for 2014 from $93.9 million for 2013. The $23.2 million increase in sales and marketing during 2014 was primarily due to increased labor and related costs (including additional personnel costs, increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense and, to a lesser extent, higher sales commissions), as well as increased advertising and marketing costs. Commissions on cloud sales are amortized over the initial contract term (typically 24 to 36 months) commencing on the Live date, which corresponds with the related cloud revenue recognition.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of software development personnel costs. Research and development expenses increased 23.3% to $83.5 million in 2014 from $67.8 million in 2013. The $15.8 million increase in research and development expenses during 2014 was principally due to higher labor and related costs (which include increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense) attributable to the ongoing development of UltiPro and Optional Capabilities, including the impact of increased personnel costs (predominantly from additional headcount), partially offset by capitalized labor costs and capitalized third-party consulting costs. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we capitalized $25.2 million and $19.0 million, respectively, of computer software development costs related to the Development Project. The increase in capitalized research and development costs in 2014 was attributable to the increase in both the internal labor being capitalized and the increased use of third-party consultants working on the development project.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of executive, administrative and financial personnel, as well as external professional fees and the provision for doubtful accounts. General and administrative expenses increased by 28.5% to $47.4 million for 2014 from $36.9 million for 2013. The $10.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses for 2014 was primarily due to increased labor and related costs (which includes the impact of additional personnel costs as well as increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense), partially offset by a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts and a decrease in professional fees.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIn 2014, based on pre-tax income, we had income tax expense of $9.6 million as compared to $17.6 million in 2013. The decrease in income tax expense of $8.0 million was primarily due to a benefit recorded for research and development activities of $14.4 million related to the tax years 1998-2014. This benefit was partially offset by an increase in pre-tax book income and an increase in non-deductible expenses. Ultimate recorded $13.2 million and $2.3 million of research and development tax credit carryforwards during the quarters ended September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. In management's opinion, this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the quarters presented. This information should be read in conjunction with Ultimate's Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future. Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, increased expenses (especially as they relate to product development, sales and marketing and the use of third-party\nconsultants), timing of product releases, increased competition, variations in the mix of revenues, announcements of new products by us or our competitors and capital spending patterns of our customers. We establish our expenditure levels based upon our expectations as to future revenues, and, if revenue levels are below expectations, expenses can be disproportionately high. A drop in near term demand for our products could significantly affect both revenues and profits in any quarter. Operating results achieved in previous fiscal quarters are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the full fiscal years or for any future periods. As a result of these factors, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly basis. We believe that, due to the underlying factors for quarterly fluctuations, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of Ultimate's operations are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

financial condition may be affected by such trends in the future. Ultimate's quarterly revenues and operating results\nhave varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future. Revenues have historically increased at higher rates in the fourth quarter of the year and at lower rates in the next succeeding quarter. We believe such seasonality is due to a number of factors, including our quota-based compensation arrangements, typical of those used in software companies, and year-end budgetary pressures on our customers. We believe that the seasonal trend that Ultimate has experienced in the past may continue in the foreseeable future.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn recent years, we have funded operations primarily from cash flows generated from operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $129.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments in marketable securities, reflecting a net increase of $10.9 million since December 31, 2014. Cash and cash equivalents and corporate investments in marketable securities accounted for $1.0 million and $9.9 million, respectively, of the total increase. The total increase was primarily due to cash provided by operations of $142.7 million (excluding the non-cash impact of the excess tax benefit from stock option exercises) and proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock from employee and non-employee director stock option exercises of $4.7 million, partially offset by cash purchases of property and equipment (including principal payments on financed equipment) of $55.4 million (which includes $23.3 million of capitalized labor costs, paid in cash, associated with the Development Project), cash of $43.1 million used for the repurchases of shares of Common Stock under our previously announced stock repurchase plan (\"Stock Repurchase Plan\"), cash used to settle employee tax withholding liabilities for vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units of $35.0 million, the effect of the exchange rate on cash of $2.4 million, and, to a lesser extent, net payments on borrowings of $0.6 million.\nOur operating cash inflows primarily consist of payments received from our UltiPro customers. Our operating cash outflows primarily consist of cash we invest in personnel and infrastructure to support the anticipated growth of our business, payments to vendors related to our services, payments under arrangements with third party vendors who provide hosting infrastructure services in connection with UltiPro, related sales and marketing costs, costs of operations and systems development and programming costs and, from time to time, payments for acquisitions. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $30.3 million during 2015 as compared with 2014. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operating income, after adjusting for the impact of non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and expense associated with stock-based compensation awards, partially offset by increased accounts receivable and increased cash paid for working capital, including prepaid commissions in association with increased sales.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $224.8 million for 2015 as compared with $535.2 million for 2014. The $310.4 million decrease from 2014 was primarily attributable to a decrease of $402.6 million in client funds received from our customers using the UltiPro payment services offering ( UltiPro Payment Services\u201d) and an increase in maturities of marketable securities of $1.3 million, partially offset by an increase in the purchases of marketable securities of $81.2 million (which includes $70.0 million of funds held for customers being invested in marketable securities in addition to our corporate funds), and an increase in cash purchases of property and equipment of $12.5 million (including an increase of $1.1 million of capitalized labor costs, paid in cash, associated with the Development Project). Beginning in December 2015, we began investing our customer funds in available for sale securities in addition to our corporate funds in accordance with our internal investment strategies. The portfolio predominantly consists of investment grade securities with long-term ratings of AAA and AA+ and short-term ratings A-1/P-1. Customer funds not invested in available for sale securities, temporarily held by us as a result of our UltiPro Payment Services, are invested in U.S. Government money market funds that invest in short-term, high quality money market instruments which consist of U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government Agency obligations and repurchase agreements collateralized by such obligations. The money market funds are rated AAA by Standard & Poor's and Aaa by Moody's. Any residual customer funds are held primarily in our bank accounts.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $117.3 million for 2015 as compared with $483.9 million for 2014. The $366.6 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to a decrease of $332.6 million in UltiPro Payment Services client fund obligations, a $23.2 million increase in cash used for the repurchases of shares of Common Stock under our Stock Repurchase Plan, an increase of $15.1 million in cash used to settle employee tax withholding liabilities for the vesting of restricted stock, and lower proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock from employee and non-employee director stock option exercises of $1.5 million, partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits from stock option exercises of $4.4 million and a decrease in net payments on other borrowings of $2.1 million.\nDays sales outstanding ( DSO\u201d), calculated on a trailing three-month basis, as of December 31, 2015 were 70 days as compared with 68 days as of December 31, 2014. The increase of two days was associated with stronger sales bookings at the end of 2015.\nDeferred revenues were $145.7 million at December 31, 2015, as compared with $109.7 million at December 31, 2014. The increase of $36.0 million in deferred revenues for 2015 was primarily due to higher deferred cloud revenues mainly attributable to increased sales.\nUltimate believes that cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. This belief is based upon, among other factors, management's expectations for future revenue growth, controlled expenses and collections of accounts receivable.\nWe did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2015.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not, and, as of December 31, 2015, we did not, have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in applicable SEC rules) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nItem 10 (e) of Regulation S-K, \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,\" defines and prescribes the use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measure of Non-GAAP Operating Income, which excludes non-cash stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles, meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.\nUltimate believes that this non-GAAP measure of financial results provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Ultimate's financial condition and results of operations. Ultimate's management uses this non-GAAP result to compare Ultimate's performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, for purposes of determining executive incentive compensation, and for budget and planning purposes. This measure is used in monthly financial reports prepared for management and in quarterly financial reports presented to Ultimate's Board of Directors. This measure may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nThis non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to such measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The principal limitation of this non-GAAP financial measure is that it excludes significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded. In addition, it is subject to inherent limitations as it reflects the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measure.\nTo compensate for these limitations, Ultimate presents its non-GAAP financial measure in connection with its GAAP result. Ultimate strongly urges investors and potential investors in Ultimate's securities to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measure to the comparable GAAP financial measure that is included in the table below and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business.\nWe exclude the following items from the non-GAAP financial measure, Non-GAAP Operating Income, as appropriate:\nStock-based compensation expense. Ultimate's non-GAAP financial measure of Non-GAAP Operating Income excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which consists of expenses for restricted stock and stock unit awards recorded in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\u201d For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, stock-based compensation expense was $82.4 million, $46.2 million and $32.8 million, respectively, on a pre-tax basis. Stock-based compensation expense is excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures because it is a non-cash expense that Ultimate does not consider part of ongoing operations when assessing its financial performance. Ultimate believes that such exclusion facilitates the comparison of results of ongoing operations for current and future periods with such results from past periods. For GAAP net income periods, non-GAAP reconciliations are calculated on a diluted weighted average share basis.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets. In accordance with GAAP, operating expenses include amortization of acquired intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of such assets. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the amortization of acquired intangible assets was $1.0 million, $1.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded from Ultimate's non-GAAP financial measures because it is a non-cash expense that Ultimate does not consider part of ongoing operations when assessing its financial performance. Ultimate believes that such\nexclusion facilitates comparisons to its historical operating results and to the results of other companies in the same industry, which have their own unique acquisition histories.\n For the Year"}
