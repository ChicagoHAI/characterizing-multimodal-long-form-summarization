MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor\u201d for forward-looking statements. Certain information contained herein or in other written or oral statements made by or on behalf of the Company or its subsidiaries are or may be viewed as forward-looking. Although the Company has taken appropriate care in developing any such information, forward-looking information involves risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact actual results. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, matters described in the Company's SEC filings such as exposure to market risks, anticipated cash flows or operating performance, future capital needs, and statutory or regulatory related issues. However, the Company, as a matter of policy, does not make any specific projections as to future earnings, nor does it endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by others. Whether or not actual results differ materially from forward-looking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events or developments. Also, the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) of National Western Life Group, Inc. (formerly National Western Life Insurance Company and subsidiaries) for the three years ended December 31, 2017 follows. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes beginning on page 84 of this report.\nOverview\nNational Western provides life insurance products on a global basis for the savings and protection needs of policyholders and annuity contracts for the asset accumulation and retirement needs of contract holders, both domestic and international residents. The company accepts funds from policyholders or contract holders and establishes a liability representing future obligations to pay the policy or contract holders and their beneficiaries. To ensure the company will be able to pay these future commitments, the funds received as premium payments and deposits are invested in high quality investments, primarily fixed income securities.\nDue to the business of accepting funds to pay future obligations in later years and the underlying economics, the relevant factors affecting the Company's overall business and profitability include the following:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>the level of sales and premium revenues collected\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>persistency of policies and contracts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>return on investments sufficient to produce acceptable spread margins over interest crediting rates\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>investment credit quality which minimizes the risk of default or impairment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>levels of policy benefits and costs to acquire business\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>the level of operating expenses\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>effect of interest rate changes on revenues and investments including asset and liability matching\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>maintaining adequate levels of capital and surplus\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>actual levels of surrenders, withdrawals, claims and interest spreads\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>changes in assumptions for amortization of deferred policy acquisition expenses and deferred sales inducements\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>changes in the fair value of derivative index options and embedded derivatives pertaining to fixed-index life and annuity products\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>pricing and availability of adequate reinsurance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>litigation subject to unfavorable judicial development, including the time and expense of litigation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company monitors these factors continually as key business indicators. The discussion that follows in this Item 7 includes these indicators and presents information useful to an overall understanding of the Company's business performance in 2017, incorporating required disclosures in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nImpact of Recent Business Environment\nThe Company's business is generally aided by an economic environment experiencing growth, whether moderate or vibrant, characterized by metrics which indicate improving employment data and increases in personal income growth. When the Federal Reserve increased the benchmark interest rate in December, it extolled solid growth and an acceleration in housing spending. The unemployment rate ended the year at 4.1% improving from 4.7% at the end of the previous year. Retail sales showed solid growth at year's end suggesting the economy exited 2017 with good momentum.\nWith regard to the credit market, industry analysts and observers generally agree that a sudden jump in interest rate levels, while presently a highly unlikely scenario, would be harmful to life insurers with interest-sensitive products as it could provide an impetus for abnormal levels of product surrenders and withdrawals at the same time fixed debt securities held by insurers declined in market value. Currently, the consensus view of the Federal Reserve's course of action is predicated on the thesis that the U.S. economy is in a position to absorb a series of interest rate hikes without impeding ongoing economic growth. A progression of carefully measured increases in interest rate levels would be beneficial to financial service institutions, including life insurance companies. After the rate increase in December 2017, the current interest rate path is for another three interest rate hikes in 2018. It is uncertain what direction and at what pace interest rate movements may occur in the future and what impact, if any, such movements would have on the Company's business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThe U.S. life insurance sector today is faced with an interest rate, economic and regulatory environment making strategic long-term planning decisions more challenging and vulnerable to inaccurate assessments. In an environment such as this, the need for a strong capital position that can cushion against unexpected bumps is critical for stability and ongoing business activity. The Company's operating strategy continues to be focused on maintaining capital levels substantially above regulatory and rating agency requirements. Our business model is predicated upon steady growth in invested assets while managing the block of business within profitability objectives. A key premise of our financial management is maintaining a high quality investment portfolio, well matched in terms of duration with policyholder obligations, that continues to outperform the industry with respect to adverse impairment experience. This discipline enables the Company to sustain resources more than adequate to fund future growth and absorb abnormal periods of cash outflows.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAccounting policies discussed below are those considered critical to an understanding of the Company's financial statements.\nImpairment of Investment Securities. The Company's accounting policy requires that a decline in the value of a security below its amortized cost basis be evaluated to determine if the decline is other-than-temporary. The primary factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value for fixed income and equity securities is other-than-temporary include: (a) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (b) the reasons for the decline in value (credit event, interest rate related, credit spread widening), (c) the overall financial condition as well as the near-term prospects of the issuer, (d) whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated principal and interest payments, and (e) that the Company does not intend or be required to sell the investment prior to recovery. In addition, certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows are evaluated periodically by the Company to update the estimated cash flows over the life of the security. If the Company determines that the fair value of the securitized financial asset is less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the previous purchase or prior impairment, then an other-than-temporary impairment charge is recognized. The Company would recognize impairment of securities due to changing interest rates or market dislocations only if the Company intended to sell the securities prior to recovery. When a security is deemed to be impaired, a charge is recorded equal to the difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security. In compliance with GAAP guidance the estimated credit versus the non-credit components are bifurcated, and the non-credit component is reclassified as unrealized losses in other comprehensive income. Once an impairment charge has been recorded, the fair value of the impaired investment becomes its new cost basis and the Company continues to review the other-than-temporarily impaired security for appropriate valuation on an ongoing basis. However, the new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs ( DPAC\u201d). The Company is required to defer certain policy acquisition costs and amortize them over future periods. These costs include commissions and certain other expenses that vary with and are directly associated with acquiring new business. The deferred costs are recorded as an asset commonly referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs. The DPAC asset balance is subsequently charged to income over the lives of the underlying contracts in relation to the anticipated emergence of revenue or profits. Actual revenue or profits can vary from Company estimates resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of amortization. The Company performs regular evaluations of its universal life and annuity contracts to determine if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised. Assumptions considered significant include surrender and lapse rates, mortality, expense levels, investment performance, and estimated interest spread. Should actual experience dictate that the Company change its assumptions regarding the emergence of future revenues or profits (commonly referred to as unlocking\u201d), the Company would record a charge or addition to bring its DPAC balance to the level it would have been if using the new assumptions from the inception date of each policy.\nDPAC is also subject to periodic recoverability and loss recognition testing. These tests ensure that the present value of future contract-related cash flows will support the capitalized DPAC balance to be amortized in the future. The present value of these cash flows, less the benefit reserve, is compared with the unamortized DPAC balance and if the DPAC balance is greater, the deficiency is charged to expense as a component of amortization and the asset balance is reduced to the recoverable amount. For more information about accounting for DPAC see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeferred Sales Inducements. Costs related to sales inducements offered on sales to new customers, principally on investment type contracts and primarily in the form of additional credits to the customer's account value or enhancements to interest credited for a specified period, which are beyond amounts currently being credited to existing contracts, are deferred and recorded as other assets. All other sales inducements are expensed as incurred and included in interest credited to contract holders' funds. Deferred sales inducements are amortized to income using the same methodology and assumptions as DPAC, and are included in interest credited to contract holders' funds. Deferred sales inducements are also periodically reviewed for recoverability. For more information about accounting for deferred sales inducements see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFuture Policy Benefits. Because of the long-term nature of insurance contracts, the Company is liable for policy benefit payments many years into the future. The liability for future policy benefits represents estimates of the present value of the Company's expected benefit payments, net of the related present value of future net premium collections. For traditional life insurance contracts, this is determined by standard actuarial procedures, using assumptions as to mortality (life expectancy), morbidity (health expectancy), persistency, and interest rates, which are based on the Company's experience with similar products. The assumptions used are those considered to be appropriate at the time the policies are issued. An additional provision is made on most products to allow for possible adverse deviation from the assumptions assumed. For universal life and annuity products, the Company's liability is the amount of the contract's account balance. Account balances are also subject to minimum liability calculations as a result of minimum guaranteed interest rates in the policies. While management and National Western actuaries have used their best judgment in determining the assumptions and in calculating the liability for future policy benefits, there is no assurance that the estimate of the liabilities reflected in the financial statements represents the Company's ultimate obligation. In addition, significantly different assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts. A discussion of the assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition. Premium income for the Company's traditional life insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium becomes due from policyholders. For annuity and universal life contracts, the amounts collected from policyholders are considered deposits and are not included in revenue. For these contracts, fee income consists of policy charges for policy administration, cost of insurance charges and surrender charges assessed against policyholders' account balances which are recognized in the period the services are provided.\nInvestment activities of the Company are integral to its insurance operations. Since life insurance benefits may not be paid until many years into the future, the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested with income reported as revenue when earned. Anticipated yields on investments are reflected in premium rates, contract liabilities, and other product contract features. These anticipated yields are implied in the interest required on the Company's net insurance liabilities (future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs) and contractual interest obligations in its insurance and annuity products. The Company benefits to the extent actual net investment income exceeds the required interest on net insurance liabilities and manages the rates it credits on its products to maintain the targeted excess or spread\u201d of investment earnings over interest credited. The Company will continue to be required to provide for future contractual obligations in the event of a decline in investment yield. For more information concerning revenue recognition, investment accounting, and interest sensitivity, please refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies; Note 3, Investments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; and the discussions under Investments in Item 7 of this report.\nPension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits. The Company sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan, which was frozen effective December 31, 2007, covering substantially all employees, and three non-qualified defined benefit plans covering certain senior officers. In addition, the Company has postretirement health care benefits for certain senior officers. The freeze of the qualified benefit pension plan ceased future benefit accruals to all participants and closed the Plan to any new participants. In addition, all participants became immediately 100% vested in their accrued benefits as of that date. In accordance with prescribed accounting standards, the Company annually reviews plan assumptions.\nThe Company annually reviews its pension benefit plans' assumptions which include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and the compensation increase rate. The assumed discount rate is set based on the rates of return on high quality long-term fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally set at the rate expected to be earned based on the long-term investment policy of the plans, the various classes of the invested funds, input of the plan's investment advisors and consulting actuary, and the plan's historic rate of return. The compensation rate increase assumption is generally set at a rate consistent with current and expected long-term compensation and salary policy, including inflation. These assumptions involve uncertainties and judgment, and therefore actual performance may not be reflective of the assumptions.\nOther postretirement benefit assumptions include future events affecting retirement age, mortality, dependency status, per capita claims costs by age, health care trend rates, and discount rates. Per capita claims cost by age is the current cost of providing postretirement health care benefits for one year at each age from the youngest age to the oldest age at which plan participants are expected to receive benefits under the plan. Health care trend rates involve assumptions about the annual rate(s) of change in the cost of health care benefits currently provided by the plan, due to factors other than changes in the composition of the plan population by age and dependency status. These rates implicitly consider estimates of health care inflation, changes in utilization, technological advances, and changes in health status of the participants.\nShare-Based Payments. Liability awards under a share-based payment arrangement have been measured based on the awards' fair value at the reporting date. The Black-Scholes valuation method is used to estimate the fair value of the options. This fair value calculation of the options includes assumptions relative to the following:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>exercise price\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>expected term based on contractual term and perceived future behavior relative to exercise\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>current price\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>expected volatility\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>risk-free interest rates\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>expected dividends\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese assumptions are continually reviewed by the Company and adjustments may be made based upon current facts and circumstances.\nOther significant accounting policies, although not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, but nonetheless important to an understanding of the financial statements, are described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). In addition, the Company regularly evaluates operating performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude or segregate derivative and realized investment gains and losses from operating revenues. Similar measures are commonly used in the insurance industry in order to assess profitability and results from ongoing operations. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances the understanding of the Company's results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors of the Company's business. The Company excludes or segregates derivative and realized investment gains and losses because such items are often the result of events which may or may not be at the Company's discretion and the fluctuating effects of these items could distort trends in the underlying profitability of the Company's business. Therefore, in the following sections discussing consolidated operations and segment operations, appropriate reconciliations have been included to report information management considers useful in enhancing an understanding of the Company's operations to reportable GAAP balances reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConsolidated Operations\nRevenues. The following details Company revenues:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and annuity contract charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Traditional life premiums\n</td> <td>18,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (excluding derivatives)\n</td> <td>436,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>21,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>636,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>640,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>644,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative gain (loss)\n</td> <td>222,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61,750\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>14,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>874,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>682,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>589,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUniversal life and annuity contract revenues - Revenues for universal life and annuity contract charges decreased slightly in 2017 compared to 2016 largely due to lower surrender charge revenue from terminated policies as shown below. Revenues for universal life and annuity products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration charges, and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances, less reinsurance premiums as depicted in the following table.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract Charges:\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of insurance and administrative charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Surrender charges\n</td> <td>42,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other charges\n</td> <td>(173\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,821\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contract revenues\n</td> <td>176,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance premiums\n</td> <td>(16,804\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,234\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,629\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net contract charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of insurance charges were $107.5 million in 2017 compared to $106.02 million in 2016 and $105.2 million in 2015. Cost of insurance charges typically trend with the size of the universal life insurance block in force and the amount of new business issued during the period. At December 31, 2017, the volume of universal life insurance in force decreased to $16.2 billion from $17.4 billion as of the end of 2016. However, during 2016 the Company increased its cost of insurance charges in accordance with its policy provisions on certain blocks of international life insurance policies which were in effect for the entirety of 2017 and helped to mitigate the decline in insurance in force. Administrative charges were $27.4 million, $27.8 million, and $28.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and correlate with new universal life insurance business sales by the number of policies placed, the amount of premiums received and the volume of insurance issued.\nSurrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances upon withdrawal were $42.1 million in 2017 compared to $44.8 million in 2016 and $41.3 million in 2015. While the Company earns surrender charge income that is assessed upon policy terminations, the Company's overall profitability is enhanced when policies remain in force and additional contract revenues are realized and the Company continues to make an interest rate spread equivalent to the difference it earns on its investment and the amounts that it credits to policyholders. Policy lapse rates in 2017 for domestic life insurance and annuities segments were improved from those experienced in 2016 while the international life segment continued to exhibit higher lapse rates. The spike in surrender charge income recognized in 2016 over 2015 reflects a higher international life insurance lapse rate, most noticeably in the countries from which the Company ceased accepting applications from residents in the fourth quarter of 2015. Surrender charge income recognized is also dependent upon the duration of policies at the time of surrender (i.e. later duration policy surrenders have lower surrender charges assessed and earlier policy surrenders have a higher surrender charge assessed).\nThe growth in domestic life insurance sales the past several years has been driven principally by the sale of single premium life insurance products. In 2013, the Company began deferring the premium load associated with these products and spreading it over future income periods. The amounts shown above as \"Other charges\" represent the net of current year deferrals of premium loads against previously capitalized amounts being amortized into revenue. During 2016, the amount of amortization of deferred premium loads overtook current period deferrals due to slightly lower sales compared to those in 2017 and 2015.\nTraditional life premiums - Traditional life premiums have been relatively level over the past three years. Traditional life insurance premiums for products such as whole life and term life are recognized as revenues over the premium-paying period. The Company's life insurance sales focus has been primarily centered around universal life products. Universal life products, especially the Company's equity-index universal life products, which offer the opportunity for consumers to acquire life insurance protection and receive credited interest linked in part to an outside market index such as the S&P 500 Index\u00ae, have been more popular product offerings in the Company's markets representing 93% of new life insurance sales in 2017. The majority of traditional life premiums reside in the Company's international life segment.\nNet investment income (with and without derivatives) - A detail of net investment income is provided below.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross investment income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt and equities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>409,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>416,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>416,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans\n</td> <td>11,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy loans\n</td> <td>3,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments\n</td> <td>1,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>197\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other invested assets\n</td> <td>13,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income\n</td> <td>438,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>441,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: investment expenses\n</td> <td>1,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (excluding derivatives)\n</td> <td>436,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative gain (loss)\n</td> <td>222,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61,750\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>659,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>467,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>379,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt and equity securities generated approximately 94% of total investment income, excluding derivative gains and losses, in 2017 consistent with prior years. The Company's strategy is to invest substantially all of its cash flows in fixed debt securities within its guidelines for credit quality, duration, and diversification. The Company has experienced incremental cash flow from new business and investment income from its portfolio to be used for investing in debt securities which has caused the debt securities portfolio to grow from $10.0 billion at December 31, 2015 to $10.2 billion at December 31, 2016 and to $10.3 billion at December 31, 2017. Investment yields on new bond purchases in 2017 remained below the portfolio's weighted average yield of approximately 3.97% at December 31, 2017. The yield on debt security purchases to fund insurance operations increased to 3.57% in 2017 from 3.38% in 2016. Also impacting bond portfolio returns has been the volume of higher yielding debt securities maturing or being called by borrowers with the proceeds being reinvested into lower yielding securities.\nThe Company's new mortgage loan activity has been relatively low in recent years given the low level of rates and the higher level of risk associated with commercial properties in this economic environment. Due to a concerted effort, the volume of new mortgage loan originations during 2017 and 2016 increased from prior year levels. Mortgage loan investment income in 2017 and 2015 were at slightly higher levels due to incremental contributions from loan prepayment fees and profit participation receipts during the year. Policy loan, short-term investments, and other invested asset balances outstanding have remained relatively stable over the past few years.\nIn order to evaluate underlying profitability and results from ongoing operations, net investment income performance is analyzed excluding derivative gain (loss), which is a common practice in the insurance industry. Net investment income and average invested assets shown below includes cash and cash equivalents. Net investment income performance is summarized as follows:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excluding derivatives:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>436,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average invested assets, at amortized cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,623,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,406,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,132,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual yield on average invested assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Including derivatives:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>659,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>467,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>379,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average invested assets, at amortized cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,781,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,486,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,209,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual yield on average invested assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.46\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.71\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decline in average invested asset yield, excluding derivatives, from 2015 to 2016 and to 2017 is due to the Company continuing to obtain lower yields on newly invested cash inflows. As described above, the Company invests substantially all of its net cash flows in debt securities whose new money yields have remained below the weighted average portfolio yield. The pattern in average invested asset yield, including derivatives, incorporates increases and decreases in the fair value of index options purchased by the Company to support its fixed-index products. Fair values of the purchased call options recorded net gains in 2017 and 2016 and a net loss in 2015 corresponding to the movement in the S&P 500 Index\u00ae during these periods (the primary index the Company's fixed-index products employ). Refer to the derivatives discussion following this section for a more detailed explanation.\nOther revenues - Other revenues primarily pertain to the Company's two nursing home operations in Reno, Nevada and San Marcos, Texas. Revenues associated with these operations were $18.2 million, $18.2 million and $20.6 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Beginning in 2017, other revenues includes the operations of Braker P III (\"BP III\"), a new subsidiary created at the end of 2016 to own and manage a commercial office building it acquired (Refer to Item 2. Properties in Part I of this filing for further discussion). Revenues associated with BP III were $1.5 million in 2017. Other revenues also includes the annual revaluation of fair value of the life interest in the Libbie Shearn Moody Trust.\nDerivative gain (loss) - Index options are derivative financial instruments used to hedge the equity return component of the Company's fixed-index products. Derivative gain or loss includes the amounts realized from the sale or expiration of the options. Since the index options do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under GAAP, they are marked to fair value on each reporting date and the resulting unrealized gain or loss is reflected as a component of net investment income.\nGains and losses from index options are substantially due to changes in equity market conditions. Index options are intended to act as hedges to match the returns on the product's underlying reference index and the rise or decline in the index relative to the index level at the time of the option purchase which causes option values to likewise rise or decline. As income from index options fluctuates with the underlying index, the contract interest expense to policyholder accounts for the Company's fixed-index products also fluctuates in a similar manner and direction. During 2017 and 2016, the reference indices increased and the Company recorded each year an overall gain from index options with a corresponding increase in contract interest expense in an amount relative to the gains recorded. In 2015, the reference indices decreased and an overall loss from index options was incurred and contract interest expense similarly declined.\nThe table below summarizes the derivative gain (loss) amounts and total contract interest by year.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(88,129\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gain (loss)\n</td> <td>148,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64,195\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gain (loss) included in net investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>222,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61,750\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contract interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>437,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe economic impact of option performance in the Company's financial statements is not generally determined solely by the option gain or loss included in net investment income as there is a corresponding amount recorded in the contract interest expense line. Rather, the Company's profitability with respect to these options is dependent upon the purchase cost of the option remaining within the financial budget for acquiring options embedded in the product pricing. Option prices vary with interest rates, volatility, and dividend yields among other things. As option prices vary, the Company manages for the variability by making offsetting adjustments to product caps, participation rates, and management fees. For the periods shown, the Company's option costs have been within the product pricing budgets.\nThe financial statement investment spread, the difference between investment income and interest credited to contractholders, is subject to variations from option performance during any given period. For example, many of the company's equity-index annuity products provide for the collection of asset management fees. These asset management fees are assessed when returns on expiring options are positive, and they are collected prior to passing any additional returns above the assessed management fees to the policy contractholders. During periods of positive returns, the collected asset management fees serve to increase the financial statement spread by increasing option realized gains reported as investment income in an amount greater than interest credited to policy contractholders which is reported as contract interest expense. Asset management fees collected in 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $31.8 million, $6.4 million, and $10.6 million, respectively.\nNet realized investment gains (losses) - Realized gains (losses) on investments include proceeds on bond calls and sales as well as impairment write-downs on investments in debt and equity securities and real estate. The net investment gains reported in 2017 consisted of gross gains of $15.0 million, primarily from calls of debt securities, offset by gross losses of $0.2 million, which included $0.1 million of other-than-temporary impairment losses. Included in the gross gains is approximately $2.3 million realized from a partial sale of the Company's previous home office land property to the Texas Department of Transportation to be used in the construction of roadway expansion.\nThe Company records impairment write-downs when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary and full recovery of the investment is not expected. Impairments due to credit factors are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings while non-credit (liquidity) impairment losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Impairment and valuation write-downs reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings are summarized in the following table.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment or valuation write-downs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equities\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEquity impairments (common stocks) represent a mark-to-market write-down on securities in which the market discount to book value was considered significant and had been maintained for several reporting periods. Equity securities represent 0.1% of invested assets and individual holdings have an average cost basis of approximately $43,000.\nBenefits and Expenses. The following details benefits and expenses.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life and other policy benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td>114,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and annuity contract interest\n</td> <td>437,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>107,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>729,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>529,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>443,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLife and other policy benefits - Life and other policy benefits include death claims of $38.6 million, $31.3 million and $38.2 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. While death claim amounts are subject to variation from period to period, the Company's mortality experience has generally been consistent with or better than its product pricing assumptions. Mortality exposure is managed through reinsurance treaties under which the Company's retained maximum net amount at risk on any one life is capped at $500,000.\nLife and other policy benefits also includes policy liabilities held associated with the company's traditional life products, including riders. The increases in these liabilities were $17.9 million, $17.5 million, and $19.8 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. In 2016, the company recorded a prospective unlocking adjustment (see below) which included the company's withdrawal benefit rider (\"WBR\"), a component of these policy liabilities. The effect of this prospective unlocking was to decrease WBR reserves by $3.1 million which decreased life and other policy benefits by a like amount.\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs - Life insurance companies are required to defer certain expenses that vary with, and are primarily related to, the cost of acquiring new business. The majority of these acquisition expenses consist of commissions paid to agents, underwriting costs, and certain marketing expenses. Recognition of these deferred policy acquisition costs ( DPAC\u201d) as an expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements occurs over future periods in relation to the expected emergence of profits priced into the products sold. This emergence of profits is based upon assumptions regarding premium payment patterns, mortality, persistency, investment performance, and expense patterns. Companies are required to review universal life and annuity contract assumptions periodically to ascertain whether actual experience has deviated significantly from that assumed. If it is determined that a significant deviation has occurred, the emergence of profits pattern is to be \"unlocked\" and reset based upon the actual experience. DPAC balances are also adjusted each period to reflect current policy lapse or termination rates, expense levels and credited rates on policies as compared to anticipated experience ( true-up\u201d) with the adjustment reflected in current period amortization expense. In accordance with GAAP guidance, the Company must also write off deferred acquisition costs and unearned revenue liabilities upon internal replacement of certain contracts as well as annuitizations of deferred annuities.\nThe following table identifies the effects of unlocking adjustments on DPAC balances recorded through amortization expense separate from recurring amortization expense components for 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DPAC\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking adjustments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,857\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,810\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other amortization components\n</td> <td>126,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2017, the Company unlocked its DPAC balance for: (1) International life favorable mortality, better than expected persistency from disengaged countries, and enforcement of an interest rate clawback on certain universal life policies which collectively reduced amortization expense by $28.0 million; (2) Annuity surrender/annuitization assumptions and tighter crediting rate spreads which increased amortization by $15.1 million; and (3) Domestic and International life crediting rate spreads on certain equity-indexed universal life products which increased amortization expense by $1.1 million.\nDuring 2016, the Company unlocked its DPAC balance for: (1) favorable mortality in the Domestic life insurance segment resulting in reduced amortization expense by $8.2 million; (2) International life insurance favorable mortality, increased cost of insurance charges that had been implemented during the year, and higher lapse assumptions for policies associated with residents in \"disengaged countries\" (countries which the Company ceased accepting applications from residents in 2015) collectively decreasing DPAC amortization expense by $7.3 million; (3) updating surrender and annuitization rates on indexed, single tier, and two tier annuities which increased DPAC amortization expense by $3.7 million; and (4) updating DPAC future profit projections for universal life insurance riders which had not been previously included in software models which resulted in decreasing DPAC amortization expense by $2.1 million.\nIn 2015, the Company unlocked its DPAC balance for: (1) International Life for favorable mortality experience on one of its universal life products, the effect of which was to decrease DPAC amortization expense by $7.1 million; and (2) Annuity future expense assumptions pertaining to product development override costs (trailer commissions) which it is obligated to pay certain contracted National Marketing Organizations, the effect of which was to increase DPAC amortization expense by $5.3 million.\nAs the DPAC balance is an asset on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, GAAP provides for an earned interest return on the unamortized balance each period. The earned interest serves to increase the DPAC balance and reduce other amortization component expense. The rate at which the DPAC balance earns interest is the average credited interest rate on the company's universal life and annuity policies in force, including credited interest on equity-indexed policies. The amount of earned interest on DPAC balances recorded was $33.5 million, $10.5 million, and $20.5 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, decreasing other amortization component expense.\nUniversal life and annuity contract interest - The Company closely monitors credited interest rates on interest sensitive policies, taking into consideration such factors as profitability goals, policyholder benefits, product marketability, and economic market conditions. As long-term interest rates change, the Company's credited interest rates are often adjusted accordingly, taking into consideration the factors described above. The difference between yields earned on investments over policy credited rates is often referred to as the \"interest spread\".\nThe Company's approximated average credited rates, excluding and including equity-indexed products, were as follows:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Excluding fixed-index products)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Including fixed-index products)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity\n</td> <td>2.19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.43\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.97\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.66\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest sensitive life\n</td> <td>3.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.71\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.77\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContract interest reported in financial statements also encompasses the performance of the index options associated with the Company's fixed-index products. As previously noted, the market value changes of these derivative features resulted in net realized and unrealized gains (losses) in 2017, 2016 and 2015 of $222.9 million, $28.4 million and $(61.8) million, respectively. In 2017, this figure was comprised of unrealized gains totaling $74.6 million plus realized gains of $148.3 million. These positive returns similarly increase the average credited rates for the periods shown.\nGenerally, the impact of the market value change of index options on asset values aligns closely with the movement of the embedded\nderivative liability held for the Company's fixed-index products such that the net effect upon pretax earnings is negligible (i.e. net\nrealized and unrealized gains/(losses) included in net investment income approximate the change in contract interest associated with the corresponding embedded derivative liability change). However, other aspects of the embedded derivatives can cause deviations to occur between the change in index option asset values included in net investment income and the change in the embedded derivative liability included in contract interest. As noted in the discussion of net investment income, the collection of asset management fees in a period can cause investment income to increase marginally higher than contract interest expense. In addition, accounting rules require the embedded derivative liability to include a projection of asset management fees estimated to be collected in the next fiscal year. The change in this projection, plus or minus, is included in contract interest expense for the period being reported on. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, contract interest was increased/(decreased) by $6.9 million, ($15.9 million), and $2.0 million, respectively, for this occurrence. Refer to Note 15 Derivative Investments in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nContract interest expense also includes reserve changes for immediate annuities, two tier annuities, excess death benefits, excess\nannuitizations, and amortization of deferred sales inducement balances. These items are offset by policy charges assessed for policies having the withdrawal benefit rider. As changes in these items collectively impact contract interest expense, financial statement interest spread is also affected. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 the changes in these items increased contract interest expense by $38.1 million, $46.9 million, and $42.8 million, respectively.\nSimilar to deferred policy acquisition costs, the Company defers sales inducements in the form of first year credited interest bonuses on annuity products that are directly related to the production of new business. These bonus interest charges are deferred and amortized using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize other capitalized acquisition costs and the amortization is included in contract interest. In addition, deferred sales inducement balances are also reviewed periodically to ascertain whether actual experience has deviated significantly from that assumed (unlock) and are adjusted to reflect current policy lapse or termination rates, expense levels and credited rates on policies compared to anticipated experience (true-up). These adjustments, plus or minus, are included in contract interest expense.\nAs part of the DPAC balance unlockings previously discussed for 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company unlocked its deferred sales inducement balance. The effect of the prospective unlocking was to decrease the deferred sales inducement balance by $4.3 million, $1.7 million, and $1.8 million, in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and thereby increasing contract interest expense by a related amount for each period.\nIn addition to the unlockings of the DPAC and deferred sales inducement balances in 2016 and 2017, the Company unlocked its excess benefit reserves (International life) and two tier annuity reserves. As noted previously, changes in these items are also components of contract interest expense. The unlockings of these reserves increased contract interest expense by $13.7 million and $3.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOther operating expenses - Other operating expenses consist of general administrative expenses, licenses and fees, commissions not subject to deferral, nursing home expenses, real estate expenses and compensation costs. These are summarized in the table that follows.\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General insurance expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nursing home expenses\n</td> <td>16,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation expenses\n</td> <td>27,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commission expenses\n</td> <td>10,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate expenses\n</td> <td>2,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxes, licenses and fees\n</td> <td>11,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral insurance expenses include expenditures for software and amortization of previously capitalized information technology\nexpenditures. The Company has progressively released into production components of system development over the past couple of years initiating amortization of these capitalized costs. Software costs, including amortization expense, for 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $9.0 million, $8.6 million, and $3.3 million, respectively. General insurance expenses also include payments and provisions made relating to potential or contingent legal liabilities. Expenses related to these items were $8.5 million, $4.2 million, and $0.1 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The 2017 amount pertains to an $8.2 million loss contingency recorded by the Company at December 31, 2017 related to excess premiums on certain of its policies. The 2016 amount includes a $1.3 million payment (including interest and expenses) to insurance authorities in Brazil pertaining to administrative proceedings in that country and a $2.9 million provision for an annuity contract matter in Puerto Rico in litigation. Refer to the Legal Proceedings narrative in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K.\nNursing home expenses reflect the operations of the Company's two facilities in Reno, Nevada and San Marcos, Texas. The lower expense level in 2017 compared to the prior two years corresponds with decreased revenues from lower census figures and the resultant cost containment measures undertaken to manage profitability.\nCompensation expenses include share-based compensation costs related to outstanding vested and nonvested stock options and stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\"), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), and performance share units (\"PSUs\"). The related share-based compensation costs move in tandem not only with the number of awards outstanding but also with the movement in the market price of the Company's Class A common stock as a result of marking the stock options, SARs, and RSUs to fair value under the liability method of accounting. Consequently, the related expense amount varies positive or negative in any given period. For the three years shown, share-based compensation expense totaled $5.0 million in 2017, $7.9 million in 2016 and $(0.9) million in 2015. These expense levels reflect a change in the Company's Class A common share price from $269.25 at December 31, 2014 to $251.94 at December 31, 2015 to $310.80 at December 31, 2016 and to $331.02 at December 31, 2017. In addition to the changes in price of the Company's Class A common shares, there were 22,184 and 14,643 SARs granted to officers of National Western in 2017 and 2016. No awards of stock options or SARs were granted in 2015.\nReal estate expenses shown for 2017 pertain to the commercial building operated by Braker P III. The building was acquired at year-end 2016.\nTaxes, licenses and fees include premium taxes and licensing fees paid to state insurance departments, guaranty fund assessments, the Company portion of social security and Medicare taxes, state income taxes, and other state and municipal taxes. State income taxes are generally determined by apportioning the company's federal taxable income based upon premium generated from a particular state as a percentage of total premiums. Federal taxable income is derived from the company's statutory financial results. State income tax expense was $2.5 million, $0.7 million, and $0.5 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Premium tax expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $4.0 million, $2.6 million, and $2.9 million, respectively. The 2017 expense also includes withholding tax liabilities for international policy distributions not previously withheld on.\nSegment Operations\nSummary of Segment Earnings\nA summary of segment earnings from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is provided below.

insurance. Revenues from traditional products are simply premiums collected, while revenues from universal life insurance consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, policy administration fees, and surrender charges assessed during the period. A comparative detail of premiums and contract revenues is provided below.\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life insurance revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Traditional life insurance premiums\n</td> <td>5,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance premiums\n</td> <td>(8,916\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,019\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,135\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's domestic life insurance in force in terms of policy counts has been declining for some time. The pace of new policies issued has lagged the number of policies terminating from death or surrender by roughly a two-to-one rate over the past several years causing a declining level of insurance in force from which contract revenue is received. Consequently, the number of domestic life insurance policies in force has declined from 54,300 at December 31, 2015 to 51,600 at December 31, 2016 and to 50,200 at December 31, 2017. Policy lapse rates in 2017 decreased to 6.0% from 7.5% in 2016 and were approximately the same in 2015 at 5.9%.\nUniversal life insurance revenues are also generated with the issuance of new business based upon amounts per application and percentages of the face amount (volume) of insurance issued. The number of domestic policies issued during 2017 was 14% higher than in 2016 and the volume of insurance issued was 17% more than that in 2016.\nIn 2013 the Company began deferring the premium load on its highest selling domestic product, single pay life insurance. Amounts deferred are amortized into revenues over future periods corresponding with the duration of the policies. Initially, the premium load amounts deferred exceeded the amounts amortized back into revenues. However, in 2016 the cumulative amounts deferred reached a level such that the current year revenue amortization exceeds the current period deferral resulting in net increasing revenue from this accounting method.\nPremium dollars collected on universal life products are not reflected as revenues in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings in accordance with GAAP. Actual domestic universal life premiums collected are detailed below.\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life insurance:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First year and single premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Renewal premiums\n</td> <td>20,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the past several years the Company has achieved some success in growing its domestic life insurance business. Sales have been substantially weighted toward single premium policies which do not have much in the way of recurring premium payments. These products are targeting wealth transfer strategies involving the movement of accumulated wealth in alternative investment vehicles, including annuities, into life insurance products. As a result, renewal premium levels have not been exhibiting a corresponding level of increase.\nNet investment income for this segment of business, excluding derivative gain/(loss), has been gradually increasing due to the increased new business activity described above (single premium policies) and a higher level of investments needed to support the corresponding growth in policy obligations, especially those for single premium policies. The increase in net investment income has been partially muted by lower investment yields from debt security investment purchases during this time frame. Net investment income also includes the gains and losses on index options purchased to back the index crediting mechanism on fixed-index universal life products. A detail of net investment income for domestic life insurance operations is provided below.\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (excluding derivatives)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative gain (loss)\n</td> <td>37,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,014\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life insurance contract interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor liability purposes, the embedded option in the Company's policyholder obligations for this feature is bifurcated and reserved for separately. Accordingly, the impact for the embedded derivative component in the equity-index universal life product is reflected in the contract interest expense for each respective period.\nLife and policy benefits for a smaller block of business are subject to variation from period to period. Claim activity during 2017 was marginally higher than in 2016 and but in line with historical trends. The number of incurred claims in 2017 declined a fraction of 1% from the prior year, while the average net claim amount increased from $24,800 to $27,700. The low face amount per claim reflects the older block of domestic life insurance policies sold which were final expense type products (i.e. purchased to cover funeral costs). The increase in the average net claim amount reflects claims from more recent policy sales (single premium wealth transfer products) which have much higher face amounts of insurance coverage per policy. The Company's overall mortality experience for this segment has been better than pricing assumptions.\nAs noted previously in the discussion of results from Consolidated Operations, the Company records true-up adjustments to DPAC balances each period to reflect current policy lapse or termination rates, expense levels and credited rates on policies as compared to anticipated experience with the adjustment reflected in current period amortization expense. To the extent required, the Company may also record unlocking adjustments to DPAC balances. The following table identifies the effects of unlocking adjustments on domestic life insurance DPAC balances recorded through amortization expense separate from recurring amortization expense components for 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DPAC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking adjustments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other amortization components\n</td> <td>9,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs noted in the Consolidated Operations discussion, the Company unlocked the interest crediting rate spread on certain equity-indexed universal life products during 2017 which increased amortization expense by $0.8 million. During 2016 for Company unlocked its DPAC balance for favorable mortality and for future profit projections related to universal life insurance riders which had not been previously included in DPAC actuarial software models. These unlockings decreased DPAC amortization expense.\nOperating expenses are allocated to lines of business based upon a functional cost analysis of the business activity giving rise to incurred expenses. As discussed in the Consolidated Operations section, the Company's overall operating expense levels increased in 2017 from the prior year, which resulted in operating expenses for this segment being higher.\nInternational Life Insurance Operations\nThe Company's international life operations have been a significant factor in the Company's overall earnings performance and represents a niche where the Company believes it has had a competitive advantage historically. A stable population of distribution relationships has been developed over decades of operations providing the Company with a consistent foundation for development of the block of business.\nA comparative analysis of results of operations for the Company's international life insurance segment is detailed below.\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums and other revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums and contract revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>68,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total premiums and other revenue\n</td> <td>189,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefits and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life and other policy benefits\n</td> <td>23,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td>(1,473\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life insurance contract interest\n</td> <td>54,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>36,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total benefits and expenses\n</td> <td>113,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment earnings before Federal income taxes\n</td> <td>75,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (benefit) for Federal income taxes\n</td> <td>16,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs with domestic life operations, revenues from the international life insurance segment include both premiums on traditional type products and revenues from universal life insurance.

Over the past three years, the volume of insurance in force has contracted from $19.0 billion at December 31, 2015 to $17.9 billion at December 31, 2016 and to $16.6 billion at December 31, 2017. The decline in volume of in force reflect the Company's decision at the end of 2015 to disengage from certain countries. Universal life insurance revenues are also generated with the issuance of new business based upon amounts per application and percentages of the face amount (volume) of insurance issued. During 2017, the number of international life policies decreased 12% from the prior year while the volume of insurance issued decreased approximately 20% from the level in 2016.\nA third component of international universal life revenues include surrender charges assessed upon surrender of contracts by policyholders. At the height of the financial crisis in 2008 through 2010, the Company's international policyholders exhibited concern regarding the developments in U.S. financial markets. This evidenced itself in the Company's termination activity in its international life policies in force. The Company incurred higher termination experience than is typical which resulted in recognition of increased surrender charge fee income. This level of termination activity subsequently subsided in 2011 with the termination activity over the following years remaining relatively level. In 2015, termination activity revisited the levels last seen during the 2008 through 2010 period resulting in additional surrender charge fee income, and this activity continued into 2016 and 2017. The following table illustrates the Company's international life termination experience over the past five years.\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume In Force Terminations\n</td> <td>Amount in $'s\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annualized Termination Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,309.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>2,340.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>2,659.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>1,825.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>1,838.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe higher incidence of terminations primarily is occurring with policies to residents of the countries from which the Company discontinued accepting applications in late 2015. As a result of the higher termination incidence, the Company unlocked its DPAC balances for this segment of the business during 2016 to incorporate a greater lapse assumption, among other things.\nAs noted previously, premiums collected on universal life products are not reflected as revenues in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings in accordance with GAAP. Actual international universal life premiums collected are detailed below.\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life insurance:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First year and single premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Renewal premiums\n</td> <td>86,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's most popular international products have been its fixed-index universal life products in which the policyholder can elect to have the interest rate credited to their policy account values linked in part to the performance of an outside equity index. Included in the totals in the above table are collected premiums for fixed-index universal life products of approximately $65.6 million, $74.9 million and $84.5 million for the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decline in renewal premiums during these periods corresponds with the increased termination activity discussed above.\nAs noted previously, net investment income and contract interest include period-to-period changes in fair values pertaining to call options purchased to hedge the interest crediting feature on the fixed-index universal life products. With the growth in the fixed-index universal life block of business, the period-to-period changes in fair values of the underlying options have had an increasingly greater impact on net investment income and universal life contract interest. A detail of net investment income for international life insurance operations is provided below.\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (excluding derivatives)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative gain (loss)\n</td> <td>33,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,284\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life insurance contract interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor liability purposes, the embedded option in the Company's policyholder obligations for this feature is bifurcated and reserved for separately. Accordingly, the impact for the embedded derivative component in the equity-index universal life product is reflected in the contract interest expense for each respective period.\nLife and policy benefits primarily consist of death claims on policies. The Company's clientele for international products are generally wealthy individuals with access to U.S. dollars and quality medical care. Consequently, the amounts of coverage purchased have historically tended to be larger amounts. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the average face amount of insurance purchased was approximately $306,300, reflecting a level somewhat lower than that of immediately prior years. While life and policy benefit expense for the international life segment reflects the larger policies purchased, mortality due to natural causes is comparable to that in the United States. The Company's maximum risk exposure per insured life is capped at $500,000 through reinsurance. The number of claims reported during 2017 was approximately 14% more than the prior year, and the average net claim (after reinsurance) increased from $137,900 to $152,200. Measured over a period of years, the Company's international life mortality experience has generally been better than product pricing assumptions.\nThe Company records true-up adjustments to DPAC balances each period to reflect current policy lapse or termination rates, expense levels and credited rates on policies as compared to anticipated experience as well as unlocking adjustments as necessary. The following table identifies the effects of unlocking adjustments on international life insurance DPAC balances recorded through amortization expense separate from recurring amortization components for 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DPAC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking adjustments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,732\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,490\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,120\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other amortization components\n</td> <td>26,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,473\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2017, the Company unlocked the DPAC balance for favorable mortality, lower than expected lapses from disengaged countries, the implementation of an interest crediting clawback on certain universal life policies, and the interest crediting rate spread on one of its equity-indexed universal life products which collectively decreased amortization expense by $27.7 million. During 2016, the Company unlocked the DPAC balance for: (1) favorable mortality, (2) higher cost of insurance charges which had been implemented, (3) increased lapse rates for disengaged countries, and (4) for future profit projections related to universal life insurance riders which had not been previously included in DPAC actuarial software models, the result of which collectively decreased amortization expense by $8.5 million. In 2015, the Company unlocked the DPAC balance for favorable mortality experience on one of its international universal life products. The effect of the prospective unlocking was to decrease amortization expense.\nAs indicated in the discussion concerning net investment income, contract interest expense includes fluctuations that are the result of the effect upon the embedded derivative for the performance of underlying equity indices associated with fixed-index universal life products. The amounts realized on purchased call options approximate the amounts the Company credits to policyholders. In addition, as part of the unlocking adjustments made during 2016, the Company's benefit reserves for the International Life segment were decreased by $6.2 million. The effect of this decrease was to correspondingly decrease contract interest for the year by a like amount.\nSimilar to the Domestic Life segment, operating expenses are allocated to lines of business based upon a functional cost analysis of the business activity giving rise to incurred expenses. As discussed in the Consolidated Operations section, the Company's overall operating expense levels increased in 2017 from the prior year, which resulted in operating expenses for this segment being higher. In addition, the potential and contingent legal liability provisions discussed in the Consolidated Operations section were primarily allocated to the International Life segment.\nAnnuity Operations\nThe Company's annuity operations are almost exclusively in the United States. Although some of the Company's investment contracts are available to international residents, current sales are small relative to total annuity sales.

The amount of the surrender charge income recognized is determined by the volume of surrendered contracts as well as the duration of each contract at the time of surrender given the pattern of declining surrender charge rates over time that is common to most annuity contracts. The Company's lapse rate for annuity contracts during 2017 was 6.0%, a decrease from a rate of 6.5% in 2016 and marginally lower than the 6.2% rate experienced in 2015.\nDeposits collected on annuity contracts are not reflected as revenues in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings in accordance with GAAP.

Since National Western does not offer variable products or mutual funds, fixed-index products provide an important alternative to the company's existing fixed interest rate annuity products. Fixed-index annuity deposits as a percentage of total annuity deposits were 95%, 94% and 93% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increasing percentage of fixed-index products to total annuity deposits reflects the low interest rate environment and the ongoing bull market in equities.\nAs a selling inducement, some of the deferred products, including fixed-index annuity products, contain a first year interest bonus ranging from 1% to 7% depending upon the product, in addition to the base first year interest rate. Other products include a premium bonus ranging from 2% to 10% which is credited to the account balance when premiums are applied. These bonus rates are deferred in conjunction with other capitalized policy acquisition costs. The amount deferred to be amortized over future periods amounted to approximately $17.9 million, $19.3 million and $17.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Amortization of deferred sales inducements is included as a component of annuity contract interest as described later in this discussion of annuity operations.\nA detail of net investment income for annuity operations is provided below.\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (excluding derivatives)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>338,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>346,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>348,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative gain (loss)\n</td> <td>152,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48,452\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>490,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>362,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity contract interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>322,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs previously described, derivatives are call options purchased to hedge the equity return component of National Western's fixed-index annuity products with any gains or losses from the sale or expiration of the options, as well as period-to-period changes in fair values, reflected in net investment income. Since the embedded derivative option in the policies is bifurcated when determining the contract reserve liability, the impact of the market value change of index options on asset values generally aligns closely with the movement of the embedded derivative liability such that the net effect upon pretax earnings is negligible (i.e. net realized and unrealized gains/(losses) included in net investment income approximate the change in contract interest associated with the corresponding embedded derivative liability change). See further discussion below regarding contract interest activity.\nConsistent with the domestic and international life segments, the Company records true-up adjustments to DPAC balances each period to reflect current policy lapse or termination rates, expense levels and credited rates on policies as compared to anticipated experience as well as unlocking adjustments as necessary. The following table identifies the effects of unlocking adjustments on annuity DPAC balances recorded through amortization expense separate from recurring amortization expense components for 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DPAC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking adjustments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other amortization components\n</td> <td>90,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2017, the Company unlocked the DPAC balance associated with its annuity segment for surrender/annuitization assumptions and interest crediting rate spreads. The effect of the prospective unlocking was to increase amortization expense by $15.1 million. During 2016, the annuity DPAC balance was unlocked for surrender and annuitization rates. The effect of this prospective unlocking was to increase amortization expense by $3.7 million. The Company also unlocked in 2015 for future expense assumptions pertaining to product development override costs (trailer commissions) which it is obligated to pay certain contracted National Marketing Organizations. The effect of the prospective unlocking was to increase amortization expense by $5.3 million.\nAnnuity contract interest includes the equity component return associated with the call options purchased to hedge National Western's fixed-index annuities. The detail of fixed-index annuity contract interest as compared to contract interest for all other annuities is as follows:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed-indexed annuities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>230,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other annuities\n</td> <td>81,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contract interest\n</td> <td>312,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bonus interest deferred and capitalized\n</td> <td>(17,901\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,302\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bonus interest amortization\n</td> <td>28,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contract interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>322,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe fluctuation in reported contract interest amounts for fixed-index annuities is driven by sales levels, the level of the business in force and the effect of positive or negative market returns of option values on projected interest credits. As noted above in the net investment income discussion, the amounts shown for contract interest for fixed-index annuities generally align with the derivative gains/(losses) included in net investment income as the impact of the market value change of index options on asset values aligns closely with the movement of the embedded derivative liability held for these products. As noted in the discussion in the Consolidated Operations section, positive returns on expiring options during 2017 led to an increase in collected asset management fees by National Western which are subtracted from contract interest credited to policyholders and lessens the increase in contract interest relative to the option gains reported in the Company's net investment income. Asset management fees collected during 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $31.8 million, $6.4 million, and $10.6 million, respectively.\nAs previously noted, accounting rules require the embedded derivative liability to include a projection of asset management fees to be collected over the next fiscal year. The change in this projection, plus or minus, is included in contract interest. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, for all of the Company's equity-indexed business, contract interest was increased/(decreased) by $6.9 million, ($15.9) million, and $2.0 million, respectively, for this occurrence. The annuity segment holds approximately two-thirds of the options outstanding at December 31, 2017.\nAnnuity contract interest includes true-up adjustments for the deferred sales inducement balance which are done each period similar to that done with respect to DPAC balances with the adjustment reflected in current period contract interest expense. To the extent required, the company may also record unlocking adjustments to deferred sales inducement balances in conjunction with DPAC balance unlockings. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 bonus interest amortization was increased by $4.3 million, $1.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively, for unlocking adjustments.\nThe unlocking in 2016, in addition to impacting the DPAC and deferred sales inducement balances, also increased the Company's benefit reserves by $12.2 million for the two-tiered deferred annuity block of business which in turn increased contract interest expense.\nSimilar to the Domestic Life insurance and International Life insurance segments, the Company's overall increase in operating expenses has been allocated to the Annuity segment based upon functional business activity and volumes. As annuity sales and transaction activity decreased somewhat in 2017 relative to the Domestic and International Life segments, the Annuity segment bore less of the overall increase in Company operating expenses.\nOther Operations\nThe Company's primary business encompasses its domestic and international life insurance operations and its annuity operations. However, the Company also has small real estate, nursing home, and other investment operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries. Nursing home operations generated $1.4 million, $0.3 million and $1.3 million of pre-tax earnings in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The 2017 results also include the operations of BP III which commenced operations at the beginning of the year. BP III incurred a pre-tax loss of $(1.5) million for the year.\nThe remaining pre-tax earnings in Other Operations of $26.8 million, $23.0 million, and $29.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, represent investment income from real estate, municipal bonds, and common and preferred equities held in subsidiary company portfolios principally for tax-advantage purposes. Included in these amounts are semi-annual distributions from a life interest in the Libby Shearn Moody Trust which is an asset held in NWLSM, Inc. Pretax distributions from this trust were $6.1 million, $6.0 million, and $7.0 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. In addition to pretax distributions, these amounts also include additional revenue recorded for annually revaluing the actuarial life interest in the Libbie Shearn Moody Trust.\nINVESTMENTS\nGeneral\nThe Company's investment philosophy emphasizes the careful handling of policyowners' and stockholders' funds to achieve security of principal, to obtain the maximum possible yield while maintaining security of principal, and to maintain liquidity in a measure consistent with current and long-term requirements of the Company.\nThe Company's overall conservative investment philosophy is reflected in the allocation of its investments, which is detailed below as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Company emphasizes investment grade debt securities.\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,288,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,201,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans\n</td> <td>208,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>174,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy loans\n</td> <td>56,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives, index options\n</td> <td>194,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate\n</td> <td>37,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities\n</td> <td>18,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>14,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,817,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,627,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's investment portfolio increased 2% to $10.8 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $10.6 billion at December 31, 2016 due to positive cash flows from operating and financing activities and the unrealized gain increases associated with investments reported at fair value. The primary driver of the increase in cash flows was investable funds generated from single premium life insurance and annuity sales and income receipts from the investment portfolio. Sales production resulted in approximately $608.8 million of annuity deposits collected and $131.6 million in single premium life premiums during 2017.\nA portion of the Company's securities are designated in the available for sale portfolio, which is reported at fair market value. Unrealized gains associated with this part of the portfolio increased from $69.3 million at December 31, 2016 to $82.2 million at December 31, 2017 incrementally adding to the total portfolio balance.\nDerivatives, index options, are call options purchased to hedge the interest crediting mechanism associated with the Company's fixed-index universal life and annuity policies. These options are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value in accordance with GAAP. The unrealized position of options held at December 31, 2017 was $119.4 million which was $74.6 million higher than the unrealized gain position at December 31, 2016 of $44.8 million. The increase is due to the higher equity index level at the end of 2017 relative to the market indice levels at the time outstanding options were purchased.\nDebt and Equity Securities\nThe Company maintains a diversified portfolio which consists mostly of corporate, mortgage-backed, and public utility fixed income securities. Investments in mortgage-backed securities primarily include U.S. government agency pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMO\"). The Company's investment guidelines prescribe limitations by type of security as a percent of the total investment portfolio and all holdings were within these threshold limits. As of December 31, the Company's debt securities portfolio consisted of the following for 2017 and 2016:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,343,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,097,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage-backed\n</td> <td>1,301,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,396,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public utilities\n</td> <td>1,149,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,218,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State and political subdivisions\n</td> <td>467,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>456,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. agencies\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset-backed securities\n</td> <td>13,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign governments\n</td> <td>10,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Treasury\n</td> <td>1,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,288,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,201,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubstantially all of the Company's investable cash flows are directed toward the purchase of long-term debt securities. The Company's investment policy calls for investing in debt securities that are investment grade, meet quality and yield objectives, and provide adequate liquidity for obligations to policyholders. Debt securities with intermediate maturities are targeted by the Company as they more closely match the intermediate nature of the Company's policy liabilities and provide an appropriate strategy for managing cash flows. The Company holds minimal levels of U.S. Treasury securities due to their low yields and deposits most of these holdings with various state insurance departments in order to meet security deposit on hand requirements in these jurisdictions.\nLong-term debt securities purchased to fund insurance company operations are summarized below.\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of acquisitions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>840,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>700,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average S&P quality\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective annual yield\n</td> <td>3.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spread to treasuries\n</td> <td>1.19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective duration\n</td> <td>8.1 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRating agencies generally view mortgage-backed securities as having additional risk for insurers holding interest sensitive liabilities given the potential for asset/liability disintermediation. Consequently, the Company holds predominantly agency mortgage-backed securities. Because mortgage-backed securities are subject to prepayment and extension risk, the Company has substantially reduced these risks by investing in collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMO\"), which have more predictable cash flow patterns than pass-through securities. These securities, known as planned amortization class I (\"PAC I\"), very accurately defined maturity (\"VADM\") and sequential tranches are designed to amortize in a more predictable manner than other CMO classes or pass-throughs. The Company does not purchase tranches, such as PAC II and support tranches, that subject the portfolio to greater than average prepayment risk. Using this strategy, the Company can more effectively manage and reduce prepayment and extension risks, thereby helping to maintain the appropriate matching of the Company's assets and liabilities.\nIn addition to diversification, an important aspect of the Company's investment approach is managing the credit quality of its investments in debt securities. Thorough credit analysis is performed on potential corporate investments including examination of a company's credit and industry outlook, financial ratios and trends, and event risks.

While additional losses are not currently anticipated, based on the existing status and condition of these securities, continued credit deterioration of some securities or the markets in general is possible, which may result in future write-downs.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles require that investments in debt securities be written down to fair value when declines in value are judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price methodology). Refer to Note 14, Fair Values of Financial Instruments, of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded no other-than-temporary impairment (\"OTTI\") credit related write-downs on debt securities and $0.1 million of OTTI on equity securities. See Note 3, Investments Debt and Equity Securities, of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nSince the Company's adoption of the GAAP guidance and accounting for other-than-temporary impairments due to credit loss versus non-credit loss, the Company has recognized a total of $0.6 million of other-than-temporary impairments of which $0.6 million were deemed credit related and recognized as realized investment losses in earnings, and $0.0 million that was deemed non-credit related impairments and recognized in other comprehensive income.\nThe Company is required to classify its investments in debt and equity securities into one of three categories: (a) trading securities; (b) securities available for sale; or (c) securities held to maturity. The Company purchases securities with the intent to hold to maturity and accordingly does not maintain a portfolio of trading securities. Of the remaining two categories, available for sale and held to maturity, the Company makes a determination on categorization based on various factors including the type and quality of the particular security and how it will be incorporated into the Company's overall asset/liability management strategy. As shown in the table below, at December 31, 2017, approximately 29.2% of the Company's total debt and equity securities, based on fair values, were classified as securities available for sale. These holdings in available for sale provide flexibility to the Company to react to market opportunities and conditions and to practice active management within the portfolio to provide adequate liquidity to meet policyholder obligations and other cash needs.\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unrealized Gains\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities held to maturity:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,434,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,247,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities available for sale:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt securities\n</td> <td>3,041,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,964,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities\n</td> <td>18,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,493,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,224,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>269,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsset-Backed Securities\nThe Company holds approximately $13.5 million in asset-backed securities as of December 31, 2017. This portfolio includes $1.0 million of manufactured housing bonds and $12.5 million of home equity loans (also referred to as subprime securities). These holdings have declined from the levels held at December 31, 2016 of $1.6 million and $18.4 million, respectively. The Company does not have any holdings in collaterized bond obligations ( CBO\u201ds), collateralized debt obligations ( CDO\u201ds), or collateralized loan obligations ( CLO\u201ds). Principal risks in holding asset-backed securities are structural, credit, and capital market risks. Structural risks include the securities' priority in the issuer's capital structure, the adequacy of and ability to realize proceeds from collateral and the potential for prepayments. Credit risks include corporate credit risks or consumer credit risks for financing such as subprime mortgages. Capital market risks include the general level of interest rates and the liquidity for these securities in the marketplace.\nThe Company's exposure to the subprime sector is limited to investments in the senior tranches of subprime residential mortgage loans. The subprime sector is generally categorized under the asset-backed sector. This sector lends to borrowers who do not qualify for prime interest rates due to poor or insufficient credit history. The slowing housing market, rising interest rates, and relaxed underwriting standards for loans originated after 2005 resulted in higher delinquency rates and losses beginning in 2007. These events caused illiquidity in the market and volatility in the market prices of subprime securities. The housing market subsequently stabilized and an improvement in the prices of subprime securities occurred as the bond market regained more liquidity. All of the loans classified as subprime in the Company's portfolio as of December 31, 2017 were underwritten prior to 2005 as noted in the table below.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Origination Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subprime:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal subprime\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company held seven subprime issues of which one was rated AA, one was rated A, one was rated BBB, one was rated BB, one was rated B, one was rated CCC and one was not rated.\nMortgage Loans and Real Estate\nThe Company originates loans on high quality, income-producing properties such as shopping centers, freestanding retail stores, office buildings, industrial, sales or service facilities, selected apartment buildings, hotels, and health care facilities. The location of these properties is typically in major metropolitan areas that offer a potential for property value appreciation. Credit and default risk is minimized through strict underwriting guidelines and diversification of underlying property types and geographic locations. In addition to being secured by the property, mortgage loans with leases on the underlying property are often guaranteed by the lease payments and also by the borrower. This approach has proved over time to result in quality mortgage loans with few defaults. Mortgage loan interest income is recognized on an accrual basis with any premium or discount amortized over the life of the loan. Prepayment and late fees are recorded on the date of collection.\nThe Company targets a minimum specified yield on mortgage loan investments determined by reference to currently available debt security instrument yields, plus a desired amount of incremental basis points. During the past several years, the low interest rate environment has resulted in fewer loan opportunities being available that meet the Company's required rate of return. Mortgage loans originated by the Company totaled $59.4 million and $84.6 million for the years 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLoans in foreclosure, loans considered impaired or loans past due 90 days or more are placed on a non-accrual status. If a mortgage loan is determined to be on non-accrual status, the mortgage loan does not accrue any revenue into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The loan is independently monitored and evaluated as to potential impairment or foreclosure. If delinquent payments are made and the loan is brought current, then the Company returns the loan to active status and accrues income accordingly. The Company has no loans past due 90 days which are accruing interest.\nThe Company's direct investments in real estate are not a significant portion of its total investment portfolio as most of these investments were acquired through mortgage loan foreclosures. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no real estate properties acquired through mortgage loan foreclosure. The Company also participates in several real estate joint ventures and limited partnerships that invest primarily in income-producing retail properties.\nThe Company held net investments in mortgage loans, after allowances for possible losses, totaling $208.2 million and $174.5 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The diversification of the portfolio by geographic region, property type, and loan-to-value ratio was as follows:\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Appraisals are required at the time of funding and may be updated if a material change occurs from the original loan agreement.\nThe greater than 90% category is related to loans made with a long standing borrower which are backed by the investment property, contracted leases and the guarantee of the borrower.\nAll mortgage loans are analyzed quarterly in order to monitor the financial quality of these assets. Based on ongoing monitoring, mortgage loans with a likelihood of becoming delinquent are identified and placed on an internal watch list\u201d. Among the criteria that would indicate a potential problem are: major tenant vacancies or bankruptcies, late payments, and loan relief/restructuring requests. The mortgage loan portfolio is analyzed for the need for a valuation allowance on any loan that is on the internal watch list, in the process of foreclosure or that currently has a valuation allowance.\nMortgage loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When it is determined that a loan is impaired, a loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the mortgage loan and the estimated value reduced by the cost to sell. Estimated value is typically based on the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. Impairments and changes in the valuation allowance are reported in net realized capital gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nThe Company recognized no valuation losses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The current mortgage loan valuation allowance represents a general valuation allowance established for the Company's mortgage loan portfolio based upon the Company's loss experience for more than ten years and is not specifically identified to individual loans.\nThe following table represents the mortgage loan allowance for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, beginning of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Releases\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company does not recognize interest income on loans past due ninety days or more.

The Company recognized operating income on these properties of approximately $2.9 million, $2.6 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company monitors the conditions and market values of these properties on a regular basis and makes repairs and capital improvements to keep the properties in good condition. The Company recorded net realized investment gains of $2.7 million, $2.9 million and $0.0 million associated with real estate investments in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDerivatives, Index Options\nThe Company offers fixed-index universal life and annuity products that guarantee the return of principal to policyholders and, at the policyholder's election, credit interest based on a percentage gain in a specified equity market index (policyholders may alternatively elect a fixed interest rate). Premiums and deposits received on these products are predominantly invested in investment grade fixed income securities with a portion used to purchase derivatives consisting of call options on the applicable market index to fund the index credits due to fixed-index policyholders. The call options purchased are one year over-the-counter option contracts coinciding with the initial issuance of the policy and subsequent annual renewal periods in order to match the Company's funding requirements for the underlying policies. On the respective anniversary dates of the index policies, the index used to compute the annual index credit is reset and a new one-year call option is purchased to fund the next annual index credit.\nAlthough the call options are employed to be effective hedges against the Company's policyholder obligations from an economic standpoint, they do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under GAAP. Accordingly, the call options are marked to fair value on each reporting date with the change in fair value, plus or minus, included as a component of net investment income. The change in fair value of the call options includes the gains or losses recognized at the expiration of the option term and the changes in fair value for open contracts.\nThe Company's design of its fixed-index products incorporates a budget for the purchase of over-the-counter call options to fund the index credits due to policyholders. Management monitors current prices of these call options and manages the cost of purchases through the terms of the policy contracts. These terms permit the Company to change caps, participation rates, and asset fees, subject to guaranteed minimums, thus managing the cost of the call options quoted by counterparties. In addition, the Company's product terms allow for the Company to withdraw from offering a particular index option at any time effective on the next policy anniversary date.\nThe fair value of derivative instruments presented in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements totaling $194.7 million at December 31, 2017 and $120.6 million at December 31, 2016 pertain to notional policyholder account values of $3.2 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, electing interest credits based upon applicable market index performance.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk of change in market values of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices, or equity prices. The most significant market risk exposure for National Western is interest rate risk. Substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the profitability of insurance products and fair value of investments. The yield realized on new investments generally increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes. The fair values of fixed income debt securities correlate to external market interest rate conditions as market values typically increase when market interest rates decline and decrease when market interest rates rise. However, market values may fluctuate for other reasons, such as changing economic conditions, market dislocations or increasing event-risk concerns.\nInterest Rate Risk\nA gradual increase in interest rates from current levels would generally be a positive development for the Company. Rate increases would be expected to provide incremental net investment income, produce increased sales of fixed rate products, and limit the potential erosion of the Company's interest rate spread on products due to minimum guaranteed crediting rates in products. Alternatively, a rise in interest rates would reduce the fair value of the Company's investment portfolio and if long-term rates rise dramatically within a relatively short time period could expose the Company to disintermediation risk. Disintermediation risk is the risk that policyholders will surrender their policies in a rising interest rate environment forcing the Company to liquidate assets when they are in an unrealized loss position.\nA decline in interest rates could cause certain mortgage-backed securities in the Company's portfolio to be more likely to pay down or prepay. In this situation, the Company typically will be unable to reinvest the proceeds at comparable yields. Lower interest rates will likely also cause lower net investment income, subject the Company to reinvestment rates risks, and possibly reduce profitability through reduced interest rate margins associated with products with minimum guaranteed crediting rates. Alternatively, the fair value of the Company's investment portfolio will increase when interest rates decline.\nThe correlation between fair values and interest rates for debt securities is reflected in the tables below.\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt securities - fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,475,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,379,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt securities - amortized cost\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,211,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,136,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value as a percentage of amortized cost\n</td> <td>102.58\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gains at year-end\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>243,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ten-year U.S. Treasury bond - increase (decrease) in yield for the year\n</td> <td>(0.04\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's unrealized gains balance for debt securities held at December 31, 2017 and 2016 is shown in the following table.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Unrealized Gains Balance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Balance at\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Balance at\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in Net\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt securities held to maturity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>187,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt securities available for sale\n</td> <td>76,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>243,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt securities held to maturity are recorded at their amortized cost basis. Accordingly, the unrealized gain amounts shown in the table above are not incorporated into the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nChanges in interest rates typically have a sizable effect on the fair values of the Company's debt securities. During 2017, the market interest rate of the ten-year U.S. Treasury bond decreased roughly 4 basis points from 2.45% at year-end 2016 to 2.41% at year-end 2017. Therefore, the increase in unrealized gains was partially the result of the marginal decrease in interest rates. The Company's unrealized gain position primarily improved from the prior year-end due to the narrowing of corporate debt security spreads during 2017. However, since the majority of the Company's debt securities are classified as held to maturity, which are recorded at amortized cost, changes in fair values have relatively small effects on the Company's financial results.\nThe Company manages interest rate risk principally through ongoing cash flow testing as required for insurance regulatory purposes. Computer models are used to perform cash flow testing under various commonly used stress test interest rate scenarios to determine if existing assets would be sufficient to meet projected liability outflows. Sensitivity analysis allows the Company to measure the potential gain or loss in fair value of its interest-sensitive instruments and to protect its economic value and achieve a predictable spread between what is earned on invested assets and what is paid on liabilities. The Company seeks to minimize the impact of interest risk through surrender charges that are imposed to discourage policy surrenders. Interest rate changes can be anticipated in the computer models and the corresponding risk addressed by management actions affecting asset and liability instruments. However, potential changes in the values of financial instruments indicated by hypothetical interest rate changes will likely be different from actual changes experienced, and the differences could be significant.\nThe Company has the ability to adjust interest rates, participation rates, and asset management fees and caps, as applicable, in response to changes in investment portfolio yields for a substantial portion of its business in force. The ability to adjust these rates is subject to competitive forces in the market for the Company's products. Surrender rates could increase and new sales could be negatively affected if crediting rates are not competitive with the rates on competing products offered by other insurance companies and financial service entities. The Company designs its products with features encouraging persistency. Interest sensitive life and annuity products have surrender and withdrawal penalty provisions. Typically, surrender charge rates gradually decrease each year the contract is in force.\nThe Company seeks to minimize the impact of interest rate risk through surrender charges that are imposed to discourage policy surrenders and to offset unamortized acquisition costs. Certain products, such as supplementary contracts with life contingencies, are not subject to surrender or discretionary withdrawal. The Company may also include a market value adjustment ( MVA\u201d) feature on its annuity products which could increase or decrease the amount paid to contract holders upon surrender of their contract as a means to further mitigate interest rate risk.\nThe following table profiles the Company's insurance liabilities at December 31, 2017 for annuities, deposit-type contracts and supplementary contracts with life contingencies by surrender and discretionary withdrawal characteristics.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subject to discretionary withdrawal:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>With market value adjustment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>973,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>With surrender charge of 5% or more\n</td> <td>5,480,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>With surrender charge of 5% or less\n</td> <td>969,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Not subject to discretionary withdrawal\n</td> <td>408,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,832,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nThe following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of the Company's interest rate sensitive assets.

Actual results could vary materially from those illustrated due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis. Expected maturities of debt securities may differ from contractual maturities due to call or prepayment provisions. The models assume that prepayments on mortgage-backed securities are influenced by agency and pool types, the level of interest rates, loan age, refinancing incentive, month of the year, and underlying coupon. During periods of declining interest rates, principal payments on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations tend to increase as the underlying mortgages are prepaid. Conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the rate of prepayment slows. Both of these situations can expose the Company to the possibility of asset-liability cash flow and yield mismatch. The model uses a proprietary method of sampling interest rate paths along with a mortgage prepayment model to derive future cash flows. The initial interest rates used are based on the current U.S. Treasury yield curve as well as current mortgage rates for the various types of collateral in the portfolio.\nMortgage and other loans were modeled by discounting scheduled cash flows through the scheduled maturities of the loans, starting with interest rates currently being offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings. Policy loans were modeled by discounting estimated cash flows using U.S. Treasury Bill interest rates as base rates at December 31, 2017. The estimated cash flows include assumptions as to whether such loans will be repaid by the policyholders or settled upon payment of death or surrender benefits on the underlying insurance contracts and incorporate both Company experience and mortality assumptions associated with such contracts.\nIn addition to the securities analyzed above, the Company invests in index options which are derivative financial instruments used to hedge the equity return component of the Company's indexed annuity and life products. The values of these options are primarily impacted by equity price risk, as the options' fair values are dependent on the performance of the underlying reference index. However, increases or decreases in investment returns from these options are substantially offset by corresponding increases or decreases in amounts paid to indexed policyholders, subject to minimum guaranteed policy interest rates.\nThe Company's market risk liabilities, which include policy liabilities for annuity and supplemental contracts, are managed for interest rate risk through cash flow testing as previously described. As part of this cash flow testing, the Company has analyzed the potential impact on net earnings of a 100 basis point decrease and increases in increments of 100 basis points in the U.S. Treasury yield curve as of December 31, 2017. The potential impact on net earnings from these interest rate changes are summarized below.\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Changes in Interest Rates in Basis Points\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>-100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+300\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact on net earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(912\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese estimated impacts on earnings are net of tax effects and the estimated effects of deferred policy acquisition costs.\nThe above described scenarios produce estimated changes in cash flows as well as cash flow reinvestment projections. Estimated cash flows in the Company's model assume cash flow reinvestments, which are representative of the Company's current investment strategy. Calls and prepayments include scheduled maturities and those expected to occur which would benefit the security issuers. Assumed policy surrenders consider differences and relationships between credited interest rates and market interest rates as well as surrender charges on individual policies. The impact to earnings also includes the expected effects on amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. The model considers only annuity and supplemental contracts in force at December 31, 2017, and does not consider new product sales or the possible impact of interest rate changes on sales.\nCredit Risk\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk through counterparties and within its investment portfolio. Credit risk relates to the uncertainty associated with an obligor's continued ability to make timely payments of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of an instrument or contract. As previously discussed, the Company manages credit risk through established investment credit policies and guidelines which address the quality of creditors and counterparties, concentration limits, diversification practices and acceptable risk levels. These policies and guidelines are regularly reviewed and approved by senior management and National Western's Board of Directors.\nIn connection with the Company's use of call options to hedge the equity return component of its fixed-indexed annuity and life products, the Company is exposed to the risk that a counterparty fails to perform under terms of the option contract. The Company purchases one-year option contracts from multiple counterparties and evaluates the creditworthiness of all counterparties prior to the purchase of the contracts. For consideration in contracting with a counterparty the rating required by the Company is a credit rating of A\u201d or higher. Accordingly, all options are purchased from nationally recognized financial institutions with a demonstrated performance for honoring their financial obligations and possessing substantial financial capacity. In addition, each counterparty is required to execute a credit support agreement obligating the counterparty to provide collateral to the Company when the fair value of the Company's exposure to the counterparty exceeds specified amounts. Counterparty credit ratings and credit exposure are monitored continuously by National Western's Investment department with adjustments to collateral levels managed under as incurred under the credit support agreements.\nThe Company's net exposure to loss due to credit risk if option counterparties failed to completely perform according to the terms of their one-year contracts is as follows at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

</tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has never incurred a loss on index options due to counterparty default.\nThe Company is also exposed to credit spread risk related to market prices of investment securities and cash flows associated with changes in credit spreads. Credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed debt securities and will increase the fair value of the investment portfolio. Credit spread widening will reduce the fair value of the investment portfolio and will increase net investment income on new purchases.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity\nLiquidity requirements are met primarily by funds provided from operations. Premium deposits and annuity considerations, investment income, and investment maturities and prepayments are the primary sources of funds while investment purchases, policy benefits in the form of claims, and payments to policyholders and contract holders in connection with surrenders and withdrawals as well as operating expenses are the primary uses of funds. To ensure the Company will be able to pay future commitments, the funds received as premium payments and deposits are invested in high quality investments, primarily fixed income securities. Funds are invested with the intent that the income from investments, plus proceeds from maturities, will meet the ongoing cash flow needs of the Company. The approach of matching asset and liability durations and yields requires an appropriate mix of investments. Although the Company historically has not been put in the position of having to liquidate invested assets to provide cash flow, its investments consist primarily of marketable debt securities that could be readily converted to cash for liquidity needs. The Company (National Western) may also borrow up to $40 million on its bank line of credit for short-term cash needs. There were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit at December 31, 2017.\nA primary liquidity concern for life insurers is the risk of an extraordinary level of early policyholder withdrawals, particularly with respect to annuity products whose funds tend to move more rapidly with interest rate changes. The Company includes provisions within its annuity and universal life insurance policies, such as surrender and market value adjustments, that help limit and discourage early withdrawals.\nThe following table sets forth withdrawal characteristics of National Western's annuity reserves and deposit liabilities (based on statutory reporting liability values) as of the dates indicated.\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Not subject to discretionary withdrawal provisions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>408,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>418,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subject to discretionary withdrawal, with adjustment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>With market value adjustment\n</td> <td>973,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,147,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At contract value less current surrender charge of 5% or more\n</td> <td>5,480,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,441,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal\n</td> <td>6,862,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,007,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value with no surrender charge or surrender charge of less than 5%\n</td> <td>969,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>721,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total annuity reserves and deposit liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,832,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,729,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe actual amounts paid out by product line in connection with surrenders and withdrawals for the years ended December 31 are noted in the table below.\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product Line:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Traditional Life\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal Life\n</td> <td>120,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuities\n</td> <td>515,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>516,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>493,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>640,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>638,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>586,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above contractual withdrawals, as well as the level of surrenders experienced, were generally consistent with the Company's assumptions in asset-liability management, and the associated cash outflows did not have an adverse impact on overall liquidity. The level of annuity dollar outflows is indicative of a steady block of business in force which added approximately $2.1 billion in deposits over the past three years. In addition, the maturation of policies within the block of business (i.e. moving into durations having no surrender charges or minimal surrender charges), has been gradual as evidenced by the previous table depicting withdrawal characteristics of the in force reserves. While individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may need to undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy elsewhere, the Company's disengagement from several international markets has influenced higher withdrawals from these areas since 2015. Cash flow projections and tests under various market interest rate scenarios and assumptions are performed to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy. The Company currently expects available liquidity sources and future cash flows to be more than adequate to meet the demand for funds.\nCash flows from the Company's insurance operations have historically been sufficient to meet current needs. Cash flows from operating activities were $276.1 million, $309.1 million, and $346.2 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The Company also has significant cash flows from both scheduled and unscheduled investment security maturities, redemptions, and prepayments. These cash flows totaled $0.8 billion, $0.6 billion, and $0.7 billion in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Cash flows from security maturities, redemptions, and prepayments coincide primarily with scheduled maturity dates of securities given the Company buy and hold investment philosophy but may become amplified during periods of significant declines in interest rates due to prepayments and bond calls. Conversely, these cash flow items could experience reduced levels of activity if interest rates rise in the future. Net cash inflows/(outflows) from the Company's universal life and annuity product operations totaled $(163.3) million, $(52.8) million, and $8.2 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nCapital Resources\nThe Company relies on retained earnings for its capital resources as there is no long-term debt outstanding and the Company does not anticipate the need for any long-term debt in the near future. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had no commitments beyond its normal operating and investment activities. The Company has declared and paid an annual dividend on its common shares since 2005 although its practice remains to substantially reinvest earnings internally to finance the development of new business. Despite the fact the Company's market price of its Class A common shares has been trading at a discount to the book value per share for some time, there are no imminent plans for the Company to repurchase its shares as the Board of Directors has adopted a strategic policy of building a strong capital base to maintain its high financial strength ratings and the ability to take competitive advantages and acquisitions as they arise. The capacity of National Western to pay dividends to NWLGI is limited by law in the state of Colorado to earned profits (statutory unassigned surplus). At December 31, 2017, the maximum amount legally available for distribution during 2018 without further regulatory approval is $127.3 million.\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\") has established risk-based capital (\"RBC\") standards for U.S. life insurers as well as a risk-based capital model act (\"RBC Model Act\"). The RBC Model Act requires that life insurers annually submit a report to state regulators regarding their RBC amounts based upon four categories of risk (asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, and business risk). The capital requirement for each is determined by applying factors that vary based upon the degree of risk to various asset, premium and policy benefit reserve items. The formula is an early warning tool to identify potential weakly capitalized companies for purposes of initiating further regulatory action. Independent rating agencies utilize proprietary versions similar to the NAIC RBC model incorporating additional risk factors identified in their respective rating methodology. At December 31, 2017, National Western maintained statutory capital substantially in excess of applicable statutory requirements.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nIt is not Company practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements or to issue guarantees to third parties, other than in the normal course of issuing insurance contracts. Commitments related to insurance products sold are reflected as liabilities for future policy benefits. Insurance contracts guarantee certain performances by National Western.\nInsurance reserves are the means by which life insurance companies determine the liabilities that must be established to assure that future policy benefits are provided for and can be paid. These reserves are required by law and based upon standard actuarial methodologies to ensure fulfillment of commitments guaranteed to policyholders and their beneficiaries, even though the obligations may not be due for many years. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of reserving methods.\nThe table below summarizes future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations.\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payment Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan commitments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>1,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life claims payable (2)\n</td> <td>55,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term reserve liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under GAAP (3)\n</td> <td>10,768,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>992,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,879,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,656,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,240,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,835,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,057,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,880,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,656,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,240,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Refer to Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies, of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements relating to Company leases.\n(2) Life claims payable include benefit and claim liabilities for which the Company believes the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable. Such amounts generally relate to incurred and reported death and critical illness claims including an estimate of claims incurred but not reported.\n(3) Other long-term liabilities include estimated life and annuity obligations related to death claims, policy surrenders, policy withdrawals, maturities and annuity payments based on mortality, lapse, annuitization, and withdrawal assumptions consistent with the Company's historical experience. These estimated life and annuity obligations are undiscounted projected cash outflows that assume interest crediting and market growth consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs. They do not include any offsets for future premiums or deposits. Other long-term liabilities also include determinable payout patterns related to immediate annuities. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the actual cash outflows will differ both in amount and timing, possibly materially, from these estimates.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND CHANGES IN

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor\u201d for forward-looking statements. Certain information contained herein or in other written or oral statements made by or on behalf of the Company or its subsidiaries are or may be viewed as forward-looking. Although the Company has taken appropriate care in developing any such information, forward-looking information involves risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact actual results. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, matters described in the Company's SEC filings such as exposure to market risks, anticipated cash flows or operating performance, future capital needs, and statutory or regulatory related issues. However, the Company, as a matter of policy, does not make any specific projections as to future earnings, nor does it endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by others. Whether or not actual results differ materially from forward-looking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events or developments. Also, the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) of National Western Life Group, Inc. (formerly National Western Life Insurance Company and subsidiaries) for the three years ended December 31, 2017 follows. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes beginning on page 84 of this report.\nOverview\nNational Western provides life insurance products on a global basis for the savings and protection needs of policyholders and annuity contracts for the asset accumulation and retirement needs of contract holders, both domestic and international residents. The company accepts funds from policyholders or contract holders and establishes a liability representing future obligations to pay the policy or contract holders and their beneficiaries. To ensure the company will be able to pay these future commitments, the funds received as premium payments and deposits are invested in high quality investments, primarily fixed income securities.\nDue to the business of accepting funds to pay future obligations in later years and the underlying economics, the relevant factors affecting the Company's overall business and profitability include the following:\n\nThe Company monitors these factors continually as key business indicators. The discussion that follows in this Item 7 includes these indicators and presents information useful to an overall understanding of the Company's business performance in 2017, incorporating required disclosures in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nImpact of Recent Business Environment\nThe Company's business is generally aided by an economic environment experiencing growth, whether moderate or vibrant, characterized by metrics which indicate improving employment data and increases in personal income growth. When the Federal Reserve increased the benchmark interest rate in December, it extolled solid growth and an acceleration in housing spending. The unemployment rate ended the year at 4.1% improving from 4.7% at the end of the previous year. Retail sales showed solid growth at year's end suggesting the economy exited 2017 with good momentum.\nWith regard to the credit market, industry analysts and observers generally agree that a sudden jump in interest rate levels, while presently a highly unlikely scenario, would be harmful to life insurers with interest-sensitive products as it could provide an impetus for abnormal levels of product surrenders and withdrawals at the same time fixed debt securities held by insurers declined in market value. Currently, the consensus view of the Federal Reserve's course of action is predicated on the thesis that the U.S. economy is in a position to absorb a series of interest rate hikes without impeding ongoing economic growth. A progression of carefully measured increases in interest rate levels would be beneficial to financial service institutions, including life insurance companies. After the rate increase in December 2017, the current interest rate path is for another three interest rate hikes in 2018. It is uncertain what direction and at what pace interest rate movements may occur in the future and what impact, if any, such movements would have on the Company's business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThe U.S. life insurance sector today is faced with an interest rate, economic and regulatory environment making strategic long-term planning decisions more challenging and vulnerable to inaccurate assessments. In an environment such as this, the need for a strong capital position that can cushion against unexpected bumps is critical for stability and ongoing business activity. The Company's operating strategy continues to be focused on maintaining capital levels substantially above regulatory and rating agency requirements. Our business model is predicated upon steady growth in invested assets while managing the block of business within profitability objectives. A key premise of our financial management is maintaining a high quality investment portfolio, well matched in terms of duration with policyholder obligations, that continues to outperform the industry with respect to adverse impairment experience. This discipline enables the Company to sustain resources more than adequate to fund future growth and absorb abnormal periods of cash outflows.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAccounting policies discussed below are those considered critical to an understanding of the Company's financial statements.\nImpairment of Investment Securities. The Company's accounting policy requires that a decline in the value of a security below its amortized cost basis be evaluated to determine if the decline is other-than-temporary. The primary factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value for fixed income and equity securities is other-than-temporary include: (a) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (b) the reasons for the decline in value (credit event, interest rate related, credit spread widening), (c) the overall financial condition as well as the near-term prospects of the issuer, (d) whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated principal and interest payments, and (e) that the Company does not intend or be required to sell the investment prior to recovery. In addition, certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows are evaluated periodically by the Company to update the estimated cash flows over the life of the security. If the Company determines that the fair value of the securitized financial asset is less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the previous purchase or prior impairment, then an other-than-temporary impairment charge is recognized. The Company would recognize impairment of securities due to changing interest rates or market dislocations only if the Company intended to sell the securities prior to recovery. When a security is deemed to be impaired, a charge is recorded equal to the difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security. In compliance with GAAP guidance the estimated credit versus the non-credit components are bifurcated, and the non-credit component is reclassified as unrealized losses in other comprehensive income. Once an impairment charge has been recorded, the fair value of the impaired investment becomes its new cost basis and the Company continues to review the other-than-temporarily impaired security for appropriate valuation on an ongoing basis. However, the new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs ( DPAC\u201d). The Company is required to defer certain policy acquisition costs and amortize them over future periods. These costs include commissions and certain other expenses that vary with and are directly associated with acquiring new business. The deferred costs are recorded as an asset commonly referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs. The DPAC asset balance is subsequently charged to income over the lives of the underlying contracts in relation to the anticipated emergence of revenue or profits. Actual revenue or profits can vary from Company estimates resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of amortization. The Company performs regular evaluations of its universal life and annuity contracts to determine if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised. Assumptions considered significant include surrender and lapse rates, mortality, expense levels, investment performance, and estimated interest spread. Should actual experience dictate that the Company change its assumptions regarding the emergence of future revenues or profits (commonly referred to as unlocking\u201d), the Company would record a charge or addition to bring its DPAC balance to the level it would have been if using the new assumptions from the inception date of each policy.\nDPAC is also subject to periodic recoverability and loss recognition testing. These tests ensure that the present value of future contract-related cash flows will support the capitalized DPAC balance to be amortized in the future. The present value of these cash flows, less the benefit reserve, is compared with the unamortized DPAC balance and if the DPAC balance is greater, the deficiency is charged to expense as a component of amortization and the asset balance is reduced to the recoverable amount. For more information about accounting for DPAC see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeferred Sales Inducements. Costs related to sales inducements offered on sales to new customers, principally on investment type contracts and primarily in the form of additional credits to the customer's account value or enhancements to interest credited for a specified period, which are beyond amounts currently being credited to existing contracts, are deferred and recorded as other assets. All other sales inducements are expensed as incurred and included in interest credited to contract holders' funds. Deferred sales inducements are amortized to income using the same methodology and assumptions as DPAC, and are included in interest credited to contract holders' funds. Deferred sales inducements are also periodically reviewed for recoverability. For more information about accounting for deferred sales inducements see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFuture Policy Benefits. Because of the long-term nature of insurance contracts, the Company is liable for policy benefit payments many years into the future. The liability for future policy benefits represents estimates of the present value of the Company's expected benefit payments, net of the related present value of future net premium collections. For traditional life insurance contracts, this is determined by standard actuarial procedures, using assumptions as to mortality (life expectancy), morbidity (health expectancy), persistency, and interest rates, which are based on the Company's experience with similar products. The assumptions used are those considered to be appropriate at the time the policies are issued. An additional provision is made on most products to allow for possible adverse deviation from the assumptions assumed. For universal life and annuity products, the Company's liability is the amount of the contract's account balance. Account balances are also subject to minimum liability calculations as a result of minimum guaranteed interest rates in the policies. While management and National Western actuaries have used their best judgment in determining the assumptions and in calculating the liability for future policy benefits, there is no assurance that the estimate of the liabilities reflected in the financial statements represents the Company's ultimate obligation. In addition, significantly different assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts. A discussion of the assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition. Premium income for the Company's traditional life insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium becomes due from policyholders. For annuity and universal life contracts, the amounts collected from policyholders are considered deposits and are not included in revenue. For these contracts, fee income consists of policy charges for policy administration, cost of insurance charges and surrender charges assessed against policyholders' account balances which are recognized in the period the services are provided.\nInvestment activities of the Company are integral to its insurance operations. Since life insurance benefits may not be paid until many years into the future, the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested with income reported as revenue when earned. Anticipated yields on investments are reflected in premium rates, contract liabilities, and other product contract features. These anticipated yields are implied in the interest required on the Company's net insurance liabilities (future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs) and contractual interest obligations in its insurance and annuity products. The Company benefits to the extent actual net investment income exceeds the required interest on net insurance liabilities and manages the rates it credits on its products to maintain the targeted excess or spread\u201d of investment earnings over interest credited. The Company will continue to be required to provide for future contractual obligations in the event of a decline in investment yield. For more information concerning revenue recognition, investment accounting, and interest sensitivity, please refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies; Note 3, Investments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; and the discussions under Investments in Item 7 of this report.\nPension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits. The Company sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan, which was frozen effective December 31, 2007, covering substantially all employees, and three non-qualified defined benefit plans covering certain senior officers. In addition, the Company has postretirement health care benefits for certain senior officers. The freeze of the qualified benefit pension plan ceased future benefit accruals to all participants and closed the Plan to any new participants. In addition, all participants became immediately 100% vested in their accrued benefits as of that date. In accordance with prescribed accounting standards, the Company annually reviews plan assumptions.\nThe Company annually reviews its pension benefit plans' assumptions which include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and the compensation increase rate. The assumed discount rate is set based on the rates of return on high quality long-term fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally set at the rate expected to be earned based on the long-term investment policy of the plans, the various classes of the invested funds, input of the plan's investment advisors and consulting actuary, and the plan's historic rate of return. The compensation rate increase assumption is generally set at a rate consistent with current and expected long-term compensation and salary policy, including inflation. These assumptions involve uncertainties and judgment, and therefore actual performance may not be reflective of the assumptions.\nOther postretirement benefit assumptions include future events affecting retirement age, mortality, dependency status, per capita claims costs by age, health care trend rates, and discount rates. Per capita claims cost by age is the current cost of providing postretirement health care benefits for one year at each age from the youngest age to the oldest age at which plan participants are expected to receive benefits under the plan. Health care trend rates involve assumptions about the annual rate(s) of change in the cost of health care benefits currently provided by the plan, due to factors other than changes in the composition of the plan population by age and dependency status. These rates implicitly consider estimates of health care inflation, changes in utilization, technological advances, and changes in health status of the participants.\nShare-Based Payments. Liability awards under a share-based payment arrangement have been measured based on the awards' fair value at the reporting date. The Black-Scholes valuation method is used to estimate the fair value of the options. This fair value calculation of the options includes assumptions relative to the following:\n\nThese assumptions are continually reviewed by the Company and adjustments may be made based upon current facts and circumstances.\nOther significant accounting policies, although not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, but nonetheless important to an understanding of the financial statements, are described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). In addition, the Company regularly evaluates operating performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude or segregate derivative and realized investment gains and losses from operating revenues. Similar measures are commonly used in the insurance industry in order to assess profitability and results from ongoing operations. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances the understanding of the Company's results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors of the Company's business. The Company excludes or segregates derivative and realized investment gains and losses because such items are often the result of events which may or may not be at the Company's discretion and the fluctuating effects of these items could distort trends in the underlying profitability of the Company's business. Therefore, in the following sections discussing consolidated operations and segment operations, appropriate reconciliations have been included to report information management considers useful in enhancing an understanding of the Company's operations to reportable GAAP balances reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConsolidated Operations\nRevenues. The following details Company revenues:\n\nUniversal life and annuity contract revenues - Revenues for universal life and annuity contract charges decreased slightly in 2017 compared to 2016 largely due to lower surrender charge revenue from terminated policies as shown below. Revenues for universal life and annuity products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration charges, and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances, less reinsurance premiums as depicted in the following table.\n\nCost of insurance charges were $107.5 million in 2017 compared to $106.02 million in 2016 and $105.2 million in 2015. Cost of insurance charges typically trend with the size of the universal life insurance block in force and the amount of new business issued during the period. At December 31, 2017, the volume of universal life insurance in force decreased to $16.2 billion from $17.4 billion as of the end of 2016. However, during 2016 the Company increased its cost of insurance charges in accordance with its policy provisions on certain blocks of international life insurance policies which were in effect for the entirety of 2017 and helped to mitigate the decline in insurance in force. Administrative charges were $27.4 million, $27.8 million, and $28.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and correlate with new universal life insurance business sales by the number of policies placed, the amount of premiums received and the volume of insurance issued.\nSurrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances upon withdrawal were $42.1 million in 2017 compared to $44.8 million in 2016 and $41.3 million in 2015. While the Company earns surrender charge income that is assessed upon policy terminations, the Company's overall profitability is enhanced when policies remain in force and additional contract revenues are realized and the Company continues to make an interest rate spread equivalent to the difference it earns on its investment and the amounts that it credits to policyholders. Policy lapse rates in 2017 for domestic life insurance and annuities segments were improved from those experienced in 2016 while the international life segment continued to exhibit higher lapse rates. The spike in surrender charge income recognized in 2016 over 2015 reflects a higher international life insurance lapse rate, most noticeably in the countries from which the Company ceased accepting applications from residents in the fourth quarter of 2015. Surrender charge income recognized is also dependent upon the duration of policies at the time of surrender (i.e. later duration policy surrenders have lower surrender charges assessed and earlier policy surrenders have a higher surrender charge assessed).\nThe growth in domestic life insurance sales the past several years has been driven principally by the sale of single premium life insurance products. In 2013, the Company began deferring the premium load associated with these products and spreading it over future income periods. The amounts shown above as \"Other charges\" represent the net of current year deferrals of premium loads against previously capitalized amounts being amortized into revenue. During 2016, the amount of amortization of deferred premium loads overtook current period deferrals due to slightly lower sales compared to those in 2017 and 2015.\nTraditional life premiums - Traditional life premiums have been relatively level over the past three years. Traditional life insurance premiums for products such as whole life and term life are recognized as revenues over the premium-paying period. The Company's life insurance sales focus has been primarily centered around universal life products. Universal life products, especially the Company's equity-index universal life products, which offer the opportunity for consumers to acquire life insurance protection and receive credited interest linked in part to an outside market index such as the S&P 500 Index\u00ae, have been more popular product offerings in the Company's markets representing 93% of new life insurance sales in 2017. The majority of traditional life premiums reside in the Company's international life segment.\nNet investment income (with and without derivatives) - A detail of net investment income is provided below.\n\nDebt and equity securities generated approximately 94% of total investment income, excluding derivative gains and losses, in 2017 consistent with prior years. The Company's strategy is to invest substantially all of its cash flows in fixed debt securities within its guidelines for credit quality, duration, and diversification. The Company has experienced incremental cash flow from new business and investment income from its portfolio to be used for investing in debt securities which has caused the debt securities portfolio to grow from $10.0 billion at December 31, 2015 to $10.2 billion at December 31, 2016 and to $10.3 billion at December 31, 2017. Investment yields on new bond purchases in 2017 remained below the portfolio's weighted average yield of approximately 3.97% at December 31, 2017. The yield on debt security purchases to fund insurance operations increased to 3.57% in 2017 from 3.38% in 2016. Also impacting bond portfolio returns has been the volume of higher yielding debt securities maturing or being called by borrowers with the proceeds being reinvested into lower yielding securities.\nThe Company's new mortgage loan activity has been relatively low in recent years given the low level of rates and the higher level of risk associated with commercial properties in this economic environment. Due to a concerted effort, the volume of new mortgage loan originations during 2017 and 2016 increased from prior year levels. Mortgage loan investment income in 2017 and 2015 were at slightly higher levels due to incremental contributions from loan prepayment fees and profit participation receipts during the year. Policy loan, short-term investments, and other invested asset balances outstanding have remained relatively stable over the past few years.\nIn order to evaluate underlying profitability and results from ongoing operations, net investment income performance is analyzed excluding derivative gain (loss), which is a common practice in the insurance industry. Net investment income and average invested assets shown below includes cash and cash equivalents. Net investment income performance is summarized as follows:\n\nThe decline in average invested asset yield, excluding derivatives, from 2015 to 2016 and to 2017 is due to the Company continuing to obtain lower yields on newly invested cash inflows. As described above, the Company invests substantially all of its net cash flows in debt securities whose new money yields have remained below the weighted average portfolio yield. The pattern in average invested asset yield, including derivatives, incorporates increases and decreases in the fair value of index options purchased by the Company to support its fixed-index products. Fair values of the purchased call options recorded net gains in 2017 and 2016 and a net loss in 2015 corresponding to the movement in the S&P 500 Index\u00ae during these periods (the primary index the Company's fixed-index products employ). Refer to the derivatives discussion following this section for a more detailed explanation.\nOther revenues - Other revenues primarily pertain to the Company's two nursing home operations in Reno, Nevada and San Marcos, Texas. Revenues associated with these operations were $18.2 million, $18.2 million and $20.6 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Beginning in 2017, other revenues includes the operations of Braker P III (\"BP III\"), a new subsidiary created at the end of 2016 to own and manage a commercial office building it acquired (Refer to Item 2. Properties in Part I of this filing for further discussion). Revenues associated with BP III were $1.5 million in 2017. Other revenues also includes the annual revaluation of fair value of the life interest in the Libbie Shearn Moody Trust.\nDerivative gain (loss) - Index options are derivative financial instruments used to hedge the equity return component of the Company's fixed-index products. Derivative gain or loss includes the amounts realized from the sale or expiration of the options. Since the index options do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under GAAP, they are marked to fair value on each reporting date and the resulting unrealized gain or loss is reflected as a component of net investment income.\nGains and losses from index options are substantially due to changes in equity market conditions. Index options are intended to act as hedges to match the returns on the product's underlying reference index and the rise or decline in the index relative to the index level at the time of the option purchase which causes option values to likewise rise or decline. As income from index options fluctuates with the underlying index, the contract interest expense to policyholder accounts for the Company's fixed-index products also fluctuates in a similar manner and direction. During 2017 and 2016, the reference indices increased and the Company recorded each year an overall gain from index options with a corresponding increase in contract interest expense in an amount relative to the gains recorded. In 2015, the reference indices decreased and an overall loss from index options was incurred and contract interest expense similarly declined.\nThe table below summarizes the derivative gain (loss) amounts and total contract interest by year.\n\nThe economic impact of option performance in the Company's financial statements is not generally determined solely by the option gain or loss included in net investment income as there is a corresponding amount recorded in the contract interest expense line. Rather, the Company's profitability with respect to these options is dependent upon the purchase cost of the option remaining within the financial budget for acquiring options embedded in the product pricing. Option prices vary with interest rates, volatility, and dividend yields among other things. As option prices vary, the Company manages for the variability by making offsetting adjustments to product caps, participation rates, and management fees. For the periods shown, the Company's option costs have been within the product pricing budgets.\nThe financial statement investment spread, the difference between investment income and interest credited to contractholders, is subject to variations from option performance during any given period. For example, many of the company's equity-index annuity products provide for the collection of asset management fees. These asset management fees are assessed when returns on expiring options are positive, and they are collected prior to passing any additional returns above the assessed management fees to the policy contractholders. During periods of positive returns, the collected asset management fees serve to increase the financial statement spread by increasing option realized gains reported as investment income in an amount greater than interest credited to policy contractholders which is reported as contract interest expense. Asset management fees collected in 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $31.8 million, $6.4 million, and $10.6 million, respectively.\nNet realized investment gains (losses) - Realized gains (losses) on investments include proceeds on bond calls and sales as well as impairment write-downs on investments in debt and equity securities and real estate. The net investment gains reported in 2017 consisted of gross gains of $15.0 million, primarily from calls of debt securities, offset by gross losses of $0.2 million, which included $0.1 million of other-than-temporary impairment losses. Included in the gross gains is approximately $2.3 million realized from a partial sale of the Company's previous home office land property to the Texas Department of Transportation to be used in the construction of roadway expansion.\nThe Company records impairment write-downs when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary and full recovery of the investment is not expected. Impairments due to credit factors are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings while non-credit (liquidity) impairment losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Impairment and valuation write-downs reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings are summarized in the following table.\n\nEquity impairments (common stocks) represent a mark-to-market write-down on securities in which the market discount to book value was considered significant and had been maintained for several reporting periods. Equity securities represent 0.1% of invested assets and individual holdings have an average cost basis of approximately $43,000.\nBenefits and Expenses. The following details benefits and expenses.\n\nLife and other policy benefits - Life and other policy benefits include death claims of $38.6 million, $31.3 million and $38.2 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. While death claim amounts are subject to variation from period to period, the Company's mortality experience has generally been consistent with or better than its product pricing assumptions. Mortality exposure is managed through reinsurance treaties under which the Company's retained maximum net amount at risk on any one life is capped at $500,000.\nLife and other policy benefits also includes policy liabilities held associated with the company's traditional life products, including riders. The increases in these liabilities were $17.9 million, $17.5 million, and $19.8 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. In 2016, the company recorded a prospective unlocking adjustment (see below) which included the company's withdrawal benefit rider (\"WBR\"), a component of these policy liabilities. The effect of this prospective unlocking was to decrease WBR reserves by $3.1 million which decreased life and other policy benefits by a like amount.\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs - Life insurance companies are required to defer certain expenses that vary with, and are primarily related to, the cost of acquiring new business. The majority of these acquisition expenses consist of commissions paid to agents, underwriting costs, and certain marketing expenses. Recognition of these deferred policy acquisition costs ( DPAC\u201d) as an expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements occurs over future periods in relation to the expected emergence of profits priced into the products sold. This emergence of profits is based upon assumptions regarding premium payment patterns, mortality, persistency, investment performance, and expense patterns. Companies are required to review universal life and annuity contract assumptions periodically to ascertain whether actual experience has deviated significantly from that assumed. If it is determined that a significant deviation has occurred, the emergence of profits pattern is to be \"unlocked\" and reset based upon the actual experience. DPAC balances are also adjusted each period to reflect current policy lapse or termination rates, expense levels and credited rates on policies as compared to anticipated experience ( true-up\u201d) with the adjustment reflected in current period amortization expense. In accordance with GAAP guidance, the Company must also write off deferred acquisition costs and unearned revenue liabilities upon internal replacement of certain contracts as well as annuitizations of deferred annuities.\nThe following table identifies the effects of unlocking adjustments on DPAC balances recorded through amortization expense separate from recurring amortization expense components for 2017, 2016 and 2015.\n\nIn 2017, the Company unlocked its DPAC balance for: (1) International life favorable mortality, better than expected persistency from disengaged countries, and enforcement of an interest rate clawback on certain universal life policies which collectively reduced amortization expense by $28.0 million; (2) Annuity surrender/annuitization assumptions and tighter crediting rate spreads which increased amortization by $15.1 million; and (3) Domestic and International life crediting rate spreads on certain equity-indexed universal life products which increased amortization expense by $1.1 million.\nDuring 2016, the Company unlocked its DPAC balance for: (1) favorable mortality in the Domestic life insurance segment resulting in reduced amortization expense by $8.2 million; (2) International life insurance favorable mortality, increased cost of insurance charges that had been implemented during the year, and higher lapse assumptions for policies associated with residents in \"disengaged countries\" (countries which the Company ceased accepting applications from residents in 2015) collectively decreasing DPAC amortization expense by $7.3 million; (3) updating surrender and annuitization rates on indexed, single tier, and two tier annuities which increased DPAC amortization expense by $3.7 million; and (4) updating DPAC future profit projections for universal life insurance riders which had not been previously included in software models which resulted in decreasing DPAC amortization expense by $2.1 million.\nIn 2015, the Company unlocked its DPAC balance for: (1) International Life for favorable mortality experience on one of its universal life products, the effect of which was to decrease DPAC amortization expense by $7.1 million; and (2) Annuity future expense assumptions pertaining to product development override costs (trailer commissions) which it is obligated to pay certain contracted National Marketing Organizations, the effect of which was to increase DPAC amortization expense by $5.3 million.\nAs the DPAC balance is an asset on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, GAAP provides for an earned interest return on the unamortized balance each period. The earned interest serves to increase the DPAC balance and reduce other amortization component expense. The rate at which the DPAC balance earns interest is the average credited interest rate on the company's universal life and annuity policies in force, including credited interest on equity-indexed policies. The amount of earned interest on DPAC balances recorded was $33.5 million, $10.5 million, and $20.5 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, decreasing other amortization component expense.\nUniversal life and annuity contract interest - The Company closely monitors credited interest rates on interest sensitive policies, taking into consideration such factors as profitability goals, policyholder benefits, product marketability, and economic market conditions. As long-term interest rates change, the Company's credited interest rates are often adjusted accordingly, taking into consideration the factors described above. The difference between yields earned on investments over policy credited rates is often referred to as the \"interest spread\".\nThe Company's approximated average credited rates, excluding and including equity-indexed products, were as follows:\n\nContract interest reported in financial statements also encompasses the performance of the index options associated with the Company's fixed-index products. As previously noted, the market value changes of these derivative features resulted in net realized and unrealized gains (losses) in 2017, 2016 and 2015 of $222.9 million, $28.4 million and $(61.8) million, respectively. In 2017, this figure was comprised of unrealized gains totaling $74.6 million plus realized gains of $148.3 million. These positive returns similarly increase the average credited rates for the periods shown.\nGenerally, the impact of the market value change of index options on asset values aligns closely with the movement of the embedded\nderivative liability held for the Company's fixed-index products such that the net effect upon pretax earnings is negligible (i.e. net\nrealized and unrealized gains/(losses) included in net investment income approximate the change in contract interest associated with the corresponding embedded derivative liability change). However, other aspects of the embedded derivatives can cause deviations to occur between the change in index option asset values included in net investment income and the change in the embedded derivative liability included in contract interest. As noted in the discussion of net investment income, the collection of asset management fees in a period can cause investment income to increase marginally higher than contract interest expense. In addition, accounting rules require the embedded derivative liability to include a projection of asset management fees estimated to be collected in the next fiscal year. The change in this projection, plus or minus, is included in contract interest expense for the period being reported on. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, contract interest was increased/(decreased) by $6.9 million, ($15.9 million), and $2.0 million, respectively, for this occurrence. Refer to Note 15 Derivative Investments in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nContract interest expense also includes reserve changes for immediate annuities, two tier annuities, excess death benefits, excess\nannuitizations, and amortization of deferred sales inducement balances. These items are offset by policy charges assessed for policies having the withdrawal benefit rider. As changes in these items collectively impact contract interest expense, financial statement interest spread is also affected. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 the changes in these items increased contract interest expense by $38.1 million, $46.9 million, and $42.8 million, respectively.\nSimilar to deferred policy acquisition costs, the Company defers sales inducements in the form of first year credited interest bonuses on annuity products that are directly related to the production of new business. These bonus interest charges are deferred and amortized using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize other capitalized acquisition costs and the amortization is included in contract interest. In addition, deferred sales inducement balances are also reviewed periodically to ascertain whether actual experience has deviated significantly from that assumed (unlock) and are adjusted to reflect current policy lapse or termination rates, expense levels and credited rates on policies compared to anticipated experience (true-up). These adjustments, plus or minus, are included in contract interest expense.\nAs part of the DPAC balance unlockings previously discussed for 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company unlocked its deferred sales inducement balance. The effect of the prospective unlocking was to decrease the deferred sales inducement balance by $4.3 million, $1.7 million, and $1.8 million, in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and thereby increasing contract interest expense by a related amount for each period.\nIn addition to the unlockings of the DPAC and deferred sales inducement balances in 2016 and 2017, the Company unlocked its excess benefit reserves (International life) and two tier annuity reserves. As noted previously, changes in these items are also components of contract interest expense. The unlockings of these reserves increased contract interest expense by $13.7 million and $3.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOther operating expenses - Other operating expenses consist of general administrative expenses, licenses and fees, commissions not subject to deferral, nursing home expenses, real estate expenses and compensation costs. These are summarized in the table that follows.\n\nGeneral insurance expenses include expenditures for software and amortization of previously capitalized information technology\nexpenditures. The Company has progressively released into production components of system development over the past couple of years initiating amortization of these capitalized costs. Software costs, including amortization expense, for 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $9.0 million, $8.6 million, and $3.3 million, respectively. General insurance expenses also include payments and provisions made relating to potential or contingent legal liabilities. Expenses related to these items were $8.5 million, $4.2 million, and $0.1 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The 2017 amount pertains to an $8.2 million loss contingency recorded by the Company at December 31, 2017 related to excess premiums on certain of its policies. The 2016 amount includes a $1.3 million payment (including interest and expenses) to insurance authorities in Brazil pertaining to administrative proceedings in that country and a $2.9 million provision for an annuity contract matter in Puerto Rico in litigation. Refer to the Legal Proceedings narrative in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K.\nNursing home expenses reflect the operations of the Company's two facilities in Reno, Nevada and San Marcos, Texas. The lower expense level in 2017 compared to the prior two years corresponds with decreased revenues from lower census figures and the resultant cost containment measures undertaken to manage profitability.\nCompensation expenses include share-based compensation costs related to outstanding vested and nonvested stock options and stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\"), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), and performance share units (\"PSUs\"). The related share-based compensation costs move in tandem not only with the number of awards outstanding but also with the movement in the market price of the Company's Class A common stock as a result of marking the stock options, SARs, and RSUs to fair value under the liability method of accounting. Consequently, the related expense amount varies positive or negative in any given period. For the three years shown, share-based compensation expense totaled $5.0 million in 2017, $7.9 million in 2016 and $(0.9) million in 2015. These expense levels reflect a change in the Company's Class A common share price from $269.25 at December 31, 2014 to $251.94 at December 31, 2015 to $310.80 at December 31, 2016 and to $331.02 at December 31, 2017. In addition to the changes in price of the Company's Class A common shares, there were 22,184 and 14,643 SARs granted to officers of National Western in 2017 and 2016. No awards of stock options or SARs were granted in 2015.\nReal estate expenses shown for 2017 pertain to the commercial building operated by Braker P III. The building was acquired at year-end 2016.\nTaxes, licenses and fees include premium taxes and licensing fees paid to state insurance departments, guaranty fund assessments, the Company portion of social security and Medicare taxes, state income taxes, and other state and municipal taxes. State income taxes are generally determined by apportioning the company's federal taxable income based upon premium generated from a particular state as a percentage of total premiums. Federal taxable income is derived from the company's statutory financial results. State income tax expense was $2.5 million, $0.7 million, and $0.5 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Premium tax expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $4.0 million, $2.6 million, and $2.9 million, respectively. The 2017 expense also includes withholding tax liabilities for international policy distributions not previously withheld on.\nSegment Operations\nSummary of Segment Earnings\nA summary of segment earnings from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is provided below. The segment earnings exclude realized gains and losses on investments, net of taxes.\n\nDomestic Life Insurance Operations\nA comparative analysis of results of operations for the Company's domestic life insurance segment is detailed below.\n\nRevenues from domestic life insurance operations include life insurance premiums on traditional type products and contract revenues from universal life insurance. Revenues from traditional products are simply premiums collected, while revenues from universal life insurance consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, policy administration fees, and surrender charges assessed during the period. A comparative detail of premiums and contract revenues is provided below.\n\nThe Company's domestic life insurance in force in terms of policy counts has been declining for some time. The pace of new policies issued has lagged the number of policies terminating from death or surrender by roughly a two-to-one rate over the past several years causing a declining level of insurance in force from which contract revenue is received. Consequently, the number of domestic life insurance policies in force has declined from 54,300 at December 31, 2015 to 51,600 at December 31, 2016 and to 50,200 at December 31, 2017. Policy lapse rates in 2017 decreased to 6.0% from 7.5% in 2016 and were approximately the same in 2015 at 5.9%.\nUniversal life insurance revenues are also generated with the issuance of new business based upon amounts per application and percentages of the face amount (volume) of insurance issued. The number of domestic policies issued during 2017 was 14% higher than in 2016 and the volume of insurance issued was 17% more than that in 2016.\nIn 2013 the Company began deferring the premium load on its highest selling domestic product, single pay life insurance. Amounts deferred are amortized into revenues over future periods corresponding with the duration of the policies. Initially, the premium load amounts deferred exceeded the amounts amortized back into revenues. However, in 2016 the cumulative amounts deferred reached a level such that the current year revenue amortization exceeds the current period deferral resulting in net increasing revenue from this accounting method.\nPremium dollars collected on universal life products are not reflected as revenues in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings in accordance with GAAP. Actual domestic universal life premiums collected are detailed below.\n\nDuring the past several years the Company has achieved some success in growing its domestic life insurance business. Sales have been substantially weighted toward single premium policies which do not have much in the way of recurring premium payments. These products are targeting wealth transfer strategies involving the movement of accumulated wealth in alternative investment vehicles, including annuities, into life insurance products. As a result, renewal premium levels have not been exhibiting a corresponding level of increase.\nNet investment income for this segment of business, excluding derivative gain/(loss), has been gradually increasing due to the increased new business activity described above (single premium policies) and a higher level of investments needed to support the corresponding growth in policy obligations, especially those for single premium policies. The increase in net investment income has been partially muted by lower investment yields from debt security investment purchases during this time frame. Net investment income also includes the gains and losses on index options purchased to back the index crediting mechanism on fixed-index universal life products. A detail of net investment income for domestic life insurance operations is provided below.\n\nFor liability purposes, the embedded option in the Company's policyholder obligations for this feature is bifurcated and reserved for separately. Accordingly, the impact for the embedded derivative component in the equity-index universal life product is reflected in the contract interest expense for each respective period.\nLife and policy benefits for a smaller block of business are subject to variation from period to period. Claim activity during 2017 was marginally higher than in 2016 and but in line with historical trends. The number of incurred claims in 2017 declined a fraction of 1% from the prior year, while the average net claim amount increased from $24,800 to $27,700. The low face amount per claim reflects the older block of domestic life insurance policies sold which were final expense type products (i.e. purchased to cover funeral costs). The increase in the average net claim amount reflects claims from more recent policy sales (single premium wealth transfer products) which have much higher face amounts of insurance coverage per policy. The Company's overall mortality experience for this segment has been better than pricing assumptions.\nAs noted previously in the discussion of results from Consolidated Operations, the Company records true-up adjustments to DPAC balances each period to reflect current policy lapse or termination rates, expense levels and credited rates on policies as compared to anticipated experience with the adjustment reflected in current period amortization expense. To the extent required, the Company may also record unlocking adjustments to DPAC balances. The following table identifies the effects of unlocking adjustments on domestic life insurance DPAC balances recorded through amortization expense separate from recurring amortization expense components for 2017, 2016 and 2015.\n\nAs noted in the Consolidated Operations discussion, the Company unlocked the interest crediting rate spread on certain equity-indexed universal life products during", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor\u201d for forward-looking statements. Certain information contained herein or in other written or oral statements made by or on behalf of the Company or its subsidiaries are or may be viewed as forward-looking.

Whether or not actual results differ materially from forward-looking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events or developments. Also, the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) of National Western Life Group, Inc. (formerly National Western Life Insurance Company and subsidiaries) for the three years ended December 31, 2017 follows. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes beginning on page 84 of this report.\nOverview\nNational Western provides life insurance products on a global basis for the savings and protection needs of policyholders and annuity contracts for the asset accumulation and retirement needs of contract holders, both domestic and international residents. The company accepts funds from policyholders or contract holders and establishes a liability representing future obligations to pay the policy or contract holders and their beneficiaries. To ensure the company will be able to pay these future commitments, the funds received as premium payments and deposits are invested in high quality investments, primarily fixed income securities.\nDue to the business of accepting funds to pay future obligations in later years and the underlying economics, the relevant factors affecting the Company's overall business and profitability include the following:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>the level of sales and premium revenues collected\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>persistency of policies and contracts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>return on investments sufficient to produce acceptable spread margins over interest crediting rates\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>investment credit quality which minimizes the risk of default or impairment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>levels of policy benefits and costs to acquire business\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>the level of operating expenses\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>effect of interest rate changes on revenues and investments including asset and liability matching\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>maintaining adequate levels of capital and surplus\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>actual levels of surrenders, withdrawals, claims and interest spreads\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>changes in assumptions for amortization of deferred policy acquisition expenses and deferred sales inducements\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>changes in the fair value of derivative index options and embedded derivatives pertaining to fixed-index life and annuity products\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>pricing and availability of adequate reinsurance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>litigation subject to unfavorable judicial development, including the time and expense of litigation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company monitors these factors continually as key business indicators. The discussion that follows in this Item 7 includes these indicators and presents information useful to an overall understanding of the Company's business performance in 2017, incorporating required disclosures in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nImpact of Recent Business Environment\nThe Company's business is generally aided by an economic environment experiencing growth, whether moderate or vibrant, characterized by metrics which indicate improving employment data and increases in personal income growth. When the Federal Reserve increased the benchmark interest rate in December, it extolled solid growth and an acceleration in housing spending. The unemployment rate ended the year at 4.1% improving from 4.7% at the end of the previous year. Retail sales showed solid growth at year's end suggesting the economy exited 2017 with good momentum.\nWith regard to the credit market, industry analysts and observers generally agree that a sudden jump in interest rate levels, while presently a highly unlikely scenario, would be harmful to life insurers with interest-sensitive products as it could provide an impetus for abnormal levels of product surrenders and withdrawals at the same time fixed debt securities held by insurers declined in market value. Currently, the consensus view of the Federal Reserve's course of action is predicated on the thesis that the U.S. economy is in a position to absorb a series of interest rate hikes without impeding ongoing economic growth. A progression of carefully measured increases in interest rate levels would be beneficial to financial service institutions, including life insurance companies. After the rate increase in December 2017, the current interest rate path is for another three interest rate hikes in 2018. It is uncertain what direction and at what pace interest rate movements may occur in the future and what impact, if any, such movements would have on the Company's business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThe U.S. life insurance sector today is faced with an interest rate, economic and regulatory environment making strategic long-term planning decisions more challenging and vulnerable to inaccurate assessments. In an environment such as this, the need for a strong capital position that can cushion against unexpected bumps is critical for stability and ongoing business activity. The Company's operating strategy continues to be focused on maintaining capital levels substantially above regulatory and rating agency requirements. Our business model is predicated upon steady growth in invested assets while managing the block of business within profitability objectives. A key premise of our financial management is maintaining a high quality investment portfolio, well matched in terms of duration with policyholder obligations, that continues to outperform the industry with respect to adverse impairment experience. This discipline enables the Company to sustain resources more than adequate to fund future growth and absorb abnormal periods of cash outflows.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAccounting policies discussed below are those considered critical to an understanding of the Company's financial statements.\nImpairment of Investment Securities. The Company's accounting policy requires that a decline in the value of a security below its amortized cost basis be evaluated to determine if the decline is other-than-temporary. The primary factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value for fixed income and equity securities is other-than-temporary include: (a) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (b) the reasons for the decline in value (credit event, interest rate related, credit spread widening), (c) the overall financial condition as well as the near-term prospects of the issuer, (d) whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated principal and interest payments, and (e) that the Company does not intend or be required to sell the investment prior to recovery. In addition, certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows are evaluated periodically by the Company to update the estimated cash flows over the life of the security. If the Company determines that the fair value of the securitized financial asset is less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the previous purchase or prior impairment, then an other-than-temporary impairment charge is recognized. The Company would recognize impairment of securities due to changing interest rates or market dislocations only if the Company intended to sell the securities prior to recovery. When a security is deemed to be impaired, a charge is recorded equal to the difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security. In compliance with GAAP guidance the estimated credit versus the non-credit components are bifurcated, and the non-credit component is reclassified as unrealized losses in other comprehensive income. Once an impairment charge has been recorded, the fair value of the impaired investment becomes its new cost basis and the Company continues to review the other-than-temporarily impaired security for appropriate valuation on an ongoing basis. However, the new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs ( DPAC\u201d). The Company is required to defer certain policy acquisition costs and amortize them over future periods. These costs include commissions and certain other expenses that vary with and are directly associated with acquiring new business. The deferred costs are recorded as an asset commonly referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs. The DPAC asset balance is subsequently charged to income over the lives of the underlying contracts in relation to the anticipated emergence of revenue or profits. Actual revenue or profits can vary from Company estimates resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of amortization. The Company performs regular evaluations of its universal life and annuity contracts to determine if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised. Assumptions considered significant include surrender and lapse rates, mortality, expense levels, investment performance, and estimated interest spread. Should actual experience dictate that the Company change its assumptions regarding the emergence of future revenues or profits (commonly referred to as unlocking\u201d), the Company would record a charge or addition to bring its DPAC balance to the level it would have been if using the new assumptions from the inception date of each policy.\nDPAC is also subject to periodic recoverability and loss recognition testing. These tests ensure that the present value of future contract-related cash flows will support the capitalized DPAC balance to be amortized in the future. The present value of these cash flows, less the benefit reserve, is compared with the unamortized DPAC balance and if the DPAC balance is greater, the deficiency is charged to expense as a component of amortization and the asset balance is reduced to the recoverable amount. For more information about accounting for DPAC see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeferred Sales Inducements. Costs related to sales inducements offered on sales to new customers, principally on investment type contracts and primarily in the form of additional credits to the customer's account value or enhancements to interest credited for a specified period, which are beyond amounts currently being credited to existing contracts, are deferred and recorded as other assets. All other sales inducements are expensed as incurred and included in interest credited to contract holders' funds. Deferred sales inducements are amortized to income using the same methodology and assumptions as DPAC, and are included in interest credited to contract holders' funds. Deferred sales inducements are also periodically reviewed for recoverability. For more information about accounting for deferred sales inducements see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFuture Policy Benefits. Because of the long-term nature of insurance contracts, the Company is liable for policy benefit payments many years into the future. The liability for future policy benefits represents estimates of the present value of the Company's expected benefit payments, net of the related present value of future net premium collections. For traditional life insurance contracts, this is determined by standard actuarial procedures, using assumptions as to mortality (life expectancy), morbidity (health expectancy), persistency, and interest rates, which are based on the Company's experience with similar products. The assumptions used are those considered to be appropriate at the time the policies are issued. An additional provision is made on most products to allow for possible adverse deviation from the assumptions assumed. For universal life and annuity products, the Company's liability is the amount of the contract's account balance. Account balances are also subject to minimum liability calculations as a result of minimum guaranteed interest rates in the policies. While management and National Western actuaries have used their best judgment in determining the assumptions and in calculating the liability for future policy benefits, there is no assurance that the estimate of the liabilities reflected in the financial statements represents the Company's ultimate obligation. In addition, significantly different assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts. A discussion of the assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition. Premium income for the Company's traditional life insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium becomes due from policyholders. For annuity and universal life contracts, the amounts collected from policyholders are considered deposits and are not included in revenue. For these contracts, fee income consists of policy charges for policy administration, cost of insurance charges and surrender charges assessed against policyholders' account balances which are recognized in the period the services are provided.\nInvestment activities of the Company are integral to its insurance operations. Since life insurance benefits may not be paid until many years into the future, the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested with income reported as revenue when earned. Anticipated yields on investments are reflected in premium rates, contract liabilities, and other product contract features. These anticipated yields are implied in the interest required on the Company's net insurance liabilities (future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs) and contractual interest obligations in its insurance and annuity products. The Company benefits to the extent actual net investment income exceeds the required interest on net insurance liabilities and manages the rates it credits on its products to maintain the targeted excess or spread\u201d of investment earnings over interest credited. The Company will continue to be required to provide for future contractual obligations in the event of a decline in investment yield. For more information concerning revenue recognition, investment accounting, and interest sensitivity, please refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies; Note 3, Investments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; and the discussions under Investments in Item 7 of this report.\nPension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits. The Company sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan, which was frozen effective December 31, 2007, covering substantially all employees, and three non-qualified defined benefit plans covering certain senior officers. In addition, the Company has postretirement health care benefits for certain senior officers. The freeze of the qualified benefit pension plan ceased future benefit accruals to all participants and closed the Plan to any new participants. In addition, all participants became immediately 100% vested in their accrued benefits as of that date. In accordance with prescribed accounting standards, the Company annually reviews plan assumptions.\nThe Company annually reviews its pension benefit plans' assumptions which include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and the compensation increase rate. The assumed discount rate is set based on the rates of return on high quality long-term fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally set at the rate expected to be earned based on the long-term investment policy of the plans, the various classes of the invested funds, input of the plan's investment advisors and consulting actuary, and the plan's historic rate of return. The compensation rate increase assumption is generally set at a rate consistent with current and expected long-term compensation and salary policy, including inflation. These assumptions involve uncertainties and judgment, and therefore actual performance may not be reflective of the assumptions.\nOther postretirement benefit assumptions include future events affecting retirement age, mortality, dependency status, per capita claims costs by age, health care trend rates, and discount rates. Per capita claims cost by age is the current cost of providing postretirement health care benefits for one year at each age from the youngest age to the oldest age at which plan participants are expected to receive benefits under the plan. Health care trend rates involve assumptions about the annual rate(s) of change in the cost of health care benefits currently provided by the plan, due to factors other than changes in the composition of the plan population by age and dependency status. These rates implicitly consider estimates of health care inflation, changes in utilization, technological advances, and changes in health status of the participants.\nShare-Based Payments. Liability awards under a share-based payment arrangement have been measured based on the awards' fair value at the reporting date. The Black-Scholes valuation method is used to estimate the fair value of the options. This fair value calculation of the options includes assumptions relative to the following:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>exercise price\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>expected term based on contractual term and perceived future behavior relative to exercise\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>current price\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>expected volatility\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>risk-free interest rates\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>expected dividends\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese assumptions are continually reviewed by the Company and adjustments may be made based upon current facts and circumstances.\nOther significant accounting policies, although not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, but nonetheless important to an understanding of the financial statements, are described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). In addition, the Company regularly evaluates operating performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude or segregate derivative and realized investment gains and losses from operating revenues. Similar measures are commonly used in the insurance industry in order to assess profitability and results from ongoing operations. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances the understanding of the Company's results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors of the Company's business. The Company excludes or segregates derivative and realized investment gains and losses because such items are often the result of events which may or may not be at the Company's discretion and the fluctuating effects of these items could distort trends in the underlying profitability of the Company's business. Therefore, in the following sections discussing consolidated operations and segment operations, appropriate reconciliations have been included to report information management considers useful in enhancing an understanding of the Company's operations to reportable GAAP balances reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConsolidated Operations\nRevenues.

Revenues for universal life and annuity products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration charges, and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances, less reinsurance premiums as depicted in the following table.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract Charges:\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of insurance and administrative charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Surrender charges\n</td> <td>42,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other charges\n</td> <td>(173\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,821\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contract revenues\n</td> <td>176,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance premiums\n</td> <td>(16,804\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,234\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,629\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net contract charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of insurance charges were $107.5 million in 2017 compared to $106.02 million in 2016 and $105.2 million in 2015. Cost of insurance charges typically trend with the size of the universal life insurance block in force and the amount of new business issued during the period. At December 31, 2017, the volume of universal life insurance in force decreased to $16.2 billion from $17.4 billion as of the end of 2016. However, during 2016 the Company increased its cost of insurance charges in accordance with its policy provisions on certain blocks of international life insurance policies which were in effect for the entirety of 2017 and helped to mitigate the decline in insurance in force. Administrative charges were $27.4 million, $27.8 million, and $28.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and correlate with new universal life insurance business sales by the number of policies placed, the amount of premiums received and the volume of insurance issued.\nSurrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances upon withdrawal were $42.1 million in 2017 compared to $44.8 million in 2016 and $41.3 million in 2015. While the Company earns surrender charge income that is assessed upon policy terminations, the Company's overall profitability is enhanced when policies remain in force and additional contract revenues are realized and the Company continues to make an interest rate spread equivalent to the difference it earns on its investment and the amounts that it credits to policyholders. Policy lapse rates in 2017 for domestic life insurance and annuities segments were improved from those experienced in 2016 while the international life segment continued to exhibit higher lapse rates. The spike in surrender charge income recognized in 2016 over 2015 reflects a higher international life insurance lapse rate, most noticeably in the countries from which the Company ceased accepting applications from residents in the fourth quarter of 2015. Surrender charge income recognized is also dependent upon the duration of policies at the time of surrender (i.e. later duration policy surrenders have lower surrender charges assessed and earlier policy surrenders have a higher surrender charge assessed).\nThe growth in domestic life insurance sales the past several years has been driven principally by the sale of single premium life insurance products. In 2013, the Company began deferring the premium load associated with these products and spreading it over future income periods. The amounts shown above as \"Other charges\" represent the net of current year deferrals of premium loads against previously capitalized amounts being amortized into revenue. During 2016, the amount of amortization of deferred premium loads overtook current period deferrals due to slightly lower sales compared to those in 2017 and 2015.\nTraditional life premiums - Traditional life premiums have been relatively level over the past three years. Traditional life insurance premiums for products such as whole life and term life are recognized as revenues over the premium-paying period. The Company's life insurance sales focus has been primarily centered around universal life products. Universal life products, especially the Company's equity-index universal life products, which offer the opportunity for consumers to acquire life insurance protection and receive credited interest linked in part to an outside market index such as the S&P 500 Index\u00ae, have been more popular product offerings in the Company's markets representing 93% of new life insurance sales in 2017. The majority of traditional life premiums reside in the Company's international life segment.\nNet investment income (with and without derivatives) - A detail of net investment income is provided below.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross investment income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt and equities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>409,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>416,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>416,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans\n</td> <td>11,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy loans\n</td> <td>3,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments\n</td> <td>1,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>197\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other invested assets\n</td> <td>13,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income\n</td> <td>438,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>441,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: investment expenses\n</td> <td>1,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (excluding derivatives)\n</td> <td>436,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative gain (loss)\n</td> <td>222,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61,750\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>659,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>467,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>379,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt and equity securities generated approximately 94% of total investment income, excluding derivative gains and losses, in 2017 consistent with prior years. The Company's strategy is to invest substantially all of its cash flows in fixed debt securities within its guidelines for credit quality, duration, and diversification. The Company has experienced incremental cash flow from new business and investment income from its portfolio to be used for investing in debt securities which has caused the debt securities portfolio to grow from $10.0 billion at December 31, 2015 to $10.2 billion at December 31, 2016 and to $10.3 billion at December 31, 2017. Investment yields on new bond purchases in 2017 remained below the portfolio's weighted average yield of approximately 3.97% at December 31, 2017. The yield on debt security purchases to fund insurance operations increased to 3.57% in 2017 from 3.38% in 2016. Also impacting bond portfolio returns has been the volume of higher yielding debt securities maturing or being called by borrowers with the proceeds being reinvested into lower yielding securities.\nThe Company's new mortgage loan activity has been relatively low in recent years given the low level of rates and the higher level of risk associated with commercial properties in this economic environment. Due to a concerted effort, the volume of new mortgage loan originations during 2017 and 2016 increased from prior year levels. Mortgage loan investment income in 2017 and 2015 were at slightly higher levels due to incremental contributions from loan prepayment fees and profit participation receipts during the year. Policy loan, short-term investments, and other invested asset balances outstanding have remained relatively stable over the past few years.\nIn order to evaluate underlying profitability and results from ongoing operations, net investment income performance is analyzed excluding derivative gain (loss), which is a common practice in the insurance industry. Net investment income and average invested assets shown below includes cash and cash equivalents. Net investment income performance is summarized as follows:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excluding derivatives:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>436,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average invested assets, at amortized cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,623,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,406,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,132,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual yield on average invested assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Including derivatives:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>659,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>467,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>379,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average invested assets, at amortized cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,781,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,486,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,209,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual yield on average invested assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.46\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.71\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decline in average invested asset yield, excluding derivatives, from 2015 to 2016 and to 2017 is due to the Company continuing to obtain lower yields on newly invested cash inflows. As described above, the Company invests substantially all of its net cash flows in debt securities whose new money yields have remained below the weighted average portfolio yield. The pattern in average invested asset yield, including derivatives, incorporates increases and decreases in the fair value of index options purchased by the Company to support its fixed-index products. Fair values of the purchased call options recorded net gains in 2017 and 2016 and a net loss in 2015 corresponding to the movement in the S&P 500 Index\u00ae during these periods (the primary index the Company's fixed-index products employ). Refer to the derivatives discussion following this section for a more detailed explanation.\nOther revenues - Other revenues primarily pertain to the Company's two nursing home operations in Reno, Nevada and San Marcos, Texas. Revenues associated with these operations were $18.2 million, $18.2 million and $20.6 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Beginning in 2017, other revenues includes the operations of Braker P III (\"BP III\"), a new subsidiary created at the end of 2016 to own and manage a commercial office building it acquired (Refer to Item 2. Properties in Part I of this filing for further discussion). Revenues associated with BP III were $1.5 million in 2017. Other revenues also includes the annual revaluation of fair value of the life interest in the Libbie Shearn Moody Trust.\nDerivative gain (loss) - Index options are derivative financial instruments used to hedge the equity return component of the Company's fixed-index products. Derivative gain or loss includes the amounts realized from the sale or expiration of the options. Since the index options do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under GAAP, they are marked to fair value on each reporting date and the resulting unrealized gain or loss is reflected as a component of net investment income.\nGains and losses from index options are substantially due to changes in equity market conditions. Index options are intended to act as hedges to match the returns on the product's underlying reference index and the rise or decline in the index relative to the index level at the time of the option purchase which causes option values to likewise rise or decline. As income from index options fluctuates with the underlying index, the contract interest expense to policyholder accounts for the Company's fixed-index products also fluctuates in a similar manner and direction. During 2017 and 2016, the reference indices increased and the Company recorded each year an overall gain from index options with a corresponding increase in contract interest expense in an amount relative to the gains recorded. In 2015, the reference indices decreased and an overall loss from index options was incurred and contract interest expense similarly declined.\nThe table below summarizes the derivative gain (loss) amounts and total contract interest by year.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(88,129\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gain (loss)\n</td> <td>148,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64,195\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gain (loss) included in net investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>222,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61,750\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contract interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>437,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe economic impact of option performance in the Company's financial statements is not generally determined solely by the option gain or loss included in net investment income as there is a corresponding amount recorded in the contract interest expense line. Rather, the Company's profitability with respect to these options is dependent upon the purchase cost of the option remaining within the financial budget for acquiring options embedded in the product pricing. Option prices vary with interest rates, volatility, and dividend yields among other things. As option prices vary, the Company manages for the variability by making offsetting adjustments to product caps, participation rates, and management fees. For the periods shown, the Company's option costs have been within the product pricing budgets.\nThe financial statement investment spread, the difference between investment income and interest credited to contractholders, is subject to variations from option performance during any given period. For example, many of the company's equity-index annuity products provide for the collection of asset management fees. These asset management fees are assessed when returns on expiring options are positive, and they are collected prior to passing any additional returns above the assessed management fees to the policy contractholders. During periods of positive returns, the collected asset management fees serve to increase the financial statement spread by increasing option realized gains reported as investment income in an amount greater than interest credited to policy contractholders which is reported as contract interest expense. Asset management fees collected in 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $31.8 million, $6.4 million, and $10.6 million, respectively.\nNet realized investment gains (losses) - Realized gains (losses) on investments include proceeds on bond calls and sales as well as impairment write-downs on investments in debt and equity securities and real estate. The net investment gains reported in 2017 consisted of gross gains of $15.0 million, primarily from calls of debt securities, offset by gross losses of $0.2 million, which included $0.1 million of other-than-temporary impairment losses. Included in the gross gains is approximately $2.3 million realized from a partial sale of the Company's previous home office land property to the Texas Department of Transportation to be used in the construction of roadway expansion.\nThe Company records impairment write-downs when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary and full recovery of the investment is not expected. Impairments due to credit factors are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings while non-credit (liquidity) impairment losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Impairment and valuation write-downs reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings are summarized in the following table.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment or valuation write-downs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equities\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEquity impairments (common stocks) represent a mark-to-market write-down on securities in which the market discount to book value was considered significant and had been maintained for several reporting periods. Equity securities represent 0.1% of invested assets and individual holdings have an average cost basis of approximately $43,000.\nBenefits and Expenses.

While death claim amounts are subject to variation from period to period, the Company's mortality experience has generally been consistent with or better than its product pricing assumptions. Mortality exposure is managed through reinsurance treaties under which the Company's retained maximum net amount at risk on any one life is capped at $500,000.\nLife and other policy benefits also includes policy liabilities held associated with the company's traditional life products, including riders. The increases in these liabilities were $17.9 million, $17.5 million, and $19.8 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. In 2016, the company recorded a prospective unlocking adjustment (see below) which included the company's withdrawal benefit rider (\"WBR\"), a component of these policy liabilities. The effect of this prospective unlocking was to decrease WBR reserves by $3.1 million which decreased life and other policy benefits by a like amount.\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs - Life insurance companies are required to defer certain expenses that vary with, and are primarily related to, the cost of acquiring new business. The majority of these acquisition expenses consist of commissions paid to agents, underwriting costs, and certain marketing expenses. Recognition of these deferred policy acquisition costs ( DPAC\u201d) as an expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements occurs over future periods in relation to the expected emergence of profits priced into the products sold. This emergence of profits is based upon assumptions regarding premium payment patterns, mortality, persistency, investment performance, and expense patterns. Companies are required to review universal life and annuity contract assumptions periodically to ascertain whether actual experience has deviated significantly from that assumed. If it is determined that a significant deviation has occurred, the emergence of profits pattern is to be \"unlocked\" and reset based upon the actual experience. DPAC balances are also adjusted each period to reflect current policy lapse or termination rates, expense levels and credited rates on policies as compared to anticipated experience ( true-up\u201d) with the adjustment reflected in current period amortization expense. In accordance with GAAP guidance, the Company must also write off deferred acquisition costs and unearned revenue liabilities upon internal replacement of certain contracts as well as annuitizations of deferred annuities.\nThe following table identifies the effects of unlocking adjustments on DPAC balances recorded through amortization expense separate from recurring amortization expense components for 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DPAC\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking adjustments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,857\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,810\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other amortization components\n</td> <td>126,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2017, the Company unlocked its DPAC balance for: (1) International life favorable mortality, better than expected persistency from disengaged countries, and enforcement of an interest rate clawback on certain universal life policies which collectively reduced amortization expense by $28.0 million; (2) Annuity surrender/annuitization assumptions and tighter crediting rate spreads which increased amortization by $15.1 million; and (3) Domestic and International life crediting rate spreads on certain equity-indexed universal life products which increased amortization expense by $1.1 million.\nDuring 2016, the Company unlocked its DPAC balance for: (1) favorable mortality in the Domestic life insurance segment resulting in reduced amortization expense by $8.2 million; (2) International life insurance favorable mortality, increased cost of insurance charges that had been implemented during the year, and higher lapse assumptions for policies associated with residents in \"disengaged countries\" (countries which the Company ceased accepting applications from residents in 2015) collectively decreasing DPAC amortization expense by $7.3 million; (3) updating surrender and annuitization rates on indexed, single tier, and two tier annuities which increased DPAC amortization expense by $3.7 million; and (4) updating DPAC future profit projections for universal life insurance riders which had not been previously included in software models which resulted in decreasing DPAC amortization expense by $2.1 million.\nIn 2015, the Company unlocked its DPAC balance for: (1) International Life for favorable mortality experience on one of its universal life products, the effect of which was to decrease DPAC amortization expense by $7.1 million; and (2) Annuity future expense assumptions pertaining to product development override costs (trailer commissions) which it is obligated to pay certain contracted National Marketing Organizations, the effect of which was to increase DPAC amortization expense by $5.3 million.\nAs the DPAC balance is an asset on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, GAAP provides for an earned interest return on the unamortized balance each period. The earned interest serves to increase the DPAC balance and reduce other amortization component expense. The rate at which the DPAC balance earns interest is the average credited interest rate on the company's universal life and annuity policies in force, including credited interest on equity-indexed policies. The amount of earned interest on DPAC balances recorded was $33.5 million, $10.5 million, and $20.5 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, decreasing other amortization component expense.\nUniversal life and annuity contract interest - The Company closely monitors credited interest rates on interest sensitive policies, taking into consideration such factors as profitability goals, policyholder benefits, product marketability, and economic market conditions. As long-term interest rates change, the Company's credited interest rates are often adjusted accordingly, taking into consideration the factors described above. The difference between yields earned on investments over policy credited rates is often referred to as the \"interest spread\".\nThe Company's approximated average credited rates, excluding and including equity-indexed products, were as follows:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Excluding fixed-index products)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Including fixed-index products)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity\n</td> <td>2.19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.43\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.97\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.66\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest sensitive life\n</td> <td>3.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.71\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.77\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContract interest reported in financial statements also encompasses the performance of the index options associated with the Company's fixed-index products. As previously noted, the market value changes of these derivative features resulted in net realized and unrealized gains (losses) in 2017, 2016 and 2015 of $222.9 million, $28.4 million and $(61.8) million, respectively. In 2017, this figure was comprised of unrealized gains totaling $74.6 million plus realized gains of $148.3 million. These positive returns similarly increase the average credited rates for the periods shown.\nGenerally, the impact of the market value change of index options on asset values aligns closely with the movement of the embedded\nderivative liability held for the Company's fixed-index products such that the net effect upon pretax earnings is negligible (i.e. net\nrealized and unrealized gains/(losses) included in net investment income approximate the change in contract interest associated with the corresponding embedded derivative liability change). However, other aspects of the embedded derivatives can cause deviations to occur between the change in index option asset values included in net investment income and the change in the embedded derivative liability included in contract interest. As noted in the discussion of net investment income, the collection of asset management fees in a period can cause investment income to increase marginally higher than contract interest expense. In addition, accounting rules require the embedded derivative liability to include a projection of asset management fees estimated to be collected in the next fiscal year. The change in this projection, plus or minus, is included in contract interest expense for the period being reported on. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, contract interest was increased/(decreased) by $6.9 million, ($15.9 million), and $2.0 million, respectively, for this occurrence. Refer to Note 15 Derivative Investments in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nContract interest expense also includes reserve changes for immediate annuities, two tier annuities, excess death benefits, excess\nannuitizations, and amortization of deferred sales inducement balances. These items are offset by policy charges assessed for policies having the withdrawal benefit rider. As changes in these items collectively impact contract interest expense, financial statement interest spread is also affected. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 the changes in these items increased contract interest expense by $38.1 million, $46.9 million, and $42.8 million, respectively.\nSimilar to deferred policy acquisition costs, the Company defers sales inducements in the form of first year credited interest bonuses on annuity products that are directly related to the production of new business. These bonus interest charges are deferred and amortized using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize other capitalized acquisition costs and the amortization is included in contract interest. In addition, deferred sales inducement balances are also reviewed periodically to ascertain whether actual experience has deviated significantly from that assumed (unlock) and are adjusted to reflect current policy lapse or termination rates, expense levels and credited rates on policies compared to anticipated experience (true-up). These adjustments, plus or minus, are included in contract interest expense.\nAs part of the DPAC balance unlockings previously discussed for 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company unlocked its deferred sales inducement balance. The effect of the prospective unlocking was to decrease the deferred sales inducement balance by $4.3 million, $1.7 million, and $1.8 million, in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and thereby increasing contract interest expense by a related amount for each period.\nIn addition to the unlockings of the DPAC and deferred sales inducement balances in 2016 and 2017, the Company unlocked its excess benefit reserves (International life) and two tier annuity reserves. As noted previously, changes in these items are also components of contract interest expense. The unlockings of these reserves increased contract interest expense by $13.7 million and $3.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOther operating expenses - Other operating expenses consist of general administrative expenses, licenses and fees, commissions not subject to deferral, nursing home expenses, real estate expenses and compensation costs. These are summarized in the table that follows.\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General insurance expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nursing home expenses\n</td> <td>16,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation expenses\n</td> <td>27,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commission expenses\n</td> <td>10,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate expenses\n</td> <td>2,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxes, licenses and fees\n</td> <td>11,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral insurance expenses include expenditures for software and amortization of previously capitalized information technology\nexpenditures. The Company has progressively released into production components of system development over the past couple of years initiating amortization of these capitalized costs. Software costs, including amortization expense, for 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $9.0 million, $8.6 million, and $3.3 million, respectively. General insurance expenses also include payments and provisions made relating to potential or contingent legal liabilities. Expenses related to these items were $8.5 million, $4.2 million, and $0.1 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The 2017 amount pertains to an $8.2 million loss contingency recorded by the Company at December 31, 2017 related to excess premiums on certain of its policies. The 2016 amount includes a $1.3 million payment (including interest and expenses) to insurance authorities in Brazil pertaining to administrative proceedings in that country and a $2.9 million provision for an annuity contract matter in Puerto Rico in litigation. Refer to the Legal Proceedings narrative in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K.\nNursing home expenses reflect the operations of the Company's two facilities in Reno, Nevada and San Marcos, Texas. The lower expense level in 2017 compared to the prior two years corresponds with decreased revenues from lower census figures and the resultant cost containment measures undertaken to manage profitability.\nCompensation expenses include share-based compensation costs related to outstanding vested and nonvested stock options and stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\"), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), and performance share units (\"PSUs\"). The related share-based compensation costs move in tandem not only with the number of awards outstanding but also with the movement in the market price of the Company's Class A common stock as a result of marking the stock options, SARs, and RSUs to fair value under the liability method of accounting. Consequently, the related expense amount varies positive or negative in any given period. For the three years shown, share-based compensation expense totaled $5.0 million in 2017, $7.9 million in 2016 and $(0.9) million in 2015. These expense levels reflect a change in the Company's Class A common share price from $269.25 at December 31, 2014 to $251.94 at December 31, 2015 to $310.80 at December 31, 2016 and to $331.02 at December 31, 2017. In addition to the changes in price of the Company's Class A common shares, there were 22,184 and 14,643 SARs granted to officers of National Western in 2017 and 2016. No awards of stock options or SARs were granted in 2015.\nReal estate expenses shown for 2017 pertain to the commercial building operated by Braker P III. The building was acquired at year-end 2016.\nTaxes, licenses and fees include premium taxes and licensing fees paid to state insurance departments, guaranty fund assessments, the Company portion of social security and Medicare taxes, state income taxes, and other state and municipal taxes. State income taxes are generally determined by apportioning the company's federal taxable income based upon premium generated from a particular state as a percentage of total premiums. Federal taxable income is derived from the company's statutory financial results. State income tax expense was $2.5 million, $0.7 million, and $0.5 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Premium tax expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $4.0 million, $2.6 million, and $2.9 million, respectively. The 2017 expense also includes withholding tax liabilities for international policy distributions not previously withheld on.\nSegment Operations\nSummary of Segment Earnings\nA summary of segment earnings from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is provided below.

insurance. Revenues from traditional products are simply premiums collected, while revenues from universal life insurance consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, policy administration fees, and surrender charges assessed during the period. A comparative detail of premiums and contract revenues is provided below.\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life insurance revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Traditional life insurance premiums\n</td> <td>5,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance premiums\n</td> <td>(8,916\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,019\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,135\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's domestic life insurance in force in terms of policy counts has been declining for some time. The pace of new policies issued has lagged the number of policies terminating from death or surrender by roughly a two-to-one rate over the past several years causing a declining level of insurance in force from which contract revenue is received. Consequently, the number of domestic life insurance policies in force has declined from 54,300 at December 31, 2015 to 51,600 at December 31, 2016 and to 50,200 at December 31, 2017. Policy lapse rates in 2017 decreased to 6.0% from 7.5% in 2016 and were approximately the same in 2015 at 5.9%.\nUniversal life insurance revenues are also generated with the issuance of new business based upon amounts per application and percentages of the face amount (volume) of insurance issued. The number of domestic policies issued during 2017 was 14% higher than in 2016 and the volume of insurance issued was 17% more than that in 2016.\nIn 2013 the Company began deferring the premium load on its highest selling domestic product, single pay life insurance. Amounts deferred are amortized into revenues over future periods corresponding with the duration of the policies. Initially, the premium load amounts deferred exceeded the amounts amortized back into revenues. However, in 2016 the cumulative amounts deferred reached a level such that the current year revenue amortization exceeds the current period deferral resulting in net increasing revenue from this accounting method.\nPremium dollars collected on universal life products are not reflected as revenues in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings in accordance with GAAP. Actual domestic universal life premiums collected are detailed below.\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life insurance:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First year and single premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Renewal premiums\n</td> <td>20,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the past several years the Company has achieved some success in growing its domestic life insurance business. Sales have been substantially weighted toward single premium policies which do not have much in the way of recurring premium payments. These products are targeting wealth transfer strategies involving the movement of accumulated wealth in alternative investment vehicles, including annuities, into life insurance products. As a result, renewal premium levels have not been exhibiting a corresponding level of increase.\nNet investment income for this segment of business, excluding derivative gain/(loss), has been gradually increasing due to the increased new business activity described above (single premium policies) and a higher level of investments needed to support the corresponding growth in policy obligations, especially those for single premium policies. The increase in net investment income has been partially muted by lower investment yields from debt security investment purchases during this time frame. Net investment income also includes the gains and losses on index options purchased to back the index crediting mechanism on fixed-index universal life products. A detail of net investment income for domestic life insurance operations is provided below.\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (excluding derivatives)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative gain (loss)\n</td> <td>37,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,014\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life insurance contract interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor liability purposes, the embedded option in the Company's policyholder obligations for this feature is bifurcated and reserved for separately. Accordingly, the impact for the embedded derivative component in the equity-index universal life product is reflected in the contract interest expense for each respective period.\nLife and policy benefits for a smaller block of business are subject to variation from period to period. Claim activity during 2017 was marginally higher than in 2016 and but in line with historical trends. The number of incurred claims in 2017 declined a fraction of 1% from the prior year, while the average net claim amount increased from $24,800 to $27,700. The low face amount per claim reflects the older block of domestic life insurance policies sold which were final expense type products (i.e. purchased to cover funeral costs). The increase in the average net claim amount reflects claims from more recent policy sales (single premium wealth transfer products) which have much higher face amounts of insurance coverage per policy. The Company's overall mortality experience for this segment has been better than pricing assumptions.\nAs noted previously in the discussion of results from Consolidated Operations, the Company records true-up adjustments to DPAC balances each period to reflect current policy lapse or termination rates, expense levels and credited rates on policies as compared to anticipated experience with the adjustment reflected in current period amortization expense. To the extent required, the Company may also record unlocking adjustments to DPAC balances. The following table identifies the effects of unlocking adjustments on domestic life insurance DPAC balances recorded through amortization expense separate from recurring amortization expense components for 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DPAC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking adjustments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other amortization components\n</td> <td>9,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs noted in the Consolidated Operations discussion, the Company unlocked the interest crediting rate spread on certain equity-indexed universal life products during"}
