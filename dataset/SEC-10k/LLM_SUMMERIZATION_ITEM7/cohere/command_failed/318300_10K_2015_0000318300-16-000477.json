The Federal Reserve Board had previously maintained its target Federal Funds Rate at a historically low level of 0% to 0.25% since December 2008 and had maintained the Discount Rate at 0.75% since December 2010.

It fell below 2% again in October and traded in a range between 2.13% and 2.34% during the last two months of the year. Overall, the Treasury yield curve steepened throughout the year with the 30-year bond yield ending 2015 roughly 25 basis points higher than at the beginning of the year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The impact of these transactions, where material, is discussed in the applicable sections of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accounting and reporting policies of Peoples conform to US GAAP and to general practices within the financial services industry. A summary of significant accounting policies is contained in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While all of these policies are important to understanding the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment and make estimates or assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the Consolidated Financial Statements could reflect different estimates or assumptions.\nManagement has identified the accounting policies described below as those that, due to the judgments, estimates and assumptions inherent in the policies, are critical to an understanding of Peoples' Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIncome Recognition\nInterest income on loans and investment securities is recognized by methods that result in level rates of return on principal amounts outstanding, including yield adjustments resulting from the amortization of loan costs and premiums on investment securities and accretion of loan fees and discounts on investment securities. Since mortgage-backed securities comprise a sizable portion of Peoples' investment portfolio, a significant increase in principal payments on those securities could impact interest income due to the corresponding acceleration of premium amortization or discount accretion.\nPeoples discontinues the accrual of interest on a loan when conditions cause management to believe collection of all or any portion of the loan's contractual interest is doubtful. Such conditions may include the borrower being 90 days or more past due on any contractual payments or current information regarding the borrower's financial condition and repayment ability. All unpaid accrued interest deemed uncollectable is reversed, which would reduce Peoples' net interest income. Interest received on nonaccrual loans is included in income only if principal recovery is reasonably assured.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nIn general, determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates by management. Peoples maintains an allowance for loan losses based on a quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio and estimation of the losses that are probable of occurrence within the loan portfolio. This formal analysis determines an appropriate level and allocation of the allowance for loan losses among loan types and the resulting recovery of or provision for loan losses by considering factors affecting losses, including specific losses, levels and trends in impaired and nonperforming loans; historical loan loss experience; current national and local economic conditions; volume; growth and composition of the portfolio; regulatory guidance and other relevant factors. Management\ncontinually monitors the loan portfolio through Peoples Bank's Credit Administration Department and Loan Loss Committee to evaluate the appropriateness of the allowance. The recovery or provision could increase or decrease each quarter based upon the results of management's formal analysis.\nThe amount of the allowance for loan losses for the various loan types represents management's estimate of probable losses from existing loans. Management evaluates lending relationships deemed to be impaired on an individual basis and makes specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses for each relationship based on discounted cash flows using the loan's initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans. For all other loans, management evaluates pools of homogeneous loans (such as residential mortgage loans, and direct and indirect consumer loans) and makes general allocations for each loan pool based upon historical loss experience. While allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans, the allowance is available for all loan losses.\nThe evaluation of individual impaired loans requires management to make estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans, which consist primarily of loans placed on nonaccrual status, restructured or internally classified as substandard or doubtful. These reviews are based upon specific quantitative and qualitative criteria, including the size of the loan, the loan cash flow characteristics, loan quality ratings, value of collateral, repayment ability of the borrower, and historical experience factors. Allowances for homogeneous loans are evaluated based upon historical loss experience, adjusted for qualitative risk factors, such as trends in losses and delinquencies, growth of loans in particular markets, and known changes in economic conditions in each lending market. As part of the process of identifying the pools of homogenous loans, management takes into account any concentrations of risk within any portfolio segment, including any significant industrial concentrations. Consistent with the evaluation of allowances for homogenous loans, the allowance relating to the Overdraft Privilege program is based upon management's monthly analysis of accounts in the program. This analysis considers factors that could affect losses on existing accounts, including historical loss experience and length of overdraft.\nThere can be no assurance the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover all losses, but management believes the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015 was adequate to provide for probable losses from existing loans based on information currently available. While management uses available information to estimate losses, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the loan portfolio, and the need for future additions to the allowance, will be based on changes in economic conditions and other relevant factors. As such, adverse changes in economic activity could reduce currently estimated cash flows for both commercial and individual borrowers, which would likely cause Peoples to experience increases in problem assets, delinquencies and losses on loans in the future.\nInvestment Securities\nPeoples' investment portfolio accounted for 26.7% and 27.8% of total assets at December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014 respectively, of which approximately 90% of the securities were classified as available-for-sale. Correspondingly, Peoples carries these securities at fair value on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. As a result, Peoples' Consolidated Balance Sheet may be sensitive to changes in the overall market value of the investment portfolio, due to changes in market interest rates, investor confidence and other factors affecting market values.\nWhile temporary changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities are not recognized in earnings, Peoples is required to evaluate all investment securities with an unrealized loss on a quarterly basis to identify potential other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) losses. This analysis requires management to consider various factors that involve judgment and estimation, including the duration and magnitude of the decline in value, the financial condition of the issuer or pool of issuers, and the structure of the security.\nUnder current US GAAP, an OTTI loss is recognized in earnings only when (1) Peoples intends to sell the debt security; (2) it is more likely than not that Peoples will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) Peoples does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security. In situations where Peoples intends to sell, or when it is more likely than not that Peoples will be required to sell the debt security, the entire OTTI loss must be recognized in earnings. In all other situations, only the portion of the OTTI losses representing the credit loss must be recognized in earnings, with the remaining portion being recognized in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of deferred taxes.\nManagement performed its quarterly analysis of the investment securities with an unrealized loss at December 31, 2015, and concluded no individual securities were other-than-temporarily impaired. Peoples has not recognized an impairment loss in 2015, 2014 or 2013.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nDuring 2015 and in prior years, Peoples recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, Peoples is required to allocate the cost of an acquired company to the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and liabilities assumed\nbased on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess cost over the fair value of net assets acquired and is not amortized but is tested for impairment when indicators of impairment exist, or at least annually. Peoples' other intangible assets consist of customer relationship intangible assets, including core deposit intangibles, representing the present value of future net income to be earned from acquired customer relationships with definite useful lives, which are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nThe value of recorded goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted and Peoples' ability to provide quality, cost-effective services in a competitive market place. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods. Potential goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of the reporting unit (as defined by US GAAP) is less than its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized in earnings only when the carrying amount of goodwill is less than its implied fair value.\nThe process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves highly subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of Peoples' reporting unit and, in some cases, goodwill itself. As a result, changes to these judgments, estimates and assumptions in future periods could result in materially different results.\nPeoples currently possesses a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. While quoted market prices exist for Peoples' common shares since they are publicly traded, these market prices do not necessarily reflect the value associated with gaining control of an entity. Thus, management takes into account all appropriate fair value measurements in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.\nThe measurement of any actual impairment loss requires management to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and separately identifiable intangible net assets (including unrecognized intangible assets) from the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of net tangible assets is calculated using the methodologies described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPeoples performs its required annual impairment test as of June 30 each year. The goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process that includes (1) determining if potential goodwill impairment exists and (2) measuring the impairment loss, if any. At June 30, 2015, management's analysis concluded that the estimated fair value of Peoples' single reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. The analysis also included an assessment of events and circumstances considering several key factors such as economic and local market conditions, overall financial performance, changes in management or key personnel, and share price.\nPeoples is required to perform interim tests for goodwill impairment in subsequent quarters if events occur or circumstances change that indicate potential goodwill impairment exists, such as adverse changes to Peoples' business or a significant decline in Peoples' market capitalization. At December 31, 2015, Peoples completed the interim test for goodwill, and due to potential indicators continued the analysis related to the first step of the goodwill impairment test. Peoples utilized the income approach and market approach analysis in determining that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount and that the goodwill of the reporting unit was not considered impaired. Therefore, Peoples did not complete the second step of the goodwill impairment test. For further information regarding goodwill, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPeoples records servicing rights ( SRs\u201d) in connection with its mortgage banking and small business lending activities, which are intangible assets representing the right to service loans sold to third-party investors. These intangible assets are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently amortized over the estimated life of the loans sold. SRs are stratified based on their predominant risk characteristics and assessed for impairment at the strata level at each reporting date based on their fair value. At December 31, 2015, management concluded no portion of the recorded SRs was impaired since the fair value equaled or exceeded the carrying value. However, future events, such as a significant increase in prepayment speeds, could result in a fair value that is less than the carrying amount, which would require the recognition of an impairment loss in earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded based on the liability method of accounting, which includes the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. In general, Peoples records deferred tax assets when the event giving rise to the tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nA valuation allowance is recognized to reduce any deferred tax asset that, based upon available information, it is more-likely-than-not all, or any portion, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Assessing the need for, and amount of, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires significant judgment and analysis of evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets. In most cases, the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon Peoples generating a sufficient level of taxable income in future periods, which can be difficult to predict. Peoples' largest\ndeferred tax assets involve differences related to Peoples' allowance for loan losses and accrued employee benefits. At December 31, 2015, management determined a valuation allowance would be recorded against the deferred tax assets associated with its investment in a partnership investment. No other valuation allowances were needed at either December 31, 2015 or 2014.\nThe calculation of tax liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment since it involves the application of complex tax laws that are subject to different interpretations by Peoples and the various tax authorities. Peoples' interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management's ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law.\nFrom time-to-time and in the ordinary course of business, Peoples is involved in inquiries and reviews by tax authorities that normally require management to provide supplemental information to support certain tax positions taken by Peoples in its tax returns. Uncertain tax positions are initially recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits was immaterial at both December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nManagement believes it has taken appropriate positions on its tax returns, although the ultimate outcome of any tax review cannot be predicted with certainty. Consequently, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the current and historical financial statements.\nFair Value Measurements\nAs a financial services company, the carrying value of certain financial assets and liabilities is impacted by the application of fair value measurements, either directly or indirectly. In certain cases, an asset or liability is measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis, such as available-for-sale investment securities. In other cases, management must rely on estimates or judgments to determine if an asset or liability not measured at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or whether a valuation reserve should be established. Given the inherent volatility, the use of fair value measurements may have a significant impact on the carrying value of assets or liabilities, or result in material changes to the consolidated financial statements, from period to period.\nDetailed information regarding fair value measurements can be found in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is a summary of those assets and liabilities that may be affected by fair value measurements, as well as a brief description of the current accounting practices and valuation methodologies employed by Peoples:\nAvailable-for-Sale Investment Securities\nInvestment securities classified as available-for-sale are measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis. For most securities, the fair value is based upon quoted market prices (Level 1) or determined by pricing models that consider observable market data (Level 2). For structured investment securities, the fair value often must be based upon unobservable market data, such as non-binding broker quotes and discounted cash flow analysis or similar models, due to the absence of an active market for these securities (Level 3). As a result, management's determination of fair value for these securities is highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions, which could change materially between periods. Management occasionally uses information from independent third-party consultants in its determination of the fair value of more complex structured investment securities. At December 31, 2015, all of Peoples' available-for-sale investment securities were measured using observable market data.\nAt December 31, 2015, the majority of the investment securities with Level 2 fair values were determined using information provided by third-party pricing services. Management reviews the valuation methodology and quality controls utilized by the pricing services in management's overall assessment of the reasonableness of the fair values provided. To the extent available, management utilizes an independent third-party pricing source to assist in its assessment of the values provided by its primary pricing services. Management reviews the fair values provided by these third parties on a quarterly basis and challenges prices when it believes a discrepancy in pricing exists. Based on Peoples' past experience, no discrepancies have been noted related to current pricing and values.\nImpaired loans\nFor loans considered impaired, the amount of impairment loss recognized is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is expected solely from the sale of the collateral. Management typically relies on the fair value of the underlying collateral due to the significant uncertainty surrounding the borrower's ability to make future payments. The vast majority of the collateral securing impaired loans is real estate, although the collateral may also include accounts receivable and equipment, inventory or similar personal property. The fair value of the collateral used by management represents the estimated proceeds to be received from the sale of the\ncollateral, less costs incurred during the sale, based upon observable market data or market value data provided by independent, licensed or certified appraisers.\nServicing Rights\nSRs are carried at the lower of amortized cost or market value, and, therefore, can be subject to fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis. SRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. Thus, management determines fair value based upon a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income provided by an independent third-party consultant. This valuation model is affected by various input factors, such as servicing costs, expected prepayment speeds and discount rates, which are subject to change between reporting periods. As a result, significant changes to these factors could result in a material change to the calculated fair value of SRs.\nTo determine the fair value of its servicing rights ( SRs\u201d) each reporting quarter, Peoples provides information representing loan information accompanied by escrow amounts to a third-party valuation firm. The third-party then evaluates the possible impairment of SRs as described below. Loans are evaluated on a discounted earnings basis to determine the present value of future earnings that Peoples expects to realize from the portfolio. Earnings are projected from a variety of sources including loan service fees, net interest earned on escrow balances, miscellaneous income and costs to service the loans. The present value of future earnings is the estimated fair value, calculated using consensus assumptions that a third-party purchaser would utilize in evaluating a potential acquisition of the SRs.\nEvents that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates and the related impact on mortgage loan prepayment speeds, and the payment performance of the underlying loans. Peoples believes this methodology provides a reasonable estimate. Mortgage loan prepayment estimates were determined through the application of the current dealer projected prepayment rates by product type and interest rate as published by Bloomberg, L.P. as of January 4, 2016, and adjusted for historical prepayment factors based on state, type of servicing, year of origination, and pass through coupon. The adjustable rate mortgage loan prepayment estimates were determined through the application of market trading assumptions as of January 4, 2016, and adjusted for historical prepayment factors based on state, type of servicing, year of origination, and pass through coupon.\nThese earnings are used to calculate the approximate cash flow that could be received from the servicing portfolio. Valuation results are provided quarterly to Peoples. At that time, Peoples reviews the information and SRs are marked to the lower of amortized cost or fair value for the current quarter.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $10.9 million, compared to $16.7 million in 2014 and $17.6 million in 2013, representing earnings per diluted common share of $0.61, $1.35 and $1.63, respectively. The decrease in earnings during 2015 was primarily driven by provision for loan losses of $14.1 million coupled with $11.3 million of acquisition-related costs. The decrease in 2014 from 2013 was primarily driven by acquisition-related costs of $5.1 million and pension settlement charges of $1.4 million. Earnings in 2013 were impacted by additional operating costs associated with various strategic investments to grow revenue and a lower recovery of loan losses.\nIn 2015, Peoples had a provision for loan losses of $14.1 million related primarily to the charge-off of one large commercial loan relationship coupled with loan growth and downward trends in criticized loans. Peoples recorded net charge-offs of $15.2 million for 2015, compared to net recoveries of $0.5 million and $3.7 million, respectively, for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The provision for or recovery of loan losses represented amounts needed, in management's opinion, to maintain the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.\nYear-over-year income and expense was largely effected by the acquisitions completed in 2014 and 2015. In 2014, Peoples acquired Midwest on May 30, Ohio Heritage on August 22, and North Akron on October 24, and in 2015, Peoples acquired NB&T on March 6. Due to the timing of the acquisitions, 2015 included a full year impact of the 2014 acquisitions compared to only a partial impact in 2014. In 2015, NB&T income and expenses were included beginning on March 6, 2015.\nNet interest income grew 40% to $97.6 million in 2015 compared to $69.5 million in 2014 and $55.4 million in 2013, mostly due to higher loan balances in connection with the recent acquisitions, coupled with organic loan growth. Net interest margin was 3.53% in 2015, higher than the 3.45% in 2014 and 3.23% in 2013. The increase in 2015 was due to accretion income from the completed acquisitions, organic loan growth, change in asset mix and a reduction in funding costs. Accretion income from acquisitions added approximately 17 basis points to net interest margin in 2015 compared to 13 basis points in 2014 and 4 basis points in 2013. The increase in net interest margin in 2014 was mostly due to higher loan balances in connection with acquisitions and organic loan growth. The decrease in net interest margin during 2013 was largely a result of the low interest rate environment, which put downward pressure on asset yields.\nTotal non-interest income, which excludes gains and losses on investment securities, asset disposals and other transactions, increased 18% in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased 8% comparing 2014 to 2013. During 2015, electronic banking income grew 35%, or $2.3 million, trust and investment income increased 25%, or $1.9 million, service charges on\ndeposit accounts grew 18%, or $1.7 million and bank owned life insurance income increased $0.5 million. The noted increases reflected a full year of income from the 2014 acquisitions and approximately nine months of income related to the NB&T acquisition.\nTotal other expense increased 35%, or $30.1 million, for the year ended December 31, 2015, due largely to a full year of expenses related to the 2014 acquisitions and approximately nine months of expenses related to the NB&T acquisition. The NB&T acquisition added 22 additional branches which increased net occupancy and equipment, higher salaries and employee benefits, due to additional employees, increased intangible asset amortization and increased electronic banking expense. Acquisition-related expenses included in other expenses during 2015 were $10.7 million, compared to $4.8 million in 2014 and $1.4 million in 2013.\nAt December 31, 2015, total assets were up 27%, or $691.2 million to $3.26 billion versus $2.57 billion at year-end 2014. The increase was primarily related to the acquisition of $710.5 million in assets during 2015. Excluding the impact of the loans acquired in the NB&T acquisition, loan balances grew 7% or $451.6 million for the year. The allowance for loan losses decreased $1.1 million to $16.8 million, or 1.19% of originated loans, net of deferred fees and costs, compared to $17.9 million and 1.48% at December 31, 2014. Total investment securities grew to $868.8 million, or 26.7% of total assets at December 31, 2015, compared to $713.7 million, or 27.8% of total assets at the prior year-end.\nTotal liabilities were $2.84 billion at December 31, 2015, up $611.5 million since December 31, 2014. Contributing to this increase were acquired deposits of approximately $629.5 million. Non-interest-bearing deposits comprised 28.7% of total retail deposits at December 31, 2015, versus 26.0% at year-end 2014. At December 31, 2015, total borrowed funds were $274.1 million, up $6.7 million compared to the prior year-end, as Peoples assumed $6.6 million from the NB&T acquisition.\nAt December 31, 2015, total stockholders' equity was $419.8 million, up $79.7 million from December 31, 2014. The increase in common stock within total stockholders' equity was primarily due to the common shares issued in connection with 2015 acquisition of NB&T which had a value of $76.0 million. Peoples' regulatory capital ratios remained significantly higher than \"well capitalized\" minimums. Peoples' Tier 1 Capital ratio decreased to 13.68% at December 31, 2015, versus 14.32% at December 31, 2014, while the Total Capital ratio was 14.55% versus 15.48% at December 31, 2014. In addition, Peoples' tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.69% and tangible book value per share was $14.68 at December 31, 2015, versus 9.39% and $15.57 at December 31, 2014, respectively. Additional information regarding capital requirements can be found in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInterest Income and Expense\nPeoples earns interest income on loans and investments and incurs interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income, the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense, remains Peoples' largest source of revenue. The amount of net interest income earned by Peoples is affected by various factors, including changes in market interest rates due to the Federal Reserve Board's monetary policy, the level and degree of pricing competition for both loans and deposits in Peoples' markets, and the amount and composition of Peoples' earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nPeoples monitors net interest income performance and manages its balance sheet composition through regular ALCO meetings. The asset-liability management process employed by the ALCO is intended to mitigate the impact of future interest rate changes on Peoples' net interest income and earnings. However, the frequency and/or magnitude of changes in market interest rates are difficult to predict, and may have a greater impact on net interest income than adjustments management is able to make.\nThe following table details Peoples' average balance sheets for the years ended December 31:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

pre-tax equivalent of taxable income using an effective tax rate of 35%. Management believes the resulting FTE net interest income allows for a more meaningful comparison of tax-exempt income and yields to their taxable equivalents. Net interest margin, which is calculated by dividing FTE net interest income by average interest-\nearning assets, serves as an important measurement of the net revenue stream generated by the volume, mix and pricing of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nThe following table details the calculation of FTE net interest income for the years ended December 31:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income, as reported\n</td> <td>97,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxable equivalent adjustments\n</td> <td>1,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fully tax-equivalent net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2015, Peoples recognized accretion income, net of amortization expense, from acquisitions of $4.8 million, which added approximately 17 basis points to net interest margin, compared to $2.6 million and 13 basis points, and $0.7 million and 4 basis points in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Also during 2015, additional interest income from prepayment fees and interest recovered on nonaccrual loans was $591,000 compared to $240,000 in 2014 and $976,000 in 2013. The primary driver of the increase in net interest income during 2015 was the higher loan balances resulting from organic growth and acquired loans.\nThe yield on investment securities decreased in 2015 as interest rates fell and prepayment speeds on mortgage-backed securities increased. The increase in prepayment speeds was due primarily to greater mortgage refinancing activity driven by lower interest rates. This resulted in higher monthly principal cashflows in the investment portfolio. In 2015, the average monthly principal cashflow was approximately $10.1 million compared to $6.0 million in 2014 and $8.0 million in 2013.\nFunding costs have declined since 2013 as Peoples executed a strategy of replacing higher-cost funding with low-cost deposits. In 2015, funding costs decreased 18 basis points, compared to15 basis points in 2014 and 27 basis points in 2013. Additional improvement was due to deploying excess cash on the balance sheet by buying securities in the investment portfolio and paying off a $12.0 million term loan. The continued increase in the balance of low-cost deposits has provided funding for loan growth during these periods.\nDetailed information regarding changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets can be found under appropriate captions of the FINANCIAL CONDITION\u201d section of this discussion. Additional information regarding Peoples' interest rate risk and the potential impact of interest rate changes on Peoples' results of operations and financial condition can be found later in this discussion under the caption Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity\u201d.\nProvision for (Recovery of) Loan Losses\nThe following table details Peoples' provision for (or recovery of) loan losses recognized for the years ended December 31:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for checking account overdrafts\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>356\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (recovery) of other loan losses\n</td> <td>13,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,766\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (recovery of) loan losses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,410\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percent of average total loans\n</td> <td>0.72\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.42\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe provision for (or recovery of) loan losses represents the amount needed to maintain the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses based on management's formal quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio and procedural methodology that estimates the amount of probable credit losses. This process considers various factors that affect losses, such as changes in Peoples' loan quality, historical loss experience and current economic conditions. The provision for loan losses recorded in 2015 was primarily due to the charge-off of one large commercial loan relationship coupled with organic loan growth and downward trends in criticized loans. The provision for loan losses recorded in 2014 was driven by checking account overdrafts, while the impact of increases in criticized loans was mitigated by $1.8 million of recoveries on three loans that were previously charged off. The recovery of loan losses recorded during 2013 was driven mostly by recoveries on commercial real estate loans that had previously incurred charge-offs.\nAdditional information regarding changes in the allowance for loan losses and loan credit quality can be found later in this discussion under the caption Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d.\nNet Loss on Asset Disposals and Other Transactions\nThe following table details the other (losses) gains for the years ended December 31 recognized by Peoples:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) gain on OREO\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(68\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) gain on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>(520\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss on bank premises and equipment\n</td> <td>(696\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(430\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(241\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on other assets\n</td> <td>(43\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss on asset disposals and other transactions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,788\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(431\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(155\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net loss on OREO during 2015 was due mainly to the sale of six OREO properties and the write-down of four OREO properties during the period. During the first quarter of 2015, Peoples recognized a loss on debt extinguishment from the prepayment of several FHLB advances. Net losses on bank premises and equipment during 2015, 2014 and 2013 included $575,000, $380,000 and $248,000, respectively, of asset write-offs associated with acquisition-related activity. The remaining net loss on bank premises and equipment in 2015 was attributable to the write-off of obsolete fixed assets and the write-down of closed office locations that were for sale. Peoples recognized a gain on debt extinguishment from a restructuring of acquired FHLB advances in 2014.\nNon-Interest Income\nPeoples generates non-interest income, which excludes gains and losses on investments and other assets, from five primary sources: insurance sales revenues, deposit account service charges, trust and investment activities, electronic banking ( e-banking\u201d), and mortgage banking. Peoples continues to focus on revenue growth from non-interest income sources in order to maintain a diversified revenue stream through greater reliance on fee-based revenues. As a result, total non-interest income accounted for 32.7% of Peoples' total revenues in 2015, compared to 36.6% in 2014 and 40.2% in 2013. The decline in Peoples' total non-interest income as a percent of total revenue during 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to increased net interest income from recent acquisitions.\nInsurance income comprised the largest portion of Peoples' non-interest income. The following table details Peoples' insurance income for the years ended December 31:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and casualty insurance commissions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance-based commissions\n</td> <td>1,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life and health insurance commissions\n</td> <td>1,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit life and A&H insurance commissions\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other fees and charges\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>207\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Insurance income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContinued increases in life and health insurance commissions over the past three years were the result of acquisitions and increased business. Performance-based commissions are typically recorded annually in the first quarter and are based on a combination of factors, such as loss experience of insurance policies sold, production volumes, and overall financial performance of the individual insurance carriers.\nService charges and other fees on deposit accounts, which are based on the recovery of costs associated with services provided, comprised a significant portion of Peoples' non-interest income. The following table details Peoples' deposit account service charges for the years ended December 31:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overdraft and non-sufficient funds fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Account maintenance fees\n</td> <td>2,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other fees and charges\n</td> <td>443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposit account service charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe amount of deposit account service charges, particularly fees for overdrafts and non-sufficient funds, is largely dependent on the timing and volume of customer activity. Peoples typically experiences a lower volume of overdraft and\nnon-sufficient funds fees annually in the first quarter attributable to customers receiving income tax refunds, while volumes generally increase in the fourth quarter in connection with the holiday shopping season. Management periodically evaluates its cost recovery fees to ensure they are reasonable based on operational costs and similar to fees charged in Peoples' markets by competitors. The yearly increases in account maintenance fees were the result of higher fees received on commercial accounts and rewards checking accounts.\nPeoples' fiduciary and brokerage revenues continue to be based primarily upon the value of assets under management. The following table details Peoples' trust and investment income for the years ended December 31:\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiduciary\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brokerage\n</td> <td>2,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trust and investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table details Peoples' managed assets at year-end December 31:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trust assets under management\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,275,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,022,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,000,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brokerage assets under management\n</td> <td>664,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>590,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>539,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total managed assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,939,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,612,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,539,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual average\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,859,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,576,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,446,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2015, the increase in fiduciary and brokerage revenues and managed assets was impacted by the acquisition of NB&T. Additionally, during 2015, 2014 and 2013, fiduciary income increased primarily due to higher managed asset account balances and retirement benefits plan income due to the addition of new plans. The U.S. financial markets also have an impact on managed assets. In recent years, Peoples has added experienced financial advisors in previously underserved market areas, and generated new business and revenue related to retirement plans for which it manages the assets and provides services.\nPeoples' e-banking services include ATM and debit cards, direct deposit services, internet and mobile banking, and serve as alternative delivery channels to traditional sales offices for providing services to clients. During 2015, electronic banking income grew $2.3 million, or 35% compared to 2014, due to acquisitions and a continued increase in the volume of debit card transactions. In 2015, Peoples' customers used their debit cards to complete $591 million of transactions, versus $467 million in 2014 and $416 million in 2013.\nMortgage banking income is comprised mostly of net gains from the origination and sale of long-term, fixed-rate real estate loans in the secondary market. As a result, the amount of income recognized by Peoples is largely dependent on customer demand and long-term interest rates for residential real estate loans offered in the secondary market. Mortgage banking income increased 6% in 2015 due to acquisitions and additional market areas, while decreasing 30% in 2014 due to slowed refinancing activity. In 2015, Peoples sold approximately $56.0 million of loans to the secondary market compared to $48.8 million in 2014 and $73.2 million in 2013.\nNon-Interest Expense\nYear-over-year expenses were largely effected by the acquisitions completed in 2014 and 2015.\nSalaries and employee benefit costs remain Peoples' largest non-interest expense, accounting for over half of the total non-interest expense. The following table details Peoples' salaries and employee benefit costs for the years ended December 31:\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base salaries and wages\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales-based and incentive compensation\n</td> <td>6,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee benefits\n</td> <td>6,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>1,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred personnel costs\n</td> <td>(1,593\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,396\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2,292\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll taxes and other employment costs\n</td> <td>4,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefit costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full-time equivalent employees:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actual at end of the period\n</td> <td>817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average during the period\n</td> <td>799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBase salaries and wages, employee benefits, payroll taxes and other employment costs increased in 2015, 2014 and 2013 due to completed acquisitions, additional operational staff and the addition of new sales talent in several markets, which significantly impacted the number of full-time equivalent employees. Peoples' sales-based and incentive compensation is tied to corporate incentive plans and commission from sales production. Sales-based and incentive compensation decreased in 2015, due primarily to corporate goals and incentives not being attained.\nThe increase in employee benefits as a result of acquisitions was partially offset by a decrease in pension settlement charges which were $0.5 million, $1.4 million and $0.3 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Effective March 1, 2011, Peoples froze the accrual of pension benefits, and since then, settlement charges have been largely based on the timing of retirements of plan participants and their election of lump-sum distributions. Under US GAAP, Peoples is required to recognize a settlement gain or loss when the aggregate amount of lump-sum distributions to participants equals or exceeds the sum of the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension cost. The amount of settlement gain or loss recognized is the pro rata amount of the unrealized gain or loss existing immediately prior to the settlement. Management anticipates continued pension settlement charges in future years as plan participants retire and elect lump-sum distributions from the plan.\nStock-based compensation is generally recognized over the vesting period, typically ranging from 6 months to 3 years. For all awards, expense is initially only recognized for the portion of awards that is expected to vest, and at the vesting date, an adjustment is made to recognize the entire expense for vested awards and reverse expense for non-vested awards. The majority of Peoples' stock-based compensation expense is attributable to annual equity-based incentive awards to employees, which are awarded in the first quarter and based upon Peoples achieving certain performance goals during the prior year. During 2015, Peoples granted restricted shares to non-employee directors, officers and key employees with performance-based vesting periods and time-based vesting periods. Stock-based compensation expense in 2015 was $1.8 million which included $792,000 of expense related to these awards, while the remaining expense recognized was for grants awarded in previous years. As it is probable that all outstanding performance-based vesting conditions will be satisfied, Peoples recorded the pro-rata expense for all outstanding performance-based awards in 2015, as required by US GAAP. Stock-based compensation expense in 2014 included $298,000 related to a one-time stock award of unrestricted common shares to all full-time and part-time employees who did not already participate in the equity plan. Additional information regarding Peoples' stock-based compensation plans and awards can be found in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeferred personnel costs represent the portion of current period salaries and employee benefit costs considered to be direct loan origination costs. These costs are capitalized and recognized over the life of the loan as a yield adjustment to interest income. As a result, the amount of deferred personnel costs for each year corresponds directly with the level of new loan originations. Additional information regarding Peoples' loan activity can be found later in this discussion under the caption Loans\u201d.\nPeoples' net occupancy and equipment expense for the years ended December 31 was comprised of the following:\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repairs and maintenance costs\n</td> <td>2,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net rent expense\n</td> <td>844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>925\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property taxes, utilities and other costs\n</td> <td>2,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net occupancy and equipment expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2015, Peoples acquired 22 new offices which resulted in higher depreciation, repairs and maintenance costs, and property taxes, utilities and other costs. In addition, Peoples completed renovations allowing for expanded service areas and efficiencies of operations. During 2014, Peoples acquired 12 new offices which resulted in higher depreciation, repairs and maintenance costs, and property taxes, utilities and other costs. In addition, Peoples completed the renovation of its branch network that began in 2013 and began renovation on newly-acquired branches. Management continues to monitor capital expenditures and explore opportunities to enhance Peoples' operating efficiency.\nProfessional fees expense represents the cost of accounting, legal and other third-party professional services utilized by Peoples, and increased 29% during 2015. The increase was primarily due to additional costs in relation to increased accounting guidance, yearly audits and executive search fees. Professional fees incurred as a result of acquisition-related activities were $1.7 million in 2015, compared to $2.0 million and $448,000 in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nPeoples' e-banking expense, which is comprised of bankcard, internet and mobile banking costs, increased in 2015, 2014 and 2013 due to additional accounts related to acquisitions, customers completing a higher volume of transactions using their debit cards and Peoples' internet banking service. These factors also produced a greater increase in the corresponding e-banking revenues over the same periods. Additionally, part of the increased e-banking expense in 2014 was due to increased debit card compromises at certain large retail companies.\nIn 2015, marketing expense, which includes advertising, donation and other public relations costs, increased $0.5 million due primarily to marketing associated with acquired branches and additional community donations in those markets. Marketing expense remained relatively flat in 2014 compared to 2013. Peoples contributed $350,000 in 2015, $300,000 in 2014 and $200,000 in 2013 to Peoples Bancorp Foundation Inc. Peoples formed this private foundation in 2004 to make charitable contributions to organizations within Peoples' primary market area. Future contributions to Peoples Bancorp Foundation Inc. will be evaluated on a quarterly basis, with the determination of the amount of any contribution based largely on the perceived level of need within the communities Peoples serves.\nPeoples is subject to state franchise taxes, which are based largely on Peoples Bank's equity at year-end, in the states where Peoples Bank has a physical presence. Franchise taxes increased during 2015 due to an increase in equity from the issuance of common shares related to acquisitions in 2014 and 2015. In Ohio, Peoples is subject to Ohio Financial Institution Tax (\"FIT\") which is a business privilege tax that is imposed on financial institutions organized for profit and doing business in Ohio. The FIT is based on the total equity capital in proportion to the taxpayer's gross receipts in Ohio.\nPeoples' intangible asset amortization expense is driven by acquisition-related activity, and increased to $4.1 million in 2015 compared to $1.4 million in 2014. The increase in 2015 relates to the completed NB&T acquisition in 2015 and recognition of a full year of amortization for acquisitions completed during 2014.\nData processing and software expense includes software support, maintenance and depreciation expense. These costs increased during 2015 and 2014 due to the recent acquisitions and new software projects completed.\nPeoples' FDIC insurance costs increased during 2015 and 2014 as a result of recent acquisitions. Additional information regarding Peoples' FDIC insurance assessments may be found in \"ITEM 1 - BUSINESS\" of this Form 10-K in the section captioned \"Supervision and Regulation\".\nPeoples' efficiency ratio, calculated as non-interest expense less amortization of other intangible assets divided by FTE net interest income plus non-interest income, was 75.50% for 2015, compared to 75.37% for 2014 and 71.90% for 2013. The increases in 2015 and 2014 were largely a result of one-time costs for acquisitions plus higher salaries and employee benefit costs.\nIncome Tax Expense\nA key driver of the amount of income tax expense or benefit recognized by Peoples each year is the amount of pre-tax income derived from tax-exempt sources. Additionally, Peoples receives tax benefits from its investments in tax credit funds, which reduce Peoples' effective tax rate. A reconciliation of Peoples' recorded income tax expense/benefit and effective tax rate to the statutory tax rate can be found in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPre-Provision Net Revenue\nPre-provision net revenue (\"PPNR\") has become a key financial measure used by federal bank regulatory agencies when assessing the capital adequacy of financial institutions. PPNR is defined as net interest income plus non-interest income minus non-interest expense and, therefore, excludes the provision for (recovery of) loan losses and all gains and losses included in earnings. As a result, PPNR represents the earnings capacity that can be either retained in order to build capital or used to absorb unexpected losses and preserve existing capital.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the amounts reported in Peoples' Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-Provision Net Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>14,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: net loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: net loss on loans held-for-sale and OREO\n</td> <td>529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>926\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: net loss on securities transactions\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: net loss on other assets\n</td> <td>739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: recovery of loan losses\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: net gain on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: net gain on loans held-for-sale and OREO\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: net gain on securities transactions\n</td> <td>729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>473\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: net gain on other assets\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Pre-provision net revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total average assets\n</td> <td>3,111,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,240,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,932,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,841,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,811,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-provision net revenue to total average assets\n</td> <td>0.96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2015, PPNR was higher while the pre-provision net revenue to total average assets ratio decreased compared to previous years due largely to the increase in net revenue as a result of the completion of the NB&T acquisition and recognition of a full year of revenue for acquisitions completed during 2014 being offset by the increase of average assets which also was reflective of the NB&T acquisition.\nEfficiency Ratio\nThe efficiency ratio is a key financial measure used to monitor performance. The efficiency ratio is calculated as total other expenses (less intangible amortization) as a percentage of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus non-interest income. This measure is non-GAAP since it excludes intangible amortization and all gains and/or losses included in earnings, and uses fully tax-equivalent net interest income.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the amounts reported in Peoples' consolidated financial statements for the periods presented:\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Efficiency ratio:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Amortization of other intangible assets\n</td> <td>4,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>586\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted total other expenses\n</td> <td>111,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>47,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>97,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Fully tax-equivalent adjustment\n</td> <td>1,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis\n</td> <td>99,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Efficiency ratio\n</td> <td>75.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>75.37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>71.90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>69.55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>68.98\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nPeoples considers cash and cash equivalents to consist of federal funds sold, cash and balances due from banks, interest-bearing balances in other institutions and other short-term investments that are readily liquid. The amount of cash and cash equivalents fluctuates on a daily basis due to customer activity and Peoples' liquidity needs. At December 31, 2015, excess cash reserves at the Federal Reserve Bank were $8.7 million, compared to $12.4 million at December 31, 2014. The amount of excess cash reserves maintained is dependent upon Peoples' daily liquidity position, which is driven primarily by changes in deposit and loan balances.\nIn 2015, Peoples' total cash and cash equivalents increased $9.7 million, as cash provided by Peoples' operating activities of $47.9 million was partially offset by cash used in financing activities of $37.1 million and investing activities of $1.1 million. Cash provided by investing activities from business combinations of $97.3 million was offset by activities in available-for-sale securities of $12.8 million and funded loan growth of $77.9 million. Within Peoples' financing activities, the decrease in interest-bearing deposits was tempered by an increase in non-interest bearing deposits of $99.3 million. The paydown of long-term borrowings of $72.4 million was substantially offset by an increase of $72.1 million in short term borrowings.\nIn 2014, Peoples' total cash and cash equivalents increased $7.6 million, as cash provided by Peoples' operating activities of $31.5 million was mostly offset by cash used by investing activities of $14.2 million and financing activities of $9.7 million. Cash provided by activities in available-for-sale securities and business combinations of $44.7 million, and $17.1 million, respectively, partially funded loan growth of $76.1 million. Within Peoples' financing activities, the decreases in interest-bearing deposits and short-term borrowings of $56.1 million were tempered by an increase in non-interest bearing deposits of $18.4 million and $40.2 million in proceeds from issuance of common shares.\nFurther information regarding the management of Peoples' liquidity position can be found later in this discussion under Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity.\u201d\nInvestment Securities\nThe following table provides information regarding Peoples' investment portfolio at December 31:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td>

approximately 26.7% of total assets compared to 27.8% at December 31, 2014, as Peoples continued to focus on reducing the relative size of the investment portfolio. Peoples acquired $156.4 million of investment securities as part of the NB&T acquisition, with the remaining fluctuation due to purchases being more than offset by principal paydowns, sales, calls and maturities.\nIn 2013, and throughout 2012, Peoples designated certain securities as \"held-to-maturity\" at the time of their purchase, as management made the determination Peoples would hold these securities until maturity and concluded Peoples had the ability to do so. Since then, Peoples has maintained the size of the held-to-maturity securities portfolio at approximately the same level. The unrealized gain or loss related to held-to-maturity securities does not directly impact stockholders' equity, in contrast to the impact from the available-for-sale securities portfolio.\nPeoples' investment in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities largely consists of securities either guaranteed by the U.S. government or issued by U.S. government sponsored agencies, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The remaining portions of Peoples' mortgage-backed securities consist of securities issued by other entities, including other financial institutions, which are not guaranteed by the U.S. government.\nThe amount of these non-agency\u201d securities included in the residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities totals above was as follows at December 31:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total amortized cost\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized gain\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(130\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement continues to reinvest the principal runoff from the non-agency securities in U.S agency investments, which has accounted for the continued decline in the fair value of these securities. At December 31, 2015, Peoples' non-agency portfolio consisted entirely of first lien residential mortgages, with nearly all of the underlying loans in these securities originated prior to 2004 and possessing fixed interest rates. Management continues to monitor the non-agency portfolio closely for leading indicators of increasing stress and will continue to be proactive in taking actions to mitigate such risk when

originated loans (excluding acquired loans) grew 17%, or $202.6 million, due to increases in all categories except deposit account overdrafts. Consumer loan balances, which consist mostly of loans to finance automobile purchases, have continued to increase in recent years due largely to Peoples placing greater emphasis on its consumer lending activity. The increase in total acquired loans in 2015 was due to the NB&T acquisition. At December 31, 2015, loans acquired from NB&T were approximately $333.8 million compared to $384.6 million at acquisition date.\nDuring 2014, total originated loans grew 12%, or $126.5 million, largely due to growth in commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and consumer loan balances. At December 31, 2014, loans acquired from Midwest, Ohio Heritage and North Akron were approximately $52.5 million, $166.6 million and $108.8 million, respectively. During 2013, total\noriginated loans increased 13%, while acquired loans grew $84.5 million due to the Ohio Commerce Bank acquisition. Also during 2013, Peoples retained a larger percentage of residential mortgage loans originated than in prior years which caused the increase in residential real estate loans.\nDuring 2013, Peoples placed greater emphasis on its consumer lending business, which primarily consists of automobile loans obtained directly or indirectly through automobile dealerships. Peoples added additional sales talent within this business line and established better relationships with dealers, resulting in substantially higher loan balances compared to prior years.\nThe following table details the maturities of Peoples' commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans at December 31, 2015:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Due in One Year or Less\n</td> <td>Due in One to Five Years\n</td> <td>Due After Five Years\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate, construction:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable\n</td> <td>51,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate, other:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable\n</td> <td>313,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>527,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>281,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>736,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable\n</td> <td>235,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>242,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>239,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>351,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoan Concentration\nPeoples categorizes its commercial loans according to standard industry classifications and monitors for concentrations in a single industry or multiple industries that could be impacted by changes in economic conditions in a similar manner.

In all other states, the aggregate outstanding balances of commercial loans in each state were less than $4.0 million at both December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe amount of the allowance for loan losses at the end of each period represents management's estimate of probable losses from existing loans based upon its formal quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio described in the Critical Accounting Policies\u201d section of this discussion. While this process involves allocations being made to specific loans and pools of loans, the entire allowance is available for all losses incurred within the loan portfolio. The following details management's allocation of the allowance for loan losses at December 31:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td>5,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial\n</td> <td>12,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate\n</td> <td>1,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home equity lines of credit\n</td> <td>732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>541\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>1,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>449\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposit account overdrafts\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Originated allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td>16,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchased credit impaired loan losses\n</td> <td>240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Acquired allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td>240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percent of originated loans, net of deferred fees and costs\n</td> <td>1.19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.58\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percent of originated loans decreased in 2015 from previous years as a result of the continuation of the reduction in historic loss rates over the past five years. Past years included historic periods dating closer to the recession which included larger charge-offs. Peoples also considers recent trends in criticized loans and loan growth associated with each loan portfolio, as well as qualitative factors that could negatively impact these trends, such as unemployment, rising interest rates, fragile real estate values, and plummeting oil and gas prices. Peoples believe the reserves remain appropriate to cover probable losses that exist in the current portfolio.\nThe reductions in the allowance for loan losses allocated to commercial real estate during 2015 and 2014 were driven by net recoveries in recent years reducing the historical loss rates. Increases in the commercial and industrial, home equity lines of credit and consumer categories of the allowance for loan losses were driven by net charge-off activity, and increases in the balances of the respective loan portfolios. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses allocated to residential real estate during 2015 was due to a reduction in net charge-off activity in recent years.\nThe significant allocations to commercial loans reflect the higher credit risk associated with these types of lending and the size of these loan categories in relationship to the entire loan portfolio. During 2015, Peoples experienced an increase of $56.8 million in criticized loans, which are those classified as watch, substandard or doubtful. Net charge-offs were elevated during 2015 as a result of the full charge-off of one large commercial loan relationship.\nThe allowance allocated to the residential real estate and consumer loan categories was based upon Peoples' allowance methodology for homogeneous pools of loans. The fluctuations in these allocations have been directionally consistent with the changes in loan quality, loss experience and loan balances in these categories.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended December 31:\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

deterioration since origination. Interest income on those loans is recognized on a level-yield method over the life of the loan.\nThe majority of Peoples' nonaccrual commercial real estate loans continued to consist of non-owner occupied commercial properties and real estate development projects. In general, management believes repayment of these loans is dependent on the sale of the underlying collateral. As such, the carrying values of these loans are ultimately supported by management's estimate of the net proceeds Peoples would receive upon the sale of the collateral. These estimates are based in part on market values provided by independent, licensed or certified appraisers periodically, but no less frequently than annually. Given the volatility in commercial real estate values, management continues to monitor changes in real estate values from quarter-to-quarter and updates its estimates as needed based on observable changes in market prices and/or updated appraisals for similar properties. The significant increases in nonaccrual commercial real estate loans during 2015 was a result of commercial real estate relationship in the skilled nursing sector being placed on nonaccrual status. The increase in nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans during 2014 was driven by a single $1.2 million relationship placed on nonaccrual. The significant decreases in nonaccrual status from 2011 to 2012 and 2013 was a result of the addition of a special assets group and their efforts in collecting and recovering payments on delinquent commercial loans.\nInterest income on loans classified as nonaccrual and renegotiated at each year-end that would have been recorded under the original terms of the loans was $0.4 million for 2015, $0.5 million for 2014 and $0.2 million for 2013. No portion of these amounts was recorded during 2015, 2014 or 2013, consistent with the income recognition policy described in the Critical Accounting Policies\u201d section of this discussion.\nOverall, management believes the allowance for loan losses was adequate at December 31, 2015, based on all significant information currently available. Still, there can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover future losses or that the amount of nonperforming loans will remain at current levels, especially considering the current economic uncertainty that exists and the concentration of commercial loans in Peoples' loan portfolio.\nDeposits\nThe following table details Peoples' deposit balances at December 31:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest-bearing deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>717,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>493,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>409,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>317,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>239,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing deposits:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail certificates of deposit\n</td> <td>448,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>432,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>363,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>392,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>411,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings accounts\n</td> <td>414,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>215,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money market deposit accounts\n</td> <td>394,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>337,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>275,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>264,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Governmental deposit accounts\n</td> <td>276,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing demand accounts\n</td> <td>250,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brokered certificates of deposits\n</td> <td>33,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest-bearing deposits\n</td> <td>1,818,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,439,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,170,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,175,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,111,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,535,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,933,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,580,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,492,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,351,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in governmental deposit accounts was due to fluctuations of balances held by state and local governmental entities and their cash flow needs. Peoples also maintained its deposit strategy of growing low-cost core deposits, such as checking and savings accounts, and reducing its reliance on higher-cost, non-core deposits, such as CDs and brokered deposits. These actions accounted for much of the changes in deposit balances. Some of the increase in deposit balances was due to the NB&T acquisition, which included non-interest bearing deposits of $177.2, retail CDs totaling $48.0 million, savings accounts of $88.3 million, money market deposit accounts of $64.6 million, governmental deposit accounts of $104.8 million, and interest-bearing demand accounts of $57.9 million at December 31, 2015.\nThe increase in total deposits in 2014, included the Midwest, Ohio Heritage and North Akron acquisitions which added an aggregate of $5.5 million of non-interest-bearing deposits, $105.0 million of CDs, $53.1 million of savings accounts, $165.1 million of money market deposit accounts, $2.1 million of governmental deposit accounts and $1.0 million of interest-bearing demand accounts at December 31, 2014.\nPeoples' governmental deposit accounts represent savings and interest-bearing transaction accounts from state and local governmental entities. These funds are subject to periodic fluctuations based on the timing of tax collections and subsequent expenditures or disbursements. Peoples normally experiences an increase in balances annually during the first quarter corresponding with tax collections, with declines normally in the second half of each year corresponding with expenditures by the governmental entities. While these balances have increased since 2008, Peoples continues to emphasize growth of low-cost deposits that do not require Peoples to pledge assets as collateral, which is required in the case of governmental deposit accounts.\nThe maturities of retail CDs with total balances of $250,000 or more at December 31 were as follows:\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3 months or less\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 3 to 6 months\n</td> <td>9,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 6 to 12 months\n</td> <td>9,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 12 months\n</td> <td>24,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowed Funds\nThe following table details Peoples' short-term and long-term borrowings at December 31:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term borrowings:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB advances\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>84,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td>160,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term borrowings:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB advances\n</td> <td>66,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Callable national market repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term note payable (parent company)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debentures held by subsidiary trust\n</td> <td>6,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term borrowings\n</td> <td>113,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total borrowed funds\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>267,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPeoples' short-term FHLB advances generally consist of overnight borrowings being maintained in connection with the management of Peoples' daily liquidity position. During 2015, Peoples repaid approximately $52.1 million of long-term FHLB advances during 2015 and recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $520,000.\nDuring 2015, Peoples increased its usage of short-term FHLB advances due to the decrease and pre-payment of long-term debt. During 2014, Peoples had reduced its usage of short-term FHLB advances due to acquiring long-term FHLB advances from Ohio Heritage. Peoples' retail repurchase agreements consist of overnight agreements with commercial customers and serve as a cash management tool. Additionally, in 2015, Peoples acquired subordinated debt in the NB&T acquisition.\nDuring 2012, Peoples entered into a loan agreement that was subsequently amended in 2014 (as amended, \"Amended Loan Agreement\"), and Peoples is subject to certain covenants imposed by this Amended Loan Agreement. At December 31, 2015, Peoples was in compliance with the applicable covenants.\nAdditional information regarding Peoples' borrowed funds can be found in Note 8 and Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital/Stockholders' Equity\nDuring 2015, Peoples' total stockholders' equity increased primarily due to $76.0 million of common equity issued in connection with the NB&T acquisition. Regulatory capital ratios continued to fluctuate due to recent acquisitions. At December 31, 2015, capital levels for both Peoples and Peoples Bank remained substantially higher than the minimum amounts needed to be considered \"well capitalized\" under banking regulations. These higher capital levels reflect Peoples' desire to maintain strong capital positions to provide greater flexibility to grow the Company. Also during the first quarter of 2015, Peoples adopted the new Basel III regulatory capital framework, as approved by the federal banking regulators. The adoption of this new framework modified the calculations and well capitalized thresholds of the current capital ratios and added the new Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio. Additionally, under the new rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, Peoples must hold a capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in from 0.00% for 2015 to 2.50% by 2019.\nThe following table details Peoples' actual risk-based capital levels and corresponding ratios at December 31:\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Amounts:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common Equity Tier 1\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>288,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1\n</td> <td>295,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (Tier 1 and Tier 2)\n</td> <td>313,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>261,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,157,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,687,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,338,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,141,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,111,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Ratios:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common Equity Tier 1\n</td> <td>13.37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1\n</td> <td>13.68\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>14.32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>12.42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>14.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>14.86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (Tier 1 and Tier 2)\n</td> <td>14.55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>15.48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>13.78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>15.43\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>16.20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 leverage\n</td> <td>9.52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>9.92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>8.52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>8.83\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>9.45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to traditional capital measurements, management uses tangible capital measures to evaluate the adequacy of Peoples' stockholders' equity. Such ratios represent non-GAAP financial information since their calculation removes the impact of intangible assets acquired through acquisitions on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes this information is useful to investors since it facilitates the comparison of Peoples' operating performance, financial condition and trends to peers, especially those without a similar level of intangible assets to that of Peoples. Further, intangible assets generally are difficult to convert into cash, especially during a financial crisis, and could decrease substantially in value should there be deterioration in the overall franchise value. As a result, tangible equity represents a conservative measure of the capacity for a company to incur losses but remain solvent.\nThe following table reconciles the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures to amounts reported in Peoples' Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible Equity:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total stockholders' equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>419,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>221,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>221,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>206,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: goodwill and other intangible assets\n</td> <td>149,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>270,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>230,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible Assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,258,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,567,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,059,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,918,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,794,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: goodwill and other intangible assets\n</td> <td>149,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,109,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,458,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,981,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,849,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,729,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible Book Value per Share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible common equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>270,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>230,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common shares outstanding\n</td> <td>18,404,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,836,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,605,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,547,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,507,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible book value per share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible Equity to Tangible Assets Ratio:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>270,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>230,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,109,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,458,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,981,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,849,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,729,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible equity to tangible assets\n</td> <td>8.69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>9.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>7.26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>8.28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>8.22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in tangible equity to tangible assets ratio at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014 was due to the impact of assets acquired in the NB&T acquisition as well as a reduction in retained earnings as most of the net income was paid to common shareholders as dividends.\nIn 2014, Peoples' tangible equity to tangible assets ratio increased significantly due to recent acquisitions, in which common shares represented a portion of the consideration, and the Private Equity Issuance. The reduction in 2013 was due to\nthe impact of assets acquired in the Ohio Commerce Bank acquisition, which was funded solely by cash consideration, as well as reductions in the fair value of the available-for-sale investment securities.\nFuture Outlook\nIn 2015, Peoples completed its largest bank acquisition to date, and incurred a large provision for loan losses attributable primarily to one large commercial relationship. The first half of 2015 was a challenge for Peoples as there was minimal loan growth and expenses were elevated, due in part to the acquisition costs incurred associated with the NB&T acquisition. During the second half of 2015, Peoples showed improvement as loan growth was strong and expenses were managed; however, these positives were largely overshadowed by the large provision for loan losses that was taken due to the one large commercial relationship.\nFor 2016, Peoples will build off the momentum that was gained in the second half of 2015 related to loan growth and expense management. Key strategic priorities continue to include generating positive operating leverage, maintaining superior asset quality, and remaining prudent with the use of capital. Overall, Peoples' key strategic objectives are to be a steady, dependable performer for its shareholders and to take advantage of market expansion opportunities. Peoples' long-term strategic goals include generating results in the top quartile of performance relative to Peoples' peer group, as defined in the Proxy Statement, and providing returns for its shareholders superior to those of its peers, regardless of operating conditions.\nNet interest income remains a major source of revenue for Peoples. Thus, Peoples' ability to grow revenue in 2016 will be impacted by the amount of net interest income generated. The current outlook is mixed as to whether the Federal Reserve Board will continue to raise interest rates throughout 2016. Long-term rates could increase but remain more volatile than in prior years. Changes in long-term interest rates would affect reinvestment rates within the loan and investment portfolios. Should the yield curve flatten, Peoples would have limited opportunities to offset the impact on asset yields with a similar reduction in funding costs. Thus, Peoples' ability to produce meaningful loan growth remains the key driver for improving net interest income and margin in 2016.\nNet interest margin for 2016 is expected to remain stable in the low 3.50%'s given the interest rate environment. Loan growth will again be the key driver in stabilizing asset yields. The net accretion income impact on net interest margin is expected to be slightly less than that experienced in 2015.\nManagement would expect both net interest income and margin to benefit from any meaningful increase in market interest rates based upon the current interest rate risk profile. However, it remains inherently difficult to predict and manage the future trend of Peoples' net interest income and margin due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing and magnitude of future interest rate changes, as well as the impact of competition for loans and deposits.\nPeoples continues to seek to maintain a diversified revenue stream though its strong fee-based businesses, such as insurance and wealth management. In 2015, Peoples' fee revenue comprised 33% of its total revenue, down from 37% in 2014 and 40% in 2013. The decline in recent years was due primarily to the four bank acquisitions completed during 2014 and 2015, only one of which had a wealth management practice, and only two relatively small insurance agencies were purchased during the same period of time. Peoples has capabilities that many banks in its market area lack, including some of the largest national banks, which include robust retirement plan services and comprehensive insurance products. Thus, management considers Peoples to have a competitive advantage that directly enhances revenue growth potential. For 2016, acquisition activity will be focused primarily on growing fee-based businesses as management continues to strive for a diversified revenue stream that consists of 35% to 40% fee-based revenue to total revenue.\nWhile the primary focus will be on revenue growth, management remains disciplined with operating expenses. In 2015, total non-interest expense included $10.7 million of one-time acquisition costs. For 2016, total non-interest expense will increase due to a full year's impact of the NB&T acquisition. Normalizing for these items, management expects expense growth to be in the low single digits in 2016. However, Peoples continues to have limited control over some expenses, such as employee medical and pension costs. Peoples continues to be exposed to more pension settlement charges given the frozen status of its defined benefit plan. The recognition of settlement charges is largely dependent upon the timing of distributions, the amount of pension benefit earned by the retirees, and whether the individuals elect a lump-sum distribution. For 2016, management anticipates a comparable volume of settlement charges to that incurred in 2015. This expectation is based on normal retirement activity within the defined benefit plan, but assumes all potential distributions are lump sum payouts.\nNormalizing 2015 for a full year impact of the NB&T acquisition, and excluding the acquisition costs incurred in 2015, management expects 4% to 6% growth in total revenue in 2016, and the low-single digit percentage expense growth. As a result, Peoples' efficiency ratio is expected to be below 65% for 2016.\nA key to Peoples' 2016 revenue growth goal is achieving meaningful loan growth. Management believes period-end loan balances could increase by 6% to 8% in 2016. Within Peoples' commercial lending activity, the primary emphasis continues to be on non-mortgage commercial lending opportunities and capitalizing on growth opportunities provided by the acquisitions completed. As a result, commercial and industrial loan balances should increase at a greater rate than commercial real estate loan balances. Consumer lending activity is continuing to strengthen and will remain a larger contributor to overall loan growth, primarily indirect lending.\nIn 2015, Peoples invested $50 million of excess cash in the investment portfolio, resulting in the investment portfolio comprising 27% of total assets as of December 31, 2015. In 2016, the investment portfolio to anticipated to comprise between 25% and 27% of total assets. Management can use the cash flow generated by Peoples' significant investment in mortgage-backed securities to fund new loan production. Peoples will continue to seek opportunities to execute a shift in the mix on the asset side of the balance sheet to reduce the relative size of the investment portfolio allowing Peoples to fund the expected loan growth. Management may adjust the size or composition of the investment portfolio in response to other factors, such as changes in liquidity needs and interest rate conditions.\nPeoples' funding strategy continues to emphasize growth of core deposits, such as checking and savings accounts, rather than higher-cost deposits. Thus, CD balances could maintain the declining trend experienced in recent years. Given the expected increase in earning assets, borrowed funds would increase in 2016 to the extent earning asset growth is more than deposit growth. Should this occur, management would evaluate using longer-term borrowings to match the duration of the assets being funded to minimize the long-term interest rate risk.\nPeoples remains committed to sound underwriting and prudent risk management. Management believes this credit discipline will benefit Peoples during future economic downturns. The long-term goal is to maintain key metrics in the top-quartile of Peoples' peer group regardless of economic conditions. Net charge-off trends are expected to normalize in 2016 as the prospects of large charge-offs and recoveries diminish. Management anticipates Peoples' provision for loan losses and the net charge-off rate for 2016 to normalize, with the net charge-off rate near the low end of its long-term historical range of 0.20% to 0.30% of average loans. For 2016, management intends to remain prudent with the level of Peoples' allowance for loan losses. However, the level will continue to be based upon management's quarterly assessment of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio, and the amount of any provision for loan losses should be driven mostly by a combination of the net charge-off rate and loan growth.\nPeoples' capital position remains strong. Given the excess capital position and the anticipated pause in bank acquisitions, Peoples will continue to look for ways to effectively manage its capital. Late in 2015, Peoples approved a share repurchase program of up to $20 million. Given the activity in the stock market in early 2016, specifically as it related to the price of Peoples' common shares, purchases were executed under the program in January and February, totaling $4.5 million. Peoples will continue to evaluate additional purchase opportunities throughout 2016.\nManagement has built a culture where it is paramount that the associates take care of customers and take care of each other. Management is committed to profitable growth of the company and building long-term shareholder value. This will require management to remain focused on four key areas: responsible risk management; extraordinary client experience; profitable revenue growth; and maintaining a superior workforce. Success will be achieved through disciplined execution of strategies and providing extraordinary service to Peoples' clients and communities.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity\nWhile Peoples is exposed to various business risks, the risks relating to interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are major risks that can materially impact future results of operations and financial condition due to their complexity and dynamic nature. The objective of Peoples' asset/liability management ( ALM\u201d) function is to measure and manage these risks in order to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy, liquidity and safety. This objective requires Peoples to focus on interest rate risk exposure and adequate liquidity through its management of the mix of assets and liabilities, their related cash flows and the rates earned and paid on those assets and liabilities. Ultimately, the ALM function is intended to guide management in the acquisition and disposition of earning assets and selection of appropriate funding sources.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk ( IRR\u201d) is one of the most significant risks arising in the normal course of business of financial services companies like Peoples. IRR is the potential for economic loss due to future interest rate changes that can impact the earnings stream as well as market values of financial assets and liabilities. Peoples' exposure to IRR is due primarily to differences in the maturity or repricing of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, other factors, such as prepayments of loans and investment securities or early withdrawal of deposits, can affect Peoples' exposure to IRR and increase interest costs or reduce revenue streams.\nPeoples has assigned overall management of IRR to the ALCO, which has established an IRR management policy that sets minimum requirements and guidelines for monitoring and managing the level of IRR. The objective of Peoples' IRR policy is to assist the ALCO in its evaluation of the impact of changing interest rate conditions on earnings and economic value of equity, as well as assist with the implementation of strategies intended to reduce Peoples' IRR. The management of IRR involves either maintaining or changing the level of risk exposure by changing the repricing and maturity characteristics of the cash flows for specific assets or liabilities. Additional oversight of Peoples' IRR is provided by the Asset Liability Management and Investment Committee of Peoples Bank's Board of Directors. This committee also reviews and approves Peoples' IRR management policy at least annually.\nThe ALCO uses various methods to assess and monitor the current level of Peoples' IRR and the impact of potential strategies or other changes. However, the ALCO predominantly relies on simulation modeling in its overall management of IRR since it is a dynamic measure. Simulation modeling also estimates the impact of potential changes in interest rates and balance sheet structures on future earnings and projected economic value of equity.\nThe modeling process starts with a base case simulation using the current balance sheet and current interest rates held constant for the next twenty-four months. Alternate scenarios are prepared which simulate the impact of increasing and decreasing market interest rates, assuming parallel yield curve shifts. Comparisons produced from the simulation data, showing the changes in net interest income from the base interest rate scenario, illustrate the risks associated with the current balance sheet structure. Additional simulations, when deemed appropriate or necessary, are prepared using different interest rate scenarios from those used with the base case simulation and/or possible changes in balance sheet composition. The additional simulations include non-parallel shifts in interest rates whereby the direction and/or magnitude of change of short-term interest rates is different than the changes applied to longer-term interest rates. Comparisons showing the earnings and economic value of equity variance from the base case are provided to the ALCO for review and discussion.\nThe ALCO has established limits on changes in the twelve-month net interest income forecast and the economic value of equity from the base case. The ALCO may establish risk tolerances for other parallel and non-parallel rate movements, as deemed necessary.\nThe following table details the current policy limits used to manage the level of Peoples' IRR:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Immediate and Sustained Shift in Interest Rates\n</td> <td>Net Interest Income\n</td> <td>Economic Value of Equity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> + / - 100 basis points\n</td> <td>-5%\n</td> <td>-10%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> + / - 200 basis points\n</td> <td>-10%\n</td> <td>-15%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> + / - 300 basis points\n</td> <td>-15%\n</td> <td>-20%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the estimated changes in net interest income and the economic value of equity based upon a standard, parallel shock analysis (dollars in thousands):\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in Interest Rate\n</td> <td>Estimated Increase in\nNet Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated (Decrease) Increase in Economic Value of Equity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in Basis Points)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>300\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(88,774\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(66,730\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(15.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>200\n</td> <td>1,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57,205\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41,537\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(9.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>100\n</td> <td>1,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,036\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,026\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis table uses a standard, parallel shock analysis for assessing the IRR to net interest income and the economic value of equity. A parallel shock means all points on the yield curve (one year, two year, three year, etc.) are directionally changed the same amount of basis points. For example, 100 basis points equals 1%. While management\nregularly assesses the impact of both increasing and decreasing interest rates, the table above only reflects the impact of upward shocks due to the fact a downward parallel shock of 100 basis points or more is not possible given that most short-term rates are currently less than 1%.\nAlthough a parallel shock table can give insight into the current direction and magnitude of IRR inherent in the balance sheet, interest rates do not usually move in a complete parallel manner during interest rate cycles. These nonparallel movements in interest rates, commonly called yield curve steepening or flattening movements, tend to occur during the beginning and end of an interest rate cycle, with differences in the timing, direction and magnitude of changes in short-term and long-term interest rates. Thus, any benefit that could occur as a result of the Federal Reserve Board increasing short-term interest rates in future quarters could be offset by an inverse movement in long-term interest rates. As a result, management conducts more advanced interest rate shock scenarios to gain a better understanding of Peoples' exposure to nonparallel rate shifts.\nAt December 31, 2015, Peoples' Consolidated Balance Sheet remained positioned for a rising interest rate environment, as illustrated by the potential increase in net interest income shown in the above table. During 2015, Peoples became slightly sensitive to rising interest rates (as measured by the expected percentage change in economic value of equity) due to several factors. The largest factors impacting Peoples' interest rate sensitivity were the NB&T acquisition in March and the deployment of excess cash in the balance sheet post-acquisition.\nLiquidity\nIn addition to IRR management, another major objective of the ALCO is to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity. The ALCO defines liquidity as the ability to meet anticipated and unanticipated operating cash needs, loan demand and deposit withdrawals without incurring a sustained negative impact on profitability.\nA primary source of liquidity for Peoples is retail deposits. Liquidity is also provided by cash generated from earning assets such as maturities, calls, and principal and interest payments from loans and investment securities. Peoples also uses various wholesale funding sources to supplement funding from customer deposits. These external sources provide Peoples with the ability to obtain large quantities of funds in a relatively short time period in the event of sudden unanticipated cash needs. However, an over-utilization of external funding sources can expose Peoples to greater liquidity risk as these external sources may not be accessible during times of market stress. Additionally, Peoples may be exposed to the risk associated with providing excess collateral to external funding providers, commonly referred to as counterparty risk. As a result, the ALCO's liquidity management policy sets limits on the net liquidity position and the concentration of non-core funding sources, both wholesale funding and brokered deposits.\nIn addition to external sources of funding, Peoples considers certain types of deposits to be less stable or \"volatile funding\". These deposits include special money market products, large CDs and public funds. Peoples has established volatility factors for these various deposit products, and the liquidity management policy establishes a limit on the total level of volatile funding. Additionally, Peoples measures the maturities of external sources of funding for periods of 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months and has established policy limits for the amounts maturing in each of these periods. The purpose of these limits is to minimize exposure to what is commonly termed rollover risk.\nAn additional strategy used by Peoples in the management of liquidity risk is maintaining a targeted level of liquid assets. These are assets that can be converted into cash in a relatively short period of time. Management defines liquid assets as unencumbered cash (including cash on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank), and the market value of U.S. government and agency securities that are not pledged. Excluded from this definition are pledged securities, non-government and agency securities, municipal securities and loans. Management has established a minimum level of liquid assets in the liquidity management policy, which is expressed as a percentage of loans and unfunded loan commitments. Peoples also has established a policy limit around the level of liquefiable assets also expressed as a percentage of loans and unfunded loan commitments. Liquefiable assets are defined as liquid assets plus the market value of unpledged securities not included in the liquid asset measurement.\nAn essential element in the management of liquidity risk is a forecast of the sources and uses of anticipated cash flows. On a monthly basis, Peoples forecasts sources and uses of cash for the next twelve months. To assist in the management of liquidity, management has established a liquidity coverage ratio, which is defined as the total sources of cash divided by the total uses of cash. A ratio of greater than 1.0 times indicates that forecasted sources of cash are adequate to fund forecasted uses of cash. The liquidity management policy establishes a minimum limit of 1.0 times. As of December 31, 2015, Peoples had a ratio of 1.8 times, which was within policy limits. Peoples also forecasts secondary or contingent sources of cash, and this includes external sources of funding and liquid assets. These sources of cash would be required if and when the forecasted liquidity coverage ratio dropped below the policy limit of 1.0 times. An additional liquidity measurement used by management includes the total forecasted sources of cash and the\ncontingent sources of cash divided by the forecasted uses of cash. Management has established a minimum ratio of 3.0 times for this liquidity management policy limit. As of December 31, 2015, Peoples had a ratio of 7.4 times, which was within policy limits.\nDisruptions in the sources and uses of cash can occur which can drastically alter the actual cash flows and negatively impact Peoples' ability to access internal and external sources of cash. Such disruptions might occur due to increased withdrawals of deposits, increases in the funding required for loan commitments, a decrease in the ability to access external funding sources and other forces that would increase the need for funding and limit Peoples' ability to access needed funds. As a result, Peoples maintains a liquidity contingency funding plan (\"LCFP\") that considers various degrees of disruptions and develops action plans around these scenarios.\nPeoples' LCFP identifies scenarios where funding disruptions might occur and creates scenarios of varying degrees of severity. The disruptions considered include an increase in funding of unfunded loan commitments, unanticipated withdrawals of deposits, decreases in the renewal of maturing CDs and reductions in cash earnings. Additionally, the LCFP creates stress scenarios where access to external funding sources, or contingency funding, is suddenly limited which includes a significant increase in the margin requirements where securities or loans are pledged, limited access to funding from other banks and limited access to funding from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank. Peoples' LCFP scenarios include a base scenario, a mild stress scenario, a moderate stress scenario and a severe stress scenario. Each of these is defined as to the severity, and action plans are developed around each.\nLiquidity management also requires the monitoring of risk indicators that may alert the ALCO to a developing liquidity situation or crisis. Early detection of stress scenarios allows Peoples to take actions to help mitigate the impact to Peoples Bank's business operations. The LCFP contains various indicators, termed key risk indicators (\"KRI's\") that are monitored on a monthly basis, at a minimum. The KRI's include both internal and external indicators and include loan delinquency levels, classified and watch list loan levels, non-performing loans to loans and to total assets, the loan to deposit ratio, the level of net non-core funding dependence, the level of contingency funding sources, the liquidity coverage ratio, changes in regulatory capital levels, forecasted operating loss and negative media concerning Peoples, irrational competitor pricing that persists and an increase in rates for external funding sources. The LCFP establishes levels that define each of these KRI's under base, mild, moderate and severe scenarios.\nThe LCFP is reviewed and updated at least on an annual basis by the ALCO and the Asset Liability Management and Investment Committee of Peoples Bank's Board of Directors. Additionally, testing of the LCFP is required on an annual basis. Various stress scenarios and the related actions are simulated according to the LCFP. The results are reviewed and discussed, and changes or revisions are made to the LCFP accordingly. Additionally, every two years, the LCFP is subjected to a third-party review for effectiveness and regulatory compliance.\nOverall, management believes the current balance of cash and cash equivalents, and anticipated cash flows from the investment portfolio, along with the availability of other funding sources, will allow Peoples to meet anticipated cash obligations, as well as special needs and off-balance sheet commitments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Activities and Contractual Obligations\nPeoples routinely engages in activities that involve, to varying degrees, elements of risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These activities are part of Peoples' normal course of business and include traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments, interest rate contracts and commitments to make additional capital contributions in low-income housing tax credit investments.\nThe following is a summary of Peoples' significant off-balance sheet activities and contractual obligations. Detailed information regarding these activities and obligations can be found in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as follows:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Activity or Obligation\n</td> <td>Note\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments\n</td> <td>14\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>9\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTraditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments are primarily commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These activities are necessary to meet the financing needs of customers and could require Peoples to make\ncash payments to third parties in the event certain specified future events occur. The contractual amounts represent the extent of Peoples' exposure in these off-balance sheet activities. However, since certain off-balance sheet commitments, particularly standby letters of credit, are expected to expire or only partially be used, the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nPeoples continues to lease certain facilities and equipment under noncancellable operating leases with terms providing for fixed monthly payments over periods generally ranging from two to ten years. Several of Peoples' leased facilities are inside retail shopping centers or office buildings and, as a result, are not available for purchase. Management believes these leased facilities increase Peoples' visibility within its markets and afford sales associates additional access to current and potential clients.\nFor certain acquisitions, often those involving insurance businesses and wealth management books of business, a portion of the consideration is contingent upon revenue metrics being achieved. US GAAP requires that the amounts be recorded upon acquisition based on the best estimate of the future amounts to be paid at the time of acquisition. Any subsequent adjustment to the estimate is recorded in earnings. Based on the acquisitions completed to date, management does not expect contingent consideration to have a material impact on Peoples' future performance.\nThe following table details the aggregate amount of future payments Peoples is required to make under certain contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>482,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>113,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>2,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>272\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent consideration related to acquisitions (2)\n</td> <td>653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension benefits\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>285,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>217,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Amounts reflect solely the minimum required principal payments.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) Amounts assume projected revenue metrics are achieved.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement does not anticipate Peoples' current off-balance sheet activities will have a material impact on its future results of operations and financial condition based on historical experience and recent trends.\nEffects of Inflation on Financial Statements\nSubstantially all of Peoples' assets relate to banking and are monetary in nature. As a result, inflation does not impact Peoples to the same degree as companies in capital-intensive industries in a replacement cost environment. During a period of rising prices, a net monetary asset position results in a loss in purchasing power and conversely a net monetary liability position results in an increase in purchasing power. The opposite would be true during a period of decreasing prices. In the banking industry, monetary assets typically exceed monetary liabilities. The current monetary policy targeting low levels of inflation has resulted in relatively stable price levels. Therefore, inflation has had little impact on Peoples' net assets.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to comprehend the table you have provided since it appears to be incomplete.\n\n- Could you please double-check that all of the necessary cells have values and that they are all contained within the table?

Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to:\n (1) the success, impact, and timing of the implementation of Peoples' business strategies, including the successful integration of recently completed acquisitions and the expansion of consumer lending activity; \n (2) Peoples' ability to integrate the NB&T acquisition and any future acquisitions may be unsuccessful, or may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; \n (3) Peoples may issue equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, which could cause ownership and economic dilution to Peoples' current shareholders; \n (4) local, regional, national and international economic conditions and the impact they may have on Peoples, its customers and its counterparties, and Peoples' assessment of the impact, which may be different than anticipated; \n (5) competitive pressures among financial institutions or from non-financial institutions may increase significantly, including product and pricing pressures, third-party relationships and revenues, and Peoples' ability to attract, develop and retain qualified professionals; \n (6) changes in the interest rate environment due to economic conditions and/or the fiscal policies of the U.S. government and Federal Reserve Board, which may adversely impact interest rates, interest margins and interest rate sensitivity; \n (7) changes in prepayment speeds, loan originations, levels of non-performing assets, delinquent loans and charge-offs, which may be less favorable than expected and adversely impact the amount of interest income generated; \n (8) adverse changes in economic conditions and/or activities, including, but not limited to, continued economic uncertainty in the U.S., the European Union, Asia, and other areas, which could decrease sales volumes and increase loan delinquencies and defaults; \n (9) legislative or regulatory changes or actions, promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder by the State of Ohio, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the OCC, the Federal Reserve Board and the CFPB, which may subject Peoples, its subsidiaries, or one or more acquired companies to a variety of new and more stringent legal and regulatory requirements which adversely affect their respective businesses, including in particular the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act; \n (10) deterioration in the credit quality of Peoples' loan portfolio, which may adversely impact the provision for loan losses; \n (11) changes in accounting standards, policies, estimates or procedures which may adversely affect Peoples' reported financial condition or results of operations; \n (12) Peoples' assumptions and estimates used in applying critical accounting policies, which may prove unreliable, inaccurate or not predictive of actual results; \n (13) adverse changes in the conditions and trends in the financial markets, including political developments, which may adversely affect the fair value of securities within Peoples' investment portfolio, the interest rate sensitivity of Peoples' consolidated balance sheet, and the income generated by Peoples' trust and investment activities; \n (14) Peoples' ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries; \n (15) Peoples' ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate sources of funding and liquidity; \n (16) the impact of new minimum capital thresholds established as a part of the implementation of Basel III; \n (17) the impact of larger or similar sized financial institutions encountering problems, which may adversely affect the banking industry and/or Peoples' business generation and retention, funding and liquidity; \n (18) the costs and effects of regulatory and legal developments, including the outcome of potential regulatory or other governmental inquiries and legal proceedings and results of regulatory examinations; \n (19) Peoples' ability to secure confidential information through the use of computer systems and telecommunications networks, including those of Peoples' third-party vendors and other service providers, may prove inadequate, which could adversely affect customer confidence in Peoples and/or result in Peoples incurring a financial loss; \n (20) the overall adequacy of Peoples' risk management program; \n (21) the impact on Peoples' businesses, as well as on the risks described above, of various domestic or international military or terrorist activities or conflicts; and \n (22) other risk factors relating to the banking industry or Peoples as detailed from time to time in Peoples' reports filed with the SEC, including those risk factors included in the disclosures under the heading \"ITEM 1A.

Copies of documents filed with the SEC are available free of charge at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and/or from Peoples' website - www.peoplesbancorp.com under the \"Investor Relations\" section.\nThe following discussion and analysis of Peoples' Consolidated Financial Statements is presented to provide insight into management's assessment of the financial results and condition for the periods presented. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, as well as the ratios and statistics, contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nSummary of Significant Transactions and Events\nThe following is a summary of transactions or events that have impacted or are expected by management to impact Peoples' results of operations or financial condition:\n \u25e6 On January 6, 2016, Peoples Bank acquired a small financial advisory book of business in Marietta, Ohio for cash consideration of $0.5 million. This acquisition did not materially impact Peoples' financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n \u25e6 During 2015, Peoples recorded aggregate charge-offs of $13.1 million on a single impaired commercial loan relationship consisting of four impaired loans. As of December 31, 2015, Peoples net recorded investment with respect to these loans was zero. \n \u25e6 On December 30, 2015, Peoples announced that Peoples Bank, National Association, the banking subsidiary of Peoples, converted from a national banking association into an Ohio state-chartered bank which is a member of the Federal Reserve System. As a result of the charter conversion, the legal name of Peoples' banking subsidiary was changed to \"Peoples Bank\" and the converted bank will continue to operate under the trade name and federally registered service mark \"Peoples Bank.\" Additionally, Peoples' banking subsidiary will see a reduction in the annual cost associated with regulatory examination fees commencing in 2016. \n \u25e6 On November 3, 2015, Peoples announced that its Board of Directors approved and adopted a share repurchase program authorizing Peoples to purchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $20 million of its outstanding common shares. As of February 24, 2016, Peoples had repurchased an aggregate of 253,870 common shares with a total cost of $4.5 million, although none of these common shares was purchased in 2015. \n \u25e6 On July 24, 2015, Peoples repaid the principal balance of the $12.0 million term loan then outstanding under the Amended Loan Agreement described in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no early termination fees associated with the repayment. The revolving credit loan commitment available under the Amended Loan Agreement remains outstanding. \n \u25e6 On July 21, 2015, Peoples Insurance acquired an insurance agency and related customer accounts in the Lebanon, Ohio area for total cash consideration of $0.9 million, and recorded $0.5 million of customer relationship intangibles and $0.4 million of goodwill. \n \u25e6 At the close of business on March 6, 2015, Peoples completed the acquisition of NB&T Financial Group, Inc. (\"NB&T\"). Under the terms of the merger agreement, Peoples paid $7.75 in cash and 0.9319 in Peoples' common shares for each of the 3,442,329 outstanding NB&T common shares for a total consideration of $102.7 million. NB&T merged into Peoples and NB&T's wholly-owned subsidiary, The National Bank and Trust Company, which operated 22 full-service branches in southwest Ohio, merged into Peoples Bank. The acquisition added $384.6 million of loans and $629.5 million of deposits at the acquisition date, after acquisition accounting adjustments. \n \u25e6 At the close of business on October 24, 2014, Peoples completed the acquisition of North Akron Savings Bank (\"North Akron\") and its 4 full-service offices in Akron, Cuyahoga Falls, Munroe and Norton, Ohio. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Peoples paid $7.655 of consideration per share of North Akron common stock, or $20.1 million, of which 80% was paid in Peoples' common shares and the remaining 20% in cash. The acquisition added $111.5 million of loans and $108.1 million of deposits at the acquisition date, after acquisition accounting adjustments. \n \u25e6 At the close of business on August 22, 2014, Peoples completed the acquisition of Ohio Heritage Bancorp, Inc. (\"Ohio Heritage\") and the 6 full-service offices of its subsidiary, Ohio Heritage Bank, in Coshocton, Newark, Heath, Mount Vernon and New Philadelphia, Ohio. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Peoples paid $110.00 of consideration per share of Ohio Heritage common stock, or $37.7 million, of which 85% was paid in Peoples' common shares and the remaining 15% in cash. The acquisition added $175.8 million of loans and $174.9 million of deposits at the acquisition date, after acquisition accounting adjustments. \n \u25e6 On August 7, 2014, Peoples announced the completion of the sale of 1,847,826 common shares at $23.00 per share to institutional investors through a private placement (the \"Private Equity Issuance\"). Peoples received net proceeds of $40.2 million from the sale, and used the proceeds, in part, to fund the cash consideration for the NB&T acquisition. \n \u25e6 At the close of business on May 30, 2014, Peoples completed the acquisition of Midwest Bancshares, Inc. (\"Midwest\") and the 2 full-service offices of its subsidiary, First National Bank of Wellston, in Wellston and Jackson, Ohio. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Peoples paid $65.50 of consideration per share of Midwest common stock, or $12.6 million, of which 50% was paid in cash and the remaining 50% in Peoples' common shares. The acquisition added $58.7 million of loans and $77.9 million of deposits at the acquisition date, after acquisition accounting adjustments. \n \u25e6 In 2015, Peoples incurred an aggregate of $11.3 million of acquisition-related expenses, compared to $5.1 million in 2014 and $1.5 million in 2013, which were primarily severance costs, fees for legal services and other professional services, deconversion costs and write-offs associated with assets acquired. \n \u25e6 During 2013, Peoples took steps to reduce its investment in bank-owned life insurance (\"BOLI\") contracts and redeploy the funds in order to enhance long-term shareholder return. Peoples received proceeds of $43.1 million during 2013 as a result of the liquidation of BOLI contracts, while the remaining cash surrender value of approximately $6.6 million was recorded as a receivable at December 31, 2013. Peoples received the remaining cash surrender value in the first quarter of 2014, in accordance with the terms of the BOLI contracts (collectively, the \"BOLI Surrender\"). The BOLI Surrender caused Peoples to incur a $2.2 million federal income tax liability in 2013 for the gain associated with the BOLI contracts surrendered. \n \u25e6 Peoples periodically has taken actions to reduce interest rate exposure within the investment portfolio and the entire balance sheet, which have included the sale of low-yielding investment securities and repayment of high-cost borrowings. These actions included the sale of $68.8 million of investment securities, primarily low or volatile yielding residential mortgage-backed securities, during the first quarter of 2013. Some of the proceeds from these investment sales were reinvested in securities during the first quarter with the remaining reinvested early in the second quarter of 2013. \n \u25e6 As described in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Peoples incurred settlement charges of $459,000 during 2015 due to the aggregate amount of lump-sum distributions to participants in Peoples' defined benefit pension plan exceeding the threshold for recognizing such charges during the period. Settlement charges of $1.4 million and $270,000 were recognized during 2014 and 2013, respectively. \n \u25e6 On September 17, 2012, Peoples introduced its new brand as part of a company-wide brand revitalization. The brand is Peoples' promise, which is a guarantee of satisfaction and quality. Peoples incurred costs throughout 2013 associated with the brand revitalization, including marketing due to advertisements, and depreciation expense for new assets related to the $5 million branch renovation project. In 2014, Peoples acquired Midwest, Ohio Heritage and \nNorth Akron and in 2015 acquired NB&T and has continued the consistent company-wide brand revitalization in the newly-acquired facilities.\n \u25e6 Peoples' net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by changes in market interest rates based upon actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board either directly or through its Open Market Committee. These actions include changing the target Federal Funds Rate (the interest rate at which banks lend money to each other), Discount Rate (the interest rate charged to banks for money borrowed from the Federal Reserve Bank) and longer-term market interest rates (primarily U.S. Treasury securities). Longer-term market interest rates also are affected by the demand for U.S. Treasury securities. The resulting changes in the yield curve slope have a direct impact on reinvestment rates for Peoples' earning assets. \n \u25e6 In December 2015, the Federal Reserve Board raised short-term rates, including the Federal Funds Rate and the Discount Rate, 0.25%, to a range of 0.25% to 0.50% for the Federal Funds Rate and 1.00% for the Discount Rate. The Federal Reserve Board had previously maintained its target Federal Funds Rate at a historically low level of 0% to 0.25% since December 2008 and had maintained the Discount Rate at 0.75% since December 2010. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated the possibility that these short-term rates could again be raised in 2016. \n \u25e6 The Federal Reserve ended its program of quantitative easing in the fourth quarter of 2014. Much speculation occurred throughout 2015 as to when the Federal Reserve would begin to raise short-term interest rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note began the year with a significant rally, falling from 2.17% to 1.64% during the month of January. The yield peaked half way through 2015 at 2.49%. It fell below 2% again in October and traded in a range between 2.13% and 2.34% during the last two months of the year. Overall, the Treasury yield curve steepened throughout the year with the 30-year bond yield ending 2015 roughly 25 basis points higher than at the beginning of the year.  The impact of these transactions, where material, is discussed in the applicable sections of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accounting and reporting policies of Peoples conform to US GAAP and to general practices within the financial services industry. A summary of significant accounting policies is contained in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While all of these policies are important to understanding the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment and make estimates or assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the Consolidated Financial Statements could reflect different estimates or assumptions.\nManagement has identified the accounting policies described below as those that, due to the judgments, estimates and assumptions inherent in the policies, are critical to an understanding of Peoples' Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIncome Recognition\nInterest income on loans and investment securities is recognized by methods that result in level rates of return on principal amounts outstanding, including yield adjustments resulting from the amortization of loan costs and premiums on investment securities and accretion of loan fees and discounts on investment securities. Since mortgage-backed securities comprise a sizable portion of Peoples' investment portfolio, a significant increase in principal payments on those securities could impact interest income due to the corresponding acceleration of premium amortization or discount accretion.\nPeoples discontinues the accrual of interest on a loan when conditions cause management to believe collection of all or any portion of the loan's contractual interest is doubtful. Such conditions may include the borrower being 90 days or more past due on any contractual payments or current information regarding the borrower's financial condition and repayment ability. All unpaid accrued interest deemed uncollectable is reversed, which would reduce Peoples' net interest income. Interest received on nonaccrual loans is included in income only if principal recovery is reasonably assured.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nIn general, determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates by management. Peoples maintains an allowance for loan losses based on a quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio and estimation of the losses that are probable of occurrence within the loan portfolio. This formal analysis determines an appropriate level and allocation of the allowance for loan losses among loan types and the resulting recovery of or provision for loan losses by considering factors affecting losses, including specific losses, levels and trends in impaired and nonperforming loans; historical loan loss experience; current national and local economic conditions; volume; growth and composition of the portfolio; regulatory guidance and other relevant factors. Management\ncontinually monitors the loan portfolio through Peoples Bank's Credit Administration Department and Loan Loss Committee to evaluate the appropriateness of the allowance. The recovery or provision could increase or decrease each quarter based upon the results of management's formal analysis.\nThe amount of the allowance for loan losses for the various loan types represents management's estimate of probable losses from existing loans. Management evaluates lending relationships deemed to be impaired on an individual basis and makes specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses for each relationship based on discounted cash flows using the loan's initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans. For all other loans, management evaluates pools of homogeneous loans (such as residential mortgage loans, and direct and indirect consumer loans) and makes general allocations for each loan pool based upon historical loss experience. While allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans, the allowance is available for all loan losses.\nThe evaluation of individual impaired loans requires management to make estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans, which consist primarily of loans placed on nonaccrual status, restructured or internally classified as substandard or doubtful. These reviews are based upon specific quantitative and qualitative criteria, including the size of the loan, the loan cash flow characteristics, loan quality ratings, value of collateral, repayment ability of the borrower, and historical experience factors. Allowances for homogeneous loans are evaluated based upon historical loss experience, adjusted for qualitative risk factors, such as trends in losses and delinquencies, growth of loans in particular markets, and known changes in economic conditions in each lending market. As part of the process of identifying the pools of homogenous loans, management takes into account any concentrations of risk within any portfolio segment, including any significant industrial concentrations. Consistent with the evaluation of allowances for homogenous loans, the allowance relating to the Overdraft Privilege program is based upon management's monthly analysis of accounts in the program. This analysis considers factors that could affect losses on existing accounts, including historical loss experience and length of overdraft.\nThere can be no assurance the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover all losses, but management believes the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015 was adequate to provide for probable losses from existing loans based on information currently available. While management uses available information to estimate losses, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the loan portfolio, and the need for future additions to the allowance, will be based on changes in economic conditions and other relevant factors. As such, adverse changes in economic activity could reduce currently estimated cash flows for both commercial and individual borrowers, which would likely cause Peoples to experience increases in problem assets, delinquencies and losses on loans in the future.\nInvestment Securities\nPeoples' investment portfolio accounted for 26.7% and 27.8% of total assets at December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014 respectively, of which approximately 90% of the securities were classified as available-for-sale. Correspondingly, Peoples carries these securities at fair value on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. As a result, Peoples' Consolidated Balance Sheet may be sensitive to changes in the overall market value of the investment portfolio, due to changes in market interest rates, investor confidence and other factors affecting market values.\nWhile temporary changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities are not recognized in earnings, Peoples is required to evaluate all investment securities with an unrealized loss on a quarterly basis to identify potential other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) losses. This analysis requires management to consider various factors that involve judgment and estimation, including the duration and magnitude of the decline in value, the financial condition of the issuer or pool of issuers, and the structure of the security.\nUnder current US GAAP, an OTTI loss is recognized in earnings only when (1) Peoples intends to sell the debt security; (2) it is more likely than not that Peoples will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) Peoples does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security. In situations where Peoples intends to sell, or when it is more likely than not that Peoples will be required to sell the debt security, the entire OTTI loss must be recognized in earnings. In all other situations, only the portion of the OTTI losses representing the credit loss must be recognized in earnings, with the remaining portion being recognized in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of deferred taxes.\nManagement performed its quarterly analysis of the investment securities with an unrealized loss at December 31, 2015, and concluded no individual securities were other-than-temporarily impaired. Peoples has not recognized an impairment loss in 2015, 2014 or 2013.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nDuring 2015 and in prior years, Peoples recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, Peoples is required to allocate the cost of an acquired company to the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and liabilities assumed\nbased on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess cost over the fair value of net assets acquired and is not amortized but is tested for impairment when indicators of impairment exist, or at least annually. Peoples' other intangible assets consist of customer relationship intangible assets, including core deposit intangibles, representing the present value of future net income to be earned from acquired customer relationships with definite useful lives, which are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nThe value of recorded goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted and Peoples' ability to provide quality, cost-effective services in a competitive market place. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods. Potential goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of the reporting unit (as defined by US GAAP) is less than its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized in earnings only when the carrying amount of goodwill is less than its implied fair value.\nThe process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves highly subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of Peoples' reporting unit and, in some cases, goodwill itself. As a result, changes to these judgments, estimates and assumptions in future periods could result in materially different results.\nPeoples currently possesses a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. While quoted market prices exist for Peoples' common shares since they are publicly traded, these market prices do not necessarily reflect the value associated with gaining control of an entity. Thus, management takes into account all appropriate fair value measurements in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.\nThe measurement of any actual impairment loss requires management to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and separately identifiable intangible net assets (including unrecognized intangible assets) from the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of net tangible assets is calculated using the methodologies described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPeoples performs its required annual impairment test as of June 30 each year. The goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process that includes (1) determining if potential goodwill impairment exists and (2) measuring the impairment loss, if any. At June 30, 2015, management's analysis concluded that the estimated fair value of Peoples' single reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. The analysis also included an assessment of events and circumstances considering several key factors such as economic and local market conditions, overall financial performance, changes in management or key personnel, and share price.\nPeoples is required to perform interim tests for goodwill impairment in subsequent quarters if events occur or circumstances change that indicate potential goodwill impairment exists, such as adverse changes to Peoples' business or a significant decline in Peoples' market capitalization. At December 31, 2015, Peoples completed the interim test for goodwill, and due to potential indicators continued the analysis related to the first step of the goodwill impairment test. Peoples utilized the income approach and market approach analysis in determining that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount and that the goodwill of the reporting unit was not considered impaired. Therefore, Peoples did not complete the second step of the goodwill impairment test. For further information regarding goodwill, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPeoples records servicing rights ( SRs\u201d) in connection with its mortgage banking and small business lending activities, which are intangible assets representing the right to service loans sold to third-party investors. These intangible assets are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently amortized over the estimated life of the loans sold. SRs are stratified based on their predominant risk characteristics and assessed for impairment at the strata level at each reporting date based on their fair value. At December 31, 2015, management concluded no portion of the recorded SRs was impaired since the fair value equaled or exceeded the carrying value. However, future events, such as a significant increase in prepayment speeds, could result in a fair value that is less than the carrying amount, which would require the recognition of an impairment loss in earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded based on the liability method of accounting, which includes the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. In general, Peoples records deferred tax assets when the event giving rise to the tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nA valuation allowance is recognized to reduce any deferred tax asset that, based upon available information, it is more-likely-than-not all, or any portion, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Assessing the need for, and amount of, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires significant judgment and analysis of evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets. In most cases, the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon Peoples generating a sufficient level of taxable income in future periods, which can be difficult to predict. Peoples' largest\ndeferred tax assets involve differences related to Peoples' allowance for loan losses and accrued employee benefits. At December 31, 2015, management determined a valuation allowance would be recorded against the deferred tax assets associated with its investment in a partnership investment. No other valuation allowances were needed at either December 31, 2015 or 2014.\nThe calculation of tax liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment since it involves the application of complex tax laws that are subject to different interpretations by Peoples and the various tax authorities. Peoples' interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management's ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law.\nFrom time-to-time and in the ordinary course of business, Peoples is involved in inquiries and reviews by tax authorities that normally require management to provide supplemental information to support certain tax positions taken by Peoples in its tax returns. Uncertain tax positions are initially recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits was immaterial at both December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nManagement believes it has taken appropriate positions on its tax returns, although the ultimate outcome of any tax review cannot be predicted with certainty. Consequently, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the current and historical financial statements.\nFair Value Measurements\nAs a financial services company, the carrying value of certain financial assets and liabilities is impacted by the application of fair value measurements, either directly or indirectly. In certain cases, an asset or liability is measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis, such as available-for-sale investment securities. In other cases, management must rely on estimates or judgments to determine if an asset or liability not measured at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or whether a valuation reserve should be established. Given the inherent volatility, the use of fair value measurements may have a significant impact on the carrying value of assets or liabilities, or result in material changes to the consolidated financial statements, from period to period.\nDetailed information regarding fair value measurements can be found in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is a summary of those assets and liabilities that may be affected by fair value measurements, as well as a brief description of the current accounting practices and valuation methodologies employed by Peoples:\nAvailable-for-Sale Investment Securities\nInvestment securities classified as available-for-sale are measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis. For most securities, the fair value is based upon quoted market prices (Level 1) or determined by pricing models that consider observable market data (Level 2). For structured investment securities, the fair value often must be based upon unobservable market data, such as non-binding broker quotes and discounted cash flow analysis or similar models, due to the absence of an active market for these securities (Level 3). As a result, management's determination of fair value for these securities is highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions, which could change materially between periods. Management occasionally uses information from independent third-party consultants in its determination of the fair value of more complex structured investment securities. At December 31, 2015, all of Peoples' available-for-sale investment securities were measured using observable market data.\nAt December 31, 2015, the majority of the investment securities with Level 2 fair values were determined using information provided by third-party pricing services. Management reviews the valuation methodology and quality controls utilized by the pricing services in management's overall assessment of the reasonableness of the fair values provided. To the extent available, management utilizes an independent third-party pricing source to assist in its assessment of the values provided by its primary pricing services. Management reviews the fair values provided by these third parties on a quarterly basis and challenges prices when it believes a discrepancy in pricing exists. Based on Peoples' past experience, no discrepancies have been noted related to current pricing and values.\nImpaired loans\nFor loans considered impaired, the amount of impairment loss recognized is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is expected solely from the sale of the collateral. Management typically relies on the fair value of the underlying collateral due to the significant uncertainty surrounding the borrower's ability to make future payments. The vast majority of the collateral securing impaired loans is real estate, although the collateral may also include accounts receivable and equipment, inventory or similar personal property. The fair value of the collateral used by management represents the estimated proceeds to be received from the sale of the\ncollateral, less costs incurred during the sale, based upon observable market data or market value data provided by independent, licensed or certified appraisers.\nServicing Rights\nSRs are carried at the lower of amortized cost or market value, and, therefore, can be subject to fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis. SRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. Thus, management determines fair value based upon a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income provided by an independent third-party consultant. This valuation model is affected by various input factors, such as servicing costs, expected prepayment speeds and discount rates, which are subject to change between reporting periods. As a result, significant changes to these factors could result in a material change to the calculated fair value of SRs.\nTo determine the fair value of its servicing rights ( SRs\u201d) each reporting quarter, Peoples provides information representing loan information accompanied by escrow amounts to a third-party valuation firm. The third-party then evaluates the possible impairment of SRs as described below. Loans are evaluated on a discounted earnings basis to determine the present value of future earnings that Peoples expects to realize from the portfolio. Earnings are projected from a variety of sources including loan service fees, net interest earned on escrow balances, miscellaneous income and costs to service the loans. The present value of future earnings is the estimated fair value, calculated using consensus assumptions that a third-party purchaser would utilize in evaluating a potential acquisition of the SRs.\nEvents that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates and the related impact on mortgage loan prepayment speeds, and the payment performance of the underlying loans. Peoples believes this methodology provides a reasonable estimate. Mortgage loan prepayment estimates were determined through the application of the current dealer projected prepayment rates by product type and interest rate as published by Bloomberg, L.P. as of January 4, 2016, and adjusted for historical prepayment factors based on state, type of servicing, year of origination, and pass through coupon. The adjustable rate mortgage loan prepayment estimates were determined through the application of market trading assumptions as of January 4, 2016, and adjusted for historical prepayment factors based on state, type of servicing, year of origination, and pass through coupon.\nThese earnings are used to calculate the approximate cash flow that could be received from the servicing portfolio. Valuation results are provided quarterly to Peoples. At that time, Peoples reviews the information and SRs are marked to the lower of amortized cost or fair value for the current quarter.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $10.9 million, compared to $16.7 million in 2014 and $17.6 million in 2013, representing earnings per diluted common share of $0.61, $1.35 and $1.63, respectively. The decrease in earnings during 2015 was primarily driven by provision for loan losses of $14.1 million coupled with $11.3 million of acquisition-related costs. The decrease in 2014 from 2013 was primarily driven by acquisition-related costs of $5.1 million and pension settlement charges of $1.4 million. Earnings in 2013 were impacted by additional operating costs associated with various strategic investments to grow revenue and a lower recovery of loan losses.\nIn 2015, Peoples had a provision for loan losses of $14.1 million related primarily to the charge-off of one large commercial loan relationship coupled with loan growth and downward trends in criticized loans. Peoples recorded net charge-offs of $15.2 million for 2015, compared to net recoveries of $0.5 million and $3.7 million, respectively, for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The provision for or recovery of loan losses represented amounts needed, in management's opinion, to maintain the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.\nYear-over-year income and expense was largely effected by the acquisitions completed in 2014 and 2015. In 2014, Peoples acquired Midwest on May 30, Ohio Heritage on August 22, and North Akron on October 24, and in 2015, Peoples acquired NB&T on March 6. Due to the timing of the acquisitions, 2015 included a full year impact of the 2014 acquisitions compared to only a partial impact in 2014. In 2015, NB&T income and expenses were included beginning on March 6, 2015.\nNet interest income grew 40% to $97.6 million in 2015 compared to $69.5 million in 2014 and $55.4 million in 2013, mostly due to higher loan balances in connection with the recent acquisitions, coupled with organic loan growth. Net interest margin was 3.53% in 2015, higher than the 3.45% in 2014 and 3.23% in 2013. The increase in 2015 was due to accretion income from the completed acquisitions, organic loan growth, change in asset mix and a reduction in funding costs. Accretion income from acquisitions added approximately 17 basis points to net interest margin in 2015 compared to 13 basis points in 2014 and 4 basis points in 2013. The increase in net interest margin in 2014 was mostly due to higher loan balances in connection with acquisitions and organic loan growth. The decrease in net interest margin during 2013 was largely a result of the low interest rate environment, which put downward pressure on asset yields.\nTotal non-interest income, which excludes gains and losses on investment securities, asset disposals and other transactions, increased 18% in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased 8% comparing 2014 to 2013. During 2015, electronic banking income grew 35%, or $2.3 million, trust and investment income increased 25%, or $1.9 million, service charges on\ndeposit accounts grew 18%, or $1.7 million and bank owned life insurance income increased $0.5 million. The noted increases reflected a full year of income from the 2014 acquisitions and approximately nine months of income related to the NB&T acquisition.\nTotal other expense increased 35%, or $30.1 million, for the year ended December 31, 2015, due largely to a full year of expenses related to the 2014 acquisitions and approximately nine months of expenses related to the NB&T acquisition. The NB&T acquisition added 22 additional branches which increased net occupancy and equipment, higher salaries and employee benefits, due to additional employees, increased intangible asset amortization and increased electronic banking expense. Acquisition-related expenses included in other expenses during 2015 were $10.7 million, compared to $4.8 million in 2014 and $1.4 million in 2013.\nAt December 31, 2015, total assets were up 27%, or $691.2 million to $3.26 billion versus $2.57 billion at year-end 2014. The increase was primarily related to the acquisition of $710.5 million in assets during 2015. Excluding the impact of the loans acquired in the NB&T acquisition, loan balances grew 7% or $451.6 million for the year. The allowance for loan losses decreased $1.1 million to $16.8 million, or 1.19% of originated loans, net of deferred fees and costs, compared to $17.9 million and 1.48% at December 31, 2014. Total investment securities grew to $868.8 million, or 26.7% of total assets at December 31, 2015, compared to $713.7 million, or 27.8% of total assets at the prior year-end.\nTotal liabilities were $2.84 billion at December 31, 2015, up $611.5 million since December 31, 2014. Contributing to this increase were acquired deposits of approximately $629.5 million. Non-interest-bearing deposits comprised 28.7% of total retail deposits at December 31, 2015, versus 26.0% at year-end 2014. At December 31, 2015, total borrowed funds were $274.1 million, up $6.7 million compared to the prior year-end, as Peoples assumed $6.6 million from the NB&T acquisition.\nAt December 31, 2015, total stockholders' equity was $419.8 million, up $79.7 million from December 31, 2014. The increase in common stock within total stockholders' equity was primarily due to the common shares issued in connection with 2015 acquisition of NB&T which had a value of $76.0 million. Peoples' regulatory capital ratios remained significantly higher than \"well capitalized\" minimums. Peoples' Tier 1 Capital ratio decreased to 13.68% at December 31, 2015, versus 14.32% at December 31, 2014, while the Total Capital ratio was 14.55% versus 15.48% at December 31, 2014. In addition, Peoples' tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.69% and tangible book value per share was $14.68 at December 31, 2015, versus 9.39% and $15.57 at December 31, 2014, respectively. Additional information regarding capital requirements can be found in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInterest Income and Expense\nPeoples earns interest income on loans and investments and incurs interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income, the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense, remains Peoples' largest source of revenue. The amount of net interest income earned by Peoples is affected by various factors, including changes in market interest rates due to the Federal Reserve Board's monetary policy, the level and degree of pricing competition for both loans and deposits in Peoples' markets, and the amount and composition of Peoples' earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nPeoples monitors net interest income performance and manages its balance sheet composition through regular ALCO meetings. The asset-liability management process employed by the ALCO is intended to mitigate the impact of future interest rate changes on Peoples' net interest income and earnings. However, the frequency and/or magnitude of changes in market interest rates are difficult to predict, and may have a greater impact on net interest income than adjustments management is able to make.\nThe following table details Peoples' average balance sheets for the years ended December 31:\n\n (1) Average balances are based on carrying value. \n (2) Interest income and yields are presented on a fully tax-equivalent basis using a 35% federal statutory tax rate. \n (3) Average balances include nonaccrual and impaired loans. Interest income includes interest earned on nonaccrual loans prior to the loans being placed on nonaccrual status. Loan fees included in interest income were immaterial for all periods presented. \n (4) Loans held for sale are included in the average loan balance listed. Related interest income on loans originated for sale prior to the loan being sold is included in loan interest income.  The following table provides an analysis of the changes in fully tax-equivalent ( FTE\u201d) net interest income:\n\n (1) The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to rate and volume changes in proportion to the  relationship of the dollar amounts of the changes in each.\n (2) Interest income and yields are presented on a fully tax-equivalent basis using a 35% federal statutory tax rate.  As part of the analysis of net interest income, management converts tax-exempt income earned on obligations of states and political subdivisions to the pre-tax equivalent of taxable income using an effective tax rate of 35%. Management believes the resulting FTE net interest income allows for a more meaningful comparison of tax-exempt income and yields to their taxable equivalents. Net interest margin, which is calculated by dividing FTE net interest income by average interest-\nearning assets, serves as an important measurement of the net revenue stream generated by the volume, mix and pricing of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nThe following table details the calculation of FTE net interest income for the years ended December 31:\n\nDuring 2015, Peoples recognized accretion income, net of amortization expense, from acquisitions of $4.8 million, which added approximately 17 basis points to net interest margin, compared to $2.6 million and 13 basis points, and $0.7 million and 4 basis points in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Also during 2015, additional interest income from prepayment fees and interest recovered on nonaccrual loans was $591,000 compared to $240,000 in 2014 and $976,000 in 2013. The primary driver of the increase in net interest income during 2015 was the higher loan balances resulting from organic growth and acquired loans.\nThe yield on investment securities decreased in 2015 as interest rates fell and prepayment speeds on mortgage-backed securities increased. The increase in prepayment speeds was due primarily to greater mortgage refinancing activity driven by lower interest rates. This resulted in higher monthly principal cashflows in the investment portfolio. In 2015, the average monthly principal cashflow was approximately $10.1 million compared to $6.0 million in 2014 and $8.0 million in 2013.\nFunding costs have declined since 2013 as Peoples executed a strategy of replacing higher-cost funding with low-cost deposits. In 2015, funding costs decreased 18 basis points, compared to15 basis points in 2014 and 27 basis points in 2013. Additional improvement was due to deploying excess cash on the balance sheet by buying securities in the investment portfolio and paying off a $12.0 million term loan. The continued increase in the balance of low-cost deposits has provided funding for loan growth during these periods.\nDetailed information regarding changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets can be found under appropriate captions of the FINANCIAL CONDITION\u201d section of this discussion. Additional information regarding Peoples' interest rate risk and the potential impact of interest rate changes on Peoples' results of operations and financial condition can be found later in this discussion under the caption Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity\u201d.\nProvision for (Recovery of) Loan Losses\nThe following table details Peoples' provision for (or recovery of) loan losses recognized for the years ended December 31:\n\nThe provision for (or recovery of) loan losses represents the amount needed to maintain the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses based on management's formal quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio and procedural methodology that estimates the amount of probable credit losses. This process considers various factors that affect losses, such as changes in Peoples' loan quality, historical loss experience and current economic conditions. The provision for loan losses recorded in 2015 was primarily due to the charge-off of one large commercial loan relationship coupled with organic loan growth and downward trends in criticized loans. The provision for loan losses recorded in 2014 was driven by checking account overdrafts, while the impact of increases in criticized loans was mitigated by $1.8 million of recoveries on three loans that were previously charged off. The recovery of loan losses recorded during 2013 was driven mostly by recoveries on commercial real estate loans that had previously incurred charge-offs.\nAdditional information regarding changes in the allowance for loan losses and loan credit quality can be found later in this discussion under the caption Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d.\nNet Loss on Asset Disposals and Other Transactions\nThe following table details the other (losses) gains for the years ended December 31 recognized by Peoples:\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, as well as the ratios and statistics, contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nSummary of Significant Transactions and Events\nThe following is a summary of transactions or events that have impacted or are expected by management to impact Peoples' results of operations or financial condition:\n \u25e6 On January 6, 2016, Peoples Bank acquired a small financial advisory book of business in Marietta, Ohio for cash consideration of $0.5 million. This acquisition did not materially impact Peoples' financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n \u25e6 During 2015, Peoples recorded aggregate charge-offs of $13.1 million on a single impaired commercial loan relationship consisting of four impaired loans. As of December 31, 2015, Peoples net recorded investment with respect to these loans was zero. \n \u25e6 On December 30, 2015, Peoples announced that Peoples Bank, National Association, the banking subsidiary of Peoples, converted from a national banking association into an Ohio state-chartered bank which is a member of the Federal Reserve System. As a result of the charter conversion, the legal name of Peoples' banking subsidiary was changed to \"Peoples Bank\" and the converted bank will continue to operate under the trade name and federally registered service mark \"Peoples Bank.\" Additionally, Peoples' banking subsidiary will see a reduction in the annual cost associated with regulatory examination fees commencing in 2016. \n \u25e6 On November 3, 2015, Peoples announced that its Board of Directors approved and adopted a share repurchase program authorizing Peoples to purchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $20 million of its outstanding common shares. As of February 24, 2016, Peoples had repurchased an aggregate of 253,870 common shares with a total cost of $4.5 million, although none of these common shares was purchased in 2015. \n \u25e6 On July 24, 2015, Peoples repaid the principal balance of the $12.0 million term loan then outstanding under the Amended Loan Agreement described in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no early termination fees associated with the repayment. The revolving credit loan commitment available under the Amended Loan Agreement remains outstanding. \n \u25e6 On July 21, 2015, Peoples Insurance acquired an insurance agency and related customer accounts in the Lebanon, Ohio area for total cash consideration of $0.9 million, and recorded $0.5 million of customer relationship intangibles and $0.4 million of goodwill. \n \u25e6 At the close of business on March 6, 2015, Peoples completed the acquisition of NB&T Financial Group, Inc. (\"NB&T\"). Under the terms of the merger agreement, Peoples paid $7.75 in cash and 0.9319 in Peoples' common shares for each of the 3,442,329 outstanding NB&T common shares for a total consideration of $102.7 million. NB&T merged into Peoples and NB&T's wholly-owned subsidiary, The National Bank and Trust Company, which operated 22 full-service branches in southwest Ohio, merged into Peoples Bank. The acquisition added $384.6 million of loans and $629.5 million of deposits at the acquisition date, after acquisition accounting adjustments. \n \u25e6 At the close of business on October 24, 2014, Peoples completed the acquisition of North Akron Savings Bank (\"North Akron\") and its 4 full-service offices in Akron, Cuyahoga Falls, Munroe and Norton, Ohio. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Peoples paid $7.655 of consideration per share of North Akron common stock, or $20.1 million, of which 80% was paid in Peoples' common shares and the remaining 20% in cash. The acquisition added $111.5 million of loans and $108.1 million of deposits at the acquisition date, after acquisition accounting adjustments. \n \u25e6 At the close of business on August 22, 2014, Peoples completed the acquisition of Ohio Heritage Bancorp, Inc. (\"Ohio Heritage\") and the 6 full-service offices of its subsidiary, Ohio Heritage Bank, in Coshocton, Newark, Heath, Mount Vernon and New Philadelphia, Ohio. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Peoples paid $110.00 of consideration per share of Ohio Heritage common stock, or $37.7 million, of which 85% was paid in Peoples' common shares and the remaining 15% in cash. The acquisition added $175.8 million of loans and $174.9 million of deposits at the acquisition date, after acquisition accounting adjustments. \n \u25e6 On August 7, 2014, Peoples announced the completion of the sale of 1,847,826 common shares at $23.00 per share to institutional investors through a private placement (the \"Private Equity Issuance\"). Peoples received net proceeds of $40.2 million from the sale, and used the proceeds, in part, to fund the cash consideration for the NB&T acquisition. \n \u25e6 At the close of business on May 30, 2014, Peoples completed the acquisition of Midwest Bancshares, Inc. (\"Midwest\") and the 2 full-service offices of its subsidiary, First National Bank of Wellston, in Wellston and Jackson, Ohio. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Peoples paid $65.50 of consideration per share of Midwest common stock, or $12.6 million, of which 50% was paid in cash and the remaining 50% in Peoples' common shares. The acquisition added $58.7 million of loans and $77.9 million of deposits at the acquisition date, after acquisition accounting adjustments. \n \u25e6 In 2015, Peoples incurred an aggregate of $11.3 million of acquisition-related expenses, compared to $5.1 million in 2014 and $1.5 million in 2013, which were primarily severance costs, fees for legal services and other professional services, deconversion costs and write-offs associated with assets acquired. \n \u25e6 During 2013, Peoples took steps to reduce its investment in bank-owned life insurance (\"BOLI\") contracts and redeploy the funds in order to enhance long-term shareholder return. Peoples received proceeds of $43.1 million during 2013 as a result of the liquidation of BOLI contracts, while the remaining cash surrender value of approximately $6.6 million was recorded as a receivable at December 31, 2013. Peoples received the remaining cash surrender value in the first quarter of 2014, in accordance with the terms of the BOLI contracts (collectively, the \"BOLI Surrender\"). The BOLI Surrender caused Peoples to incur a $2.2 million federal income tax liability in 2013 for the gain associated with the BOLI contracts surrendered. \n \u25e6 Peoples periodically has taken actions to reduce interest rate exposure within the investment portfolio and the entire balance sheet, which have included the sale of low-yielding investment securities and repayment of high-cost borrowings. These actions included the sale of $68.8 million of investment securities, primarily low or volatile yielding residential mortgage-backed securities, during the first quarter of 2013. Some of the proceeds from these investment sales were reinvested in securities during the first quarter with the remaining reinvested early in the second quarter of 2013. \n \u25e6 As described in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Peoples incurred settlement charges of $459,000 during 2015 due to the aggregate amount of lump-sum distributions to participants in Peoples' defined benefit pension plan exceeding the threshold for recognizing such charges during the period. Settlement charges of $1.4 million and $270,000 were recognized during 2014 and 2013, respectively. \n \u25e6 On September 17, 2012, Peoples introduced its new brand as part of a company-wide brand revitalization. The brand is Peoples' promise, which is a guarantee of satisfaction and quality. Peoples incurred costs throughout 2013 associated with the brand revitalization, including marketing due to advertisements, and depreciation expense for new assets related to the $5 million branch renovation project. In 2014, Peoples acquired Midwest, Ohio Heritage and \nNorth Akron and in 2015 acquired NB&T and has continued the consistent company-wide brand revitalization in the newly-acquired facilities.\n \u25e6 Peoples' net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by changes in market interest rates based upon actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board either directly or through its Open Market Committee. These actions include changing the target Federal Funds Rate (the interest rate at which banks lend money to each other), Discount Rate (the interest rate charged to banks for money borrowed from the Federal Reserve Bank) and longer-term market interest rates (primarily U.S. Treasury securities). Longer-term market interest rates also are affected by the demand for U.S. Treasury securities. The resulting changes in the yield curve slope have a direct impact on reinvestment rates for Peoples' earning assets. \n \u25e6 In December 2015, the Federal Reserve Board raised short-term rates, including the Federal Funds Rate and the Discount Rate, 0.25%, to a range of 0.25% to 0.50% for the Federal Funds Rate and 1.00% for the Discount Rate. The Federal Reserve Board had previously maintained its target Federal Funds Rate at a historically low level of 0% to 0.25% since December 2008 and had maintained the Discount Rate at 0.75% since December 2010. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated the possibility that these short-term rates could again be raised in 2016. \n \u25e6 The Federal Reserve ended its program of quantitative easing in the fourth quarter of 2014. Much speculation occurred throughout 2015 as to when the Federal Reserve would begin to raise short-term interest rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note began the year with a significant rally, falling from 2.17% to 1.64% during the month of January. The yield peaked half way through 2015 at 2.49%. It fell below 2% again in October and traded in a range between 2.13% and 2.34% during the last two months of the year. Overall, the Treasury yield curve steepened throughout the year with the 30-year bond yield ending 2015 roughly 25 basis points higher than at the beginning of the year.  The impact of these transactions, where material, is discussed in the applicable sections of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accounting and reporting policies of Peoples conform to US GAAP and to general practices within the financial services industry. A summary of significant accounting policies is contained in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While all of these policies are important to understanding the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment and make estimates or assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the Consolidated Financial Statements could reflect different estimates or assumptions.\nManagement has identified the accounting policies described below as those that, due to the judgments, estimates and assumptions inherent in the policies, are critical to an understanding of Peoples' Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIncome Recognition\nInterest income on loans and investment securities is recognized by methods that result in level rates of return on principal amounts outstanding, including yield adjustments resulting from the amortization of loan costs and premiums on investment securities and accretion of loan fees and discounts on investment securities. Since mortgage-backed securities comprise a sizable portion of Peoples' investment portfolio, a significant increase in principal payments on those securities could impact interest income due to the corresponding acceleration of premium amortization or discount accretion.\nPeoples discontinues the accrual of interest on a loan when conditions cause management to believe collection of all or any portion of the loan's contractual interest is doubtful. Such conditions may include the borrower being 90 days or more past due on any contractual payments or current information regarding the borrower's financial condition and repayment ability. All unpaid accrued interest deemed uncollectable is reversed, which would reduce Peoples' net interest income. Interest received on nonaccrual loans is included in income only if principal recovery is reasonably assured.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nIn general, determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates by management. Peoples maintains an allowance for loan losses based on a quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio and estimation of the losses that are probable of occurrence within the loan portfolio. This formal analysis determines an appropriate level and allocation of the allowance for loan losses among loan types and the resulting recovery of or provision for loan losses by considering factors affecting losses, including specific losses, levels and trends in impaired and nonperforming loans; historical loan loss experience; current national and local economic conditions; volume; growth and composition of the portfolio; regulatory guidance and other relevant factors. Management\ncontinually monitors the loan portfolio through Peoples Bank's Credit Administration Department and Loan Loss Committee to evaluate the appropriateness of the allowance. The recovery or provision could increase or decrease each quarter based upon the results of management's formal analysis.\nThe amount of the allowance for loan losses for the various loan types represents management's estimate of probable losses from existing loans. Management evaluates lending relationships deemed to be impaired on an individual basis and makes specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses for each relationship based on discounted cash flows using the loan's initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans. For all other loans, management evaluates pools of homogeneous loans (such as residential mortgage loans, and direct and indirect consumer loans) and makes general allocations for each loan pool based upon historical loss experience. While allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans, the allowance is available for all loan losses.\nThe evaluation of individual impaired loans requires management to make estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans, which consist primarily of loans placed on nonaccrual status, restructured or internally classified as substandard or doubtful. These reviews are based upon specific quantitative and qualitative criteria, including the size of the loan, the loan cash flow characteristics, loan quality ratings, value of collateral, repayment ability of the borrower, and historical experience factors. Allowances for homogeneous loans are evaluated based upon historical loss experience, adjusted for qualitative risk factors, such as trends in losses and delinquencies, growth of loans in particular markets, and known changes in economic conditions in each lending market. As part of the process of identifying the pools of homogenous loans, management takes into account any concentrations of risk within any portfolio segment, including any significant industrial concentrations. Consistent with the evaluation of allowances for homogenous loans, the allowance relating to the Overdraft Privilege program is based upon management's monthly analysis of accounts in the program. This analysis considers factors that could affect losses on existing accounts, including historical loss experience and length of overdraft.\nThere can be no assurance the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover all losses, but management believes the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015 was adequate to provide for probable losses from existing loans based on information currently available. While management uses available information to estimate losses, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the loan portfolio, and the need for future additions to the allowance, will be based on changes in economic conditions and other relevant factors. As such, adverse changes in economic activity could reduce currently estimated cash flows for both commercial and individual borrowers, which would likely cause Peoples to experience increases in problem assets, delinquencies and losses on loans in the future.\nInvestment Securities\nPeoples' investment portfolio accounted for 26.7% and 27.8% of total assets at December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014 respectively, of which approximately 90% of the securities were classified as available-for-sale. Correspondingly, Peoples carries these securities at fair value on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. As a result, Peoples' Consolidated Balance Sheet may be sensitive to changes in the overall market value of the investment portfolio, due to changes in market interest rates, investor confidence and other factors affecting market values.\nWhile temporary changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities are not recognized in earnings, Peoples is required to evaluate all investment securities with an unrealized loss on a quarterly basis to identify potential other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) losses. This analysis requires management to consider various factors that involve judgment and estimation, including the duration and magnitude of the decline in value, the financial condition of the issuer or pool of issuers, and the structure of the security.\nUnder current US GAAP, an OTTI loss is recognized in earnings only when (1) Peoples intends to sell the debt security; (2) it is more likely than not that Peoples will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) Peoples does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security. In situations where Peoples intends to sell, or when it is more likely than not that Peoples will be required to sell the debt security, the entire OTTI loss must be recognized in earnings. In all other situations, only the portion of the OTTI losses representing the credit loss must be recognized in earnings, with the remaining portion being recognized in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of deferred taxes.\nManagement performed its quarterly analysis of the investment securities with an unrealized loss at December 31, 2015, and concluded no individual securities were other-than-temporarily impaired. Peoples has not recognized an impairment loss in 2015, 2014 or 2013.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nDuring 2015 and in prior years, Peoples recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, Peoples is required to allocate the cost of an acquired company to the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and liabilities assumed\nbased on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess cost over the fair value of net assets acquired and is not amortized but is tested for impairment when indicators of impairment exist, or at least annually. Peoples' other intangible assets consist of customer relationship intangible assets, including core deposit intangibles, representing the present value of future net income to be earned from acquired customer relationships with definite useful lives, which are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nThe value of recorded goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted and Peoples' ability to provide quality, cost-effective services in a competitive market place. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods. Potential goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of the reporting unit (as defined by US GAAP) is less than its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized in earnings only when the carrying amount of goodwill is less than its implied fair value.\nThe process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves highly subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of Peoples' reporting unit and, in some cases, goodwill itself. As a result, changes to these judgments, estimates and assumptions in future periods could result in materially different results.\nPeoples currently possesses a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. While quoted market prices exist for Peoples' common shares since they are publicly traded, these market prices do not necessarily reflect the value associated with gaining control of an entity. Thus, management takes into account all appropriate fair value measurements in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.\nThe measurement of any actual impairment loss requires management to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and separately identifiable intangible net assets (including unrecognized intangible assets) from the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of net tangible assets is calculated using the methodologies described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPeoples performs its required annual impairment test as of June 30 each year. The goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process that includes (1) determining if potential goodwill impairment exists and (2) measuring the impairment loss, if any. At June 30, 2015, management's analysis concluded that the estimated fair value of Peoples' single reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. The analysis also included an assessment of events and circumstances considering several key factors such as economic and local market conditions, overall financial performance, changes in management or key personnel, and share price.\nPeoples is required to perform interim tests for goodwill impairment in subsequent quarters if events occur or circumstances change that indicate potential goodwill impairment exists, such as adverse changes to Peoples' business or a significant decline in Peoples' market capitalization. At December 31, 2015, Peoples completed the interim test for goodwill, and due to potential indicators continued the analysis related to the first step of the goodwill impairment test. Peoples utilized the income approach and market approach analysis in determining that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount and that the goodwill of the reporting unit was not considered impaired. Therefore, Peoples did not complete the second step of the goodwill impairment test. For further information regarding goodwill, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPeoples records servicing rights ( SRs\u201d) in connection with its mortgage banking and small business lending activities, which are intangible assets representing the right to service loans sold to third-party investors. These intangible assets are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently amortized over the estimated life of the loans sold. SRs are stratified based on their predominant risk characteristics and assessed for impairment at the strata level at each reporting date based on their fair value. At December 31, 2015, management concluded no portion of the recorded SRs was impaired since the fair value equaled or exceeded the carrying value. However, future events, such as a significant increase in prepayment speeds, could result in a fair value that is less than the carrying amount, which would require the recognition of an impairment loss in earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded based on the liability method of accounting, which includes the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. In general, Peoples records deferred tax assets when the event giving rise to the tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nA valuation allowance is recognized to reduce any deferred tax asset that, based upon available information, it is more-likely-than-not all, or any portion, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Assessing the need for, and amount of, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires significant judgment and analysis of evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets. In most cases, the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon Peoples generating a sufficient level of taxable income in future periods, which can be difficult to predict. Peoples' largest\ndeferred tax assets involve differences related to Peoples' allowance for loan losses and accrued employee benefits. At December 31, 2015, management determined a valuation allowance would be recorded against the deferred tax assets associated with its investment in a partnership investment. No other valuation allowances were needed at either December 31, 2015 or 2014.\nThe calculation of tax liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment since it involves the application of complex tax laws that are subject to different interpretations by Peoples and the various tax authorities. Peoples' interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management's ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law.\nFrom time-to-time and in the ordinary course of business, Peoples is involved in inquiries and reviews by tax authorities that normally require management to provide supplemental information to support certain tax positions taken by Peoples in its tax returns. Uncertain tax positions are initially recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits was immaterial at both December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nManagement believes it has taken appropriate positions on its tax returns, although the ultimate outcome of any tax review cannot be predicted with certainty. Consequently, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the current and historical financial statements.\nFair Value Measurements\nAs a financial services company, the carrying value of certain financial assets and liabilities is impacted by the application of fair value measurements, either directly or indirectly. In certain cases, an asset or liability is measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis, such as available-for-sale investment securities. In other cases, management must rely on estimates or judgments to determine if an asset or liability not measured at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or whether a valuation reserve should be established. Given the inherent volatility, the use of fair value measurements may have a significant impact on the carrying value of assets or liabilities, or result in material changes to the consolidated financial statements, from period to period.\nDetailed information regarding fair value measurements can be found in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is a summary of those assets and liabilities that may be affected by fair value measurements, as well as a brief description of the current accounting practices and valuation methodologies employed by Peoples:\nAvailable-for-Sale Investment Securities\nInvestment securities classified as available-for-sale are measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis. For most securities, the fair value is based upon quoted market prices (Level 1) or determined by pricing models that consider observable market data (Level 2). For structured investment securities, the fair value often must be based upon unobservable market data, such as non-binding broker quotes and discounted cash flow analysis or similar models, due to the absence of an active market for these securities (Level 3). As a result, management's determination of fair value for these securities is highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions, which could change materially between periods. Management occasionally uses information from independent third-party consultants in its determination of the fair value of more complex structured investment securities. At December 31, 2015, all of Peoples' available-for-sale investment securities were measured using observable market data.\nAt December 31, 2015, the majority of the investment securities with Level 2 fair values were determined using information provided by third-party pricing services. Management reviews the valuation methodology and quality controls utilized by the pricing services in management's overall assessment of the reasonableness of the fair values provided. To the extent available, management utilizes an independent third-party pricing source to assist in its assessment of the values provided by its primary pricing services. Management reviews the fair values provided by these third parties on a quarterly basis and challenges prices when it believes a discrepancy in pricing exists. Based on Peoples' past experience, no discrepancies have been noted related to current pricing and values.\nImpaired loans\nFor loans considered impaired, the amount of impairment loss recognized is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is expected solely from the sale of the collateral. Management typically relies on the fair value of the underlying collateral due to the significant uncertainty surrounding the borrower's ability to make future payments. The vast majority of the collateral securing impaired loans is real estate, although the collateral may also include accounts receivable and equipment, inventory or similar personal property. The fair value of the collateral used by management represents the estimated proceeds to be received from the sale of the\ncollateral, less costs incurred during the sale, based upon observable market data or market value data provided by independent, licensed or certified appraisers.\nServicing Rights\nSRs are carried at the lower of amortized cost or market value, and, therefore, can be subject to fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis. SRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. Thus, management determines fair value based upon a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income provided by an independent third-party consultant. This valuation model is affected by various input factors, such as servicing costs, expected prepayment speeds and discount rates, which are subject to change between reporting periods. As a result, significant changes to these factors could result in a material change to the calculated fair value of SRs.\nTo determine the fair value of its servicing rights ( SRs\u201d) each reporting quarter, Peoples provides information representing loan information accompanied by escrow amounts to a third-party valuation firm. The third-party then evaluates the possible impairment of SRs as described below. Loans are evaluated on a discounted earnings basis to determine the present value of future earnings that Peoples expects to realize from the portfolio. Earnings are projected from a variety of sources including loan service fees, net interest earned on escrow balances, miscellaneous income and costs to service the loans. The present value of future earnings is the estimated fair value, calculated using consensus assumptions that a third-party purchaser would utilize in evaluating a potential acquisition of the SRs.\nEvents that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates and the related impact on mortgage loan prepayment speeds, and the payment performance of the underlying loans. Peoples believes this methodology provides a reasonable estimate. Mortgage loan prepayment estimates were determined through the application of the current dealer projected prepayment rates by product type and interest rate as published by Bloomberg, L.P. as of January 4, 2016, and adjusted for historical prepayment factors based on state, type of servicing, year of origination, and pass through coupon. The adjustable rate mortgage loan prepayment estimates were determined through the application of market trading assumptions as of January 4, 2016, and adjusted for historical prepayment factors based on state, type of servicing, year of origination, and pass through coupon.\nThese earnings are used to calculate the approximate cash flow that could be received from the servicing portfolio. Valuation results are provided quarterly to Peoples. At that time, Peoples reviews the information and SRs are marked to the lower of amortized cost or fair value for the current quarter.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $10.9 million, compared to $16.7 million in 2014 and $17.6 million in 2013, representing earnings per diluted common share of $0.61, $1.35 and $1.63, respectively. The decrease in earnings during 2015 was primarily driven by provision for loan losses of $14.1 million coupled with $11.3 million of acquisition-related costs. The decrease in 2014 from 2013 was primarily driven by acquisition-related costs of $5.1 million and pension settlement charges of $1.4 million. Earnings in 2013 were impacted by additional operating costs associated with various strategic investments to grow revenue and a lower recovery of loan losses.\nIn 2015, Peoples had a provision for loan losses of $14.1 million related primarily to the charge-off of one large commercial loan relationship coupled with loan growth and downward trends in criticized loans. Peoples recorded net charge-offs of $15.2 million for 2015, compared to net recoveries of $0.5 million and $3.7 million, respectively, for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The provision for or recovery of loan losses represented amounts needed, in management's opinion, to maintain the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.\nYear-over-year income and expense was largely effected by the acquisitions completed in 2014 and 2015. In 2014, Peoples acquired Midwest on May 30, Ohio Heritage on August 22, and North Akron on October 24, and in 2015, Peoples acquired NB&T on March 6. Due to the timing of the acquisitions, 2015 included a full year impact of the 2014 acquisitions compared to only a partial impact in 2014. In 2015, NB&T income and expenses were included beginning on March 6, 2015.\nNet interest income grew 40% to $97.6 million in 2015 compared to $69.5 million in 2014 and $55.4 million in 2013, mostly due to higher loan balances in connection with the recent acquisitions, coupled with organic loan growth. Net interest margin was 3.53% in 2015, higher than the 3.45% in 2014 and 3.23% in 2013. The increase in 2015 was due to accretion income from the completed acquisitions, organic loan growth, change in asset mix and a reduction in funding costs. Accretion income from acquisitions added approximately 17 basis points to net interest margin in 2015 compared to 13 basis points in 2014 and 4 basis points in 2013. The increase in net interest margin in 2014 was mostly due to higher loan balances in connection with acquisitions and organic loan growth. The decrease in net interest margin during 2013 was largely a result of the low interest rate environment, which put downward pressure on asset yields.\nTotal non-interest income, which excludes gains and losses on investment securities, asset disposals and other transactions, increased 18% in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased 8% comparing 2014 to 2013. During 2015, electronic banking income grew 35%, or $2.3 million, trust and investment income increased 25%, or $1.9 million, service charges on\ndeposit accounts grew 18%, or $1.7 million and bank owned life insurance income increased $0.5 million. The noted increases reflected a full year of income from the 2014 acquisitions and approximately nine months of income related to the NB&T acquisition.\nTotal other expense increased 35%, or $30.1 million, for the year ended December 31, 2015, due largely to a full year of expenses related to the 2014 acquisitions and approximately nine months of expenses related to the NB&T acquisition. The NB&T acquisition added 22 additional branches which increased net occupancy and equipment, higher salaries and employee benefits, due to additional employees, increased intangible asset amortization and increased electronic banking expense. Acquisition-related expenses included in other expenses during 2015 were $10.7 million, compared to $4.8 million in 2014 and $1.4 million in 2013.\nAt December 31, 2015, total assets were up 27%, or $691.2 million to $3.26 billion versus $2.57 billion at year-end 2014. The increase was primarily related to the acquisition of $710.5 million in assets during 2015. Excluding the impact of the loans acquired in the NB&T acquisition, loan balances grew 7% or $451.6 million for the year. The allowance for loan losses decreased $1.1 million to $16.8 million, or 1.19% of originated loans, net of deferred fees and costs, compared to $17.9 million and 1.48% at December 31, 2014. Total investment securities grew to $868.8 million, or 26.7% of total assets at December 31, 2015, compared to $713.7 million, or 27.8% of total assets at the prior year-end.\nTotal liabilities were $2.84 billion at December 31, 2015, up $611.5 million since December 31, 2014. Contributing to this increase were acquired deposits of approximately $629.5 million. Non-interest-bearing deposits comprised 28.7% of total retail deposits at December 31, 2015, versus 26.0% at year-end 2014. At December 31, 2015, total borrowed funds were $274.1 million, up $6.7 million compared to the prior year-end, as Peoples assumed $6.6 million from the NB&T acquisition.\nAt December 31, 2015, total stockholders' equity was $419.8 million, up $79.7 million from December 31, 2014. The increase in common stock within total stockholders' equity was primarily due to the common shares issued in connection with 2015 acquisition of NB&T which had a value of $76.0 million. Peoples' regulatory capital ratios remained significantly higher than \"well capitalized\" minimums. Peoples' Tier 1 Capital ratio decreased to 13.68% at December 31, 2015, versus 14.32% at December 31, 2014, while the Total Capital ratio was 14.55% versus 15.48% at December 31, 2014. In addition, Peoples' tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.69% and tangible book value per share was $14.68 at December 31, 2015, versus 9.39% and $15.57 at December 31, 2014, respectively. Additional information regarding capital requirements can be found in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInterest Income and Expense\nPeoples earns interest income on loans and investments and incurs interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income, the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense, remains Peoples' largest source of revenue. The amount of net interest income earned by Peoples is affected by various factors, including changes in market interest rates due to the Federal Reserve Board's monetary policy, the level and degree of pricing competition for both loans and deposits in Peoples' markets, and the amount and composition of Peoples' earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nPeoples monitors net interest income performance and manages its balance sheet composition through regular ALCO meetings. The asset-liability management process employed by the ALCO is intended to mitigate the impact of future interest rate changes on Peoples' net interest income and earnings. However, the frequency and/or magnitude of changes in market interest rates are difficult to predict, and may have a greater impact on net interest income than adjustments management is able to make.\nThe following table details Peoples' average balance sheets for the years ended December 31:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

changes in each.\n (2) Interest income and yields are presented on a fully tax-equivalent basis using a 35% federal statutory tax rate.  As part of the analysis of net interest income, management converts tax-exempt income earned on obligations of states and political subdivisions to the pre-tax equivalent of taxable income using an effective tax rate of 35%. Management believes the resulting FTE net interest income allows for a more meaningful comparison of tax-exempt income and yields to their taxable equivalents. Net interest margin, which is calculated by dividing FTE net interest income by average interest-\nearning assets, serves as an important measurement of the net revenue stream generated by the volume, mix and pricing of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nThe following table details the calculation of FTE net interest income for the years ended December 31:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income, as reported\n</td> <td>97,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxable equivalent adjustments\n</td> <td>1,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fully tax-equivalent net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2015, Peoples recognized accretion income, net of amortization expense, from acquisitions of $4.8 million, which added approximately 17 basis points to net interest margin, compared to $2.6 million and 13 basis points, and $0.7 million and 4 basis points in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Also during 2015, additional interest income from prepayment fees and interest recovered on nonaccrual loans was $591,000 compared to $240,000 in 2014 and $976,000 in 2013. The primary driver of the increase in net interest income during 2015 was the higher loan balances resulting from organic growth and acquired loans.\nThe yield on investment securities decreased in 2015 as interest rates fell and prepayment speeds on mortgage-backed securities increased. The increase in prepayment speeds was due primarily to greater mortgage refinancing activity driven by lower interest rates. This resulted in higher monthly principal cashflows in the investment portfolio. In 2015, the average monthly principal cashflow was approximately $10.1 million compared to $6.0 million in 2014 and $8.0 million in 2013.\nFunding costs have declined since 2013 as Peoples executed a strategy of replacing higher-cost funding with low-cost deposits. In 2015, funding costs decreased 18 basis points, compared to15 basis points in 2014 and 27 basis points in 2013. Additional improvement was due to deploying excess cash on the balance sheet by buying securities in the investment portfolio and paying off a $12.0 million term loan. The continued increase in the balance of low-cost deposits has provided funding for loan growth during these periods.\nDetailed information regarding changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets can be found under appropriate captions of the FINANCIAL CONDITION\u201d section of this discussion.

This process considers various factors that affect losses, such as changes in Peoples' loan quality, historical loss experience and current economic conditions. The provision for loan losses recorded in 2015 was primarily due to the charge-off of one large commercial loan relationship coupled with organic loan growth and downward trends in criticized loans. The provision for loan losses recorded in 2014 was driven by checking account overdrafts, while the impact of increases in criticized loans was mitigated by $1.8 million of recoveries on three loans that were previously charged off. The recovery of loan losses recorded during 2013 was driven mostly by recoveries on commercial real estate loans that had previously incurred charge-offs.\nAdditional information regarding changes in the allowance for loan losses and loan credit quality can be found later in this discussion under the caption Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d.\nNet Loss on Asset Disposals and Other Transactions\nThe following table details the other (losses) gains for the years ended December 31 recognized by Peoples:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) gain on OREO\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(68\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) gain on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>(520\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss on bank premises and equipment\n</td> <td>(696\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(430\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(241\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on other assets\n</td> <td>(43\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss on asset disposals and other transactions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,788\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(431\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(155\n</td> <td>)\n</td>"}
