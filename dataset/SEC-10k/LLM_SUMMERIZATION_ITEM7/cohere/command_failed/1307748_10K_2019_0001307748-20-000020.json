Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis relates to the operations of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and its financial position as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Discussion of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Annual Report can be found in \"Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report.\nExecutive Summary\nInvenTrust Properties Corp. is a premier multi-tenant retail REIT that owns, leases, redevelops, acquires and manages grocery-anchored neighborhood centers, and select power centers that often have a grocery component, in Sun Belt markets with favorable demographics. We seek to continue to execute our strategy to enhance our multi-tenant retail platform by further investing in grocery-anchored centers with essential retail in our current markets, while exhibiting focused and disciplined capital allocation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we continued to execute on our strategy by opportunistically disposing of properties not located in our identified markets or where we believe the properties' values have been maximized. Our strategy is to redeploy the proceeds from these sales with a disciplined approach into strategic retail properties in our target markets. However, we face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities. As a result of this competition, the purchase prices for attractive and suitable assets may be significantly elevated and may adversely impact our ability to redeploy the proceeds from property sales for reinvestment. In addition, our disposition activity could continue to cause us to experience dilution in financial operating performance during the period in which we dispose of properties.\nIn evaluating our financial condition and operating performance, management focuses on the following financial and non-financial indicators, discussed in further detail herein:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Property net operating income (\"NOI\"), which excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, provision for asset impairment, interest, dividend and other income, gains (losses) from sales of properties, gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt, interest expense, net, equity in earnings (losses) and (impairment), net, from unconsolidated entities, and realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities, net;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Modified NOI, a supplemental measure not determined in accordance with GAAP, which reflects property NOI exclusive of lease termination income and GAAP rent adjustments (such as straight-line rent, above/below market lease amortization and amortization of lease incentives);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>FFO Applicable to Common Shares, a supplemental non-GAAP measure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Modified FFO Applicable to Common Shares, a supplemental non-GAAP measure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Economic and physical occupancy and rental rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Leasing activity and lease rollover;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Management of operating expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Management of general and administrative expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Debt maturities and leverage ratios; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Liquidity levels.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Multi-Tenant Retail Portfolio\nOur wholly-owned, consolidated and managed retail properties include grocery-anchored community and neighborhood centers and power centers, including those classified as necessity-based.

Joint Venture Interest\nOn June 24, 2019, we liquidated all interests in Downtown Railyard Venture, LLC (\"DRV\"), a joint venture established for the purpose of developing and selling a land development in Sacramento, California, in exchange for $30.0 million of cash consideration. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $29.9 million on DRV due to a reduction in the expected hold period, thereby reducing the investment to an estimated fair value that we believed would be most probable of realization if the investment was liquidated. As a result of the other-than-temporary impairment, the liquidation of interests resulted in no gain or loss being recognized on the transaction during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nUniversity House Communities Group, Inc., Indemnity Claims\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized additional losses, within discontinued operations, of $25.5 million as a result of the final settlement related to indemnity claims between UHC Acquisition Sub LLC (\"UHC\") and the Company.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn November 1, 2019, we adopted the Share Repurchase Program, authorizing redemption of the Company's shares of common stock, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to provide limited liquidity to qualifying stockholders. Our obligation to repurchase any shares under the Share Repurchase Program was conditioned upon our having sufficient funds available to complete the repurchase. The repurchase price per share for all stockholders is equal to a 25% discount to the most recent estimated NAV per share of our common stock established by our Board, which was $3.14 per share as of May 1, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 8,517,605 shares were repurchased in connection with the Program. The price per share for all shares repurchased was $2.355 for aggregate consideration of $20.1 million.\nAmended and Restated Distribution Reinvestment Plan\nOn November 1, 2019, we began offering shares of our common stock to our existing stockholders pursuant to the DRP. Under the DRP, stockholders may elect to reinvest an amount equal to the distributions declared on their shares of common stock into additional shares of our common stock in lieu of receiving cash distributions. In accordance with the DRP, participants may acquire shares of common stock at a 25% discount to the most recent estimated NAV per share of our common stock established by our Board, which was $3.14 per share as of May 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the DRP purchase price was $2.355 per share. In connection with the DRP, in January 2020, we sold a total of 21,249 shares and generated $0.05 million in gross offering proceeds under the DRP.\nDistribution rate\nOn November 11, 2019, our Board approved an increase to our annual distribution rate effective for the quarterly distribution payable in April 2020, from $0.0737 to $0.0759 per share annualized.\nRecent Activities\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we have evaluated events and transactions occurring after December 31, 2019, through the date the financial statements were issued for recognition and disclosure purposes.\nCurrent Strategy and Outlook\nInvenTrust focuses on grocery-anchored neighborhood centers, and select power centers that often have a grocery component, in markets with favorable demographics, including above average growth in population, employment and income. We believe these conditions create favorable demand characteristics for grocery-anchored and necessity-based retail centers which will enable us to capitalize on potential future rent increases while enjoying sustained occupancy at our centers. Using these criteria, we have identified 15 to 20 markets within the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Houston, the greater Los Angeles and San Diego areas, Miami, Orlando, Raleigh-Durham, San Antonio and Tampa.\nWe have a coordinated program to increase rental income by maximizing existing re-development opportunities and identifying locations in our current multi-tenant retail platform where we can increase the overall square footage of the property. In addition, we work with our tenants to expand rentable square footage at select retail properties where demand warrants additional supply. In addition, due to our properties as both retail centers and community focal points, we are able to identify short-term and specialty leasing opportunities that generate revenue from areas of the properties which are typically vacant.\nOur grocery-anchored neighborhood centers bring consumers to our well-located properties, while our larger-format necessity-based power center retailers continue to adapt their business models to embrace omni-channel retail and appeal to consumers' continuing focus on value. Our property management team is focused on enhancing the consumer shopping experience at our centers by maintaining strong tenant relationships, controlling expenses, and investing in sustainability programs at a number of our retail properties with initiatives such as LED lighting, trash recycling, water conservation and other programs to reduce energy consumption and expenses.\nIn addition, our leasing staff continues to focus on leasing space at our retail properties at favorable rental rates while establishing a more favorable tenant mix and identifying complementary uses to maximize tenant performance. We believe our strong locations have allowed and will continue to allow us to backfill the vacancies created by such tenants.\nWe believe the refinement of our multi-tenant retail platform has positioned us for future success and will allow us to evaluate and ultimately execute on a potential strategic transaction, achieve liquidity for and provide a return of capital to our stockholders in the long term. While we believe in our ability to execute on our plan, the timing is uncertain and may be shortened or extended by external and macroeconomic factors including, among others, interest rate movements, local, regional, national and global economic performance, competitive factors, the impact of e-commerce on the retail industry, future retailer store closings, retailer consolidation, retailers reducing store size, retailer bankruptcies, and government policy changes.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following section describes and compares our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. We generate substantially all of our net income from property operations. Since January 1, 2018, we have acquired 11 retail properties and disposed of 24 retail properties and transferred two retail properties to their lenders in satisfaction of non-recourse debt. All dollar amounts shown in the following tables are stated in thousands unless otherwise noted.\nThe following table presents the changes in our income.\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td>

comparing the year ended December 31, 2019, to the same period in 2018. Approximately $3.0 million of this increase in modified NOI is attributed to base rent increases resulting from leasing previously unoccupied space and achieving more favorable rent terms with tenants. The remaining increase is the result of an increase in other property income of $0.7 million which was offset by an increase of $1.7 million in non-recoverable operating expenses. Included in the $4.1 million increase is $1.1 million related to the strategic acquisition of an adjacent portion of an existing shopping center that expanded GLA at a property classified as same-property.\nFunds From Operations\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), an industry trade group, has promulgated a standard known as Funds From Operations (\"FFO\"). Our FFO, based on the NAREIT definition, is net income (or loss) in accordance with GAAP excluding gains (or losses) resulting from dispositions of properties, plus depreciation and amortization and impairment charges on depreciable real property, after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures in which we hold an interest. We have adopted the NAREIT definition in our calculation of FFO Applicable to Common Shares because management considers FFO a widely accepted and appropriate non-GAAP measure of performance for REITs.\nIn calculating FFO, impairment charges of depreciable real estate assets are added back even though the impairment charge may represent a permanent decline in value due to the decreased operating performance of the applicable property. Furthermore, because gains and losses from sales of property are excluded from FFO, it is consistent and appropriate that impairments, which are often early recognition of losses on prospective sales of property, also be excluded. If evidence exists that a loss reflected in the investment of an unconsolidated entity is due to the impairment of depreciable real estate assets, our share of these impairments is added back to net income in the determination of FFO.\nModified Funds From Operations (\"Modified FFO\") is an additional financial measure we use because FFO includes certain non-comparable items that affect our performance over time. We define Modified FFO as FFO Applicable to Common Shares excluding the impact of discrete non-operating transactions and other events, which we do not deem representative of the comparable operating results of our multi-tenant retail platform.\nWe believe FFO Applicable to Common Shares provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of our financial performance that is not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe that Modified FFO extends that perspective and is helpful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future periods by excluding items that may cause short-term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on operating cash flows.\nFFO and Modified FFO are intended to be neither a substitute for \"net income\" nor a substitute for \"cash flows from operating activities\" as determined by GAAP. Other REITs may use alternative methodologies for calculating similarly titled measures, which may not be comparable to our calculation of FFO Applicable to Common Shares or Modified FFO Applicable to Common Shares.\nFFO Applicable to Common Shares and Modified FFO Applicable to Common Shares are calculated as follows: Table 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization related to investment properties\n</td> <td>94,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Our share of depreciation and amortization recognized in equity in earnings (losses) and (impairment), net, of unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>11,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for asset impairment\n</td> <td>2,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Our share of provision for asset impairment recognized in equity in earnings (losses) and (impairment), net, of unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale and transfer of investment properties, net\n</td> <td>(62,011\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95,097\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Our share of losses from property dispositions recognized in equity in earnings (losses) and (impairment), net, of unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO Applicable to Common Shares\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(244\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, net\n</td> <td>2,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of mark to market debt, premium, and discount, net\n</td> <td>(202\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(202\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of above and below-market leases and lease inducements, net\n</td> <td>(6,148\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,347\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization of corporate assets\n</td> <td>3,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight-line rent adjustment, net\n</td> <td>(3,464\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,262\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Our share of straight-line rent adjustment, net, recognized in equity in earnings (losses) and (impairment), net, of unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(538\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation, net\n</td> <td>5,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for indemnification claims in discontinued operations\n</td> <td>25,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Modified FFO Applicable to Common Shares\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are required in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, evaluating the impairment of long-lived assets, allocating the purchase price of acquired retail properties, determining the fair value of debt and evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable. We base these estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nConsolidation\nWe evaluate our investments in LLCs and LPs to determine whether each such entity may be a VIE. The accounting standards related to the consolidation of VIEs require qualitative assessments to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. Determination of the primary beneficiary is based on whether we have (i) power to direct significant activities of the VIE and (ii) an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We consolidate a VIE if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The equity method of accounting is applied to entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary, or the entity is not a VIE and we do not have control, but can exercise influence over the entity with respect to its operations and major decisions. Our ability to correctly assess control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nLease Income\nFixed consideration, generally consisting of minimum lease payments, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of each lease. The cumulative difference between fixed consideration recognized on a straight-line basis and the cash payments due under the provisions of the lease agreements is recorded as deferred rent receivable and is included as a component of accounts and rents receivable on the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe commence revenue recognition on leases when the lessee takes possession of, or controls the physical use of, the leased asset, unless the lessee is constructing improvements for which we are deemed to be the owner for accounting purposes. If we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes, the leased asset is the finished space and revenue recognition commences when the lessee takes possession of it, typically when the improvements are substantially complete. Alternatively, if the lessee is deemed to be the owner of the improvements for accounting purposes, then the leased asset is the unimproved space, and any tenant improvement allowances funded under the lease are treated as lease incentives which reduce lease income recognized over the lease term, and we commence revenue recognition when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space.\nThe determination of who owns the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, is based on contractual rights and subject to judgment. In making that judgment, no one factor is determinative. We routinely consider:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether the tenant is required to provide evidence supporting the cost of improvements prior to reimbursement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the uniqueness of the improvements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the expected economic life of the tenant improvements relative to the length of the lease; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>who constructs or directs the construction of the improvements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Sale of Real Estate\nWe derecognize real estate and recognize a gain or loss when a contract exists and control of the property has transferred to the buyer. Control of the property, including controlling financial interest, is generally considered to transfer upon closing through transfer of the legal title and possession of the property, at which point we recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the transaction price and the carrying amount of the property.\nAcquisition of Real Estate\nWe evaluate the inputs, processes and outputs of each asset acquired to determine if the transaction is a business combination or asset acquisition. If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are generally capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets.\nWe allocate the purchase price of real estate to land, building, other building improvements, tenant improvements, intangible assets and liabilities (such as the value of above- and below-market leases, in-place leases and origination costs associated with in-place leases). The values of above- and below-market leases are recorded as intangible assets, net, and intangible liabilities, net, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets, and are amortized as either a decrease (in the case of above-market leases) or an increase (in the case of below-market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated tenant lease. The values, if any, associated with in-place leases are recorded in intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to depreciation and amortization expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income over the remaining lease term.\nThe difference between the contractual rental rates and our estimate of market rental rates is measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the leases plus the term of any below-market renewal options. For the amortization period, the remaining term of leases with renewal options at terms below market reflect the assumed exercise of such below-market renewal options, if reasonably assured.\nIf a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual expiration of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangible asset or liability is written off. Tenant improvements are depreciated and origination costs are amortized over the remaining term of the lease or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date.\nWe perform, with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, the following procedures for assets acquired:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Estimate the value of the property \"as if vacant\" as of the acquisition date;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Allocate the value of the property among land, building, and other building improvements and determine the associated useful life for each;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Calculate the value and associated life of above- and below-market leases on a tenant-by-tenant basis.

If it is determined that the carrying value is not recoverable because the expected undiscounted cash flows do not exceed that carrying value, we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. The valuation and possible subsequent impairment of investment properties is a significant estimate that can and does change based on our continuous process of analyzing each property's economic condition at a point in time and reviewing assumptions about uncertain inherent factors, including observable inputs such as contractual revenues and unobservable inputs such as forecasted revenues and expenses, estimated net disposition proceeds, and discount rate. These unobservable inputs are based on market conditions and our expected growth rates.\nHowever, assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions and in our ultimate investment intent that occur subsequent to the impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in additional impairment of the investment properties.\nPeriodically, we assesses whether there are any indicators that the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated entities may be other-than-temporarily impaired. To the extent other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. The estimated fair value of the investment is generally derived from the cash flows generated from the investee's underlying real property investments.\nReal Estate Capitalization and Depreciation\nReal estate is reflected at cost less accumulated depreciation within investment property on the consolidated balance sheets. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nDepreciation expense is computed using the straight line method. Buildings are depreciated based upon an estimated useful life of 30 years, and 5-15 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment and site improvements. Finance lease assets are generally amortized using the straight-line method over the lease term. Finance lease asset amortization is included in depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nTenant improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the life of the tenant improvement or the lease term and is included in depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nDirect and indirect costs that are clearly related to the construction and improvements of investment properties are capitalized. Costs incurred for property taxes and insurance are capitalized during periods in which activities necessary to prepare the property for its intended use are in progress. Interest costs are also capitalized during such periods.\nIncome Taxes\nWe qualify and have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for federal income tax purposes commencing with the tax year ended December 31, 2005. Since we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that is distributed to stockholders. A REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to its stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, without the benefit of certain relief provisions, we will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income, property or net worth and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. We have elected to treat certain of our consolidated subsidiaries, and may in the future elect to treat newly formed subsidiaries, as TRSs pursuant to the Code. Among other activities, TRSs may participate in non-real estate related activities and/or perform non-customary services for tenants and are subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate tax rates.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDevelopment, Re-development, Capital Expenditures and Leasing Activities\nThe following table summarizes capital resources used through development and re-development, capital expenditures and leasing activities at the Company's retail properties owned during the year ended December 31, 2019.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements from cash flows from operations, distributions from our joint venture investment, sales of our retail properties and available capacity on our revolving credit agreements.\nLong-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur objectives are to maximize revenue generated by our multi-tenant retail platform, to further enhance the value of our retail properties to produce attractive current yield and long-term returns for our stockholders, and to generate sustainable and predictable cash flow from our operations to distribute to our stockholders. We are seeking to increase our operating cash flows over time through the execution of our strategy.\nOur Board approved an increase to our annual distribution rate effective for the quarterly distribution paid in April 2019. As we execute our retail strategy, the Board has evaluated and will continue to evaluate our distribution rate and, if the Board deems appropriate, adjust the rate to take into account our progress in refining and balancing our multi-tenant retail platform.

We maintain our cash and cash equivalents at major financial institutions. The combined account balances at one or more institutions generally exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") insurance coverage. The Company periodically assesses the credit risk associated with these financial institutions. As a result, there is what we believe to be insignificant credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions of Real Estate Investments\nIn 2019, we acquired seven retail properties and a building and two retail parcels adjacent to three existing retail properties. In 2018, we acquired three retail properties, including one retail property classified as a consolidated VIE, and the acquisition of two retail parcels adjacent to two existing retail properties. These acquisitions were funded with available cash, disposition\nproceeds, and mortgage indebtedness. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we invested net cash of approximately $359.1 million and $220.8 million, respectively, for these acquisitions.\nIn 2019, we disposed of ten retail properties. In 2018, we disposed of 16 retail properties, including the surrender of two properties to their respective lenders in satisfaction of non-recourse debt, and completed a partial condemnation at one retail property for an aggregate gross disposition price of $466.2 million.\nDistributions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we declared cash distributions to our stockholders totaling $53.5 million and paid cash distributions of $53.3 million.\nAs we execute on our retail strategy, the Board evaluated and expects to continue to evaluate our distribution rate on a periodic basis. See \"Part I. Item 1. Business - Current Strategy and Outlook\" for more information regarding our retail strategy.

Our obligation to repurchase any shares under the Share Repurchase Program was conditioned upon our having sufficient funds available to complete the repurchase. The repurchase price per share for all stockholders is equal to a 25% discount to the most recent estimated NAV per share of our common stock established by our Board, which was $3.14 per share as of May 1, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 8,517,605 shares were repurchased in connection with the Share Repurchase Program. The price per share for all shares repurchased was $2.355.\nAmended and Restated Distribution Reinvestment Plan\nOn November 1, 2019, we began offering shares of our common stock to our existing stockholders pursuant to the DRP. Under the DRP, stockholders may elect to reinvest an amount equal to the distributions declared on their shares of common stock into additional shares of our common stock in lieu of receiving cash distributions. In accordance with the DRP, participants may acquire shares of common stock at a 25% discount to the most recent estimated NAV per share of our common stock established by our Board, which was $3.14 per share as of May 1, 2019. In connection with the DRP, in January 2020, we sold a total of 21,249 shares and generated $0.05 million in gross offering proceeds under the DRP.\nBorrowings\nMortgages Payable, Maturities\nThe following table shows the scheduled maturities for the Company's mortgages payable as of December 31, 2019, for each of the next five years and thereafter: Table 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Maturities during the year ending December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgages payable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit agreements, maturities\nThe following table shows the Company's outstanding borrowings under its unsecured term loans as of December 31, 2019.\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Principal Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$250.0 million 5 year - swapped to fixed rate (a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6795%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 21, 2023\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$250.0 million 5 year - swapped to fixed rate (a)\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6795%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 21, 2023\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$250.0 million 5 year - variable rate (b)\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8911%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 21, 2023\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$150.0 million 5.5 year - swapped to fixed rate (a)\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6915%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 21, 2024\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$150.0 million 5.5 year - swapped to fixed rate (a)\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6990%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 21, 2024\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$150.0 million 5.5 year - variable rate (b)\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8911%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 21, 2024\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total unsecured term loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>During the third quarter of 2019, the Company entered into four interest rate swap agreements which effectively replaced the two interest rate swaps which terminated on December 1, 2019.

With respect to current economic conditions and governmental fiscal policy, inflation may become a greater risk. Our leases typically require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. By sharing these costs with our tenants, we may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. A portion of our leases also include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents based on a tenant's gross sales above predetermined levels or escalation clauses which are typically related to increases in the Consumer Price Index or similar inflation indices. Furthermore, many of our leases are for terms of 10 years or less, allowing us to seek to adjust rents upon renewal.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am unable to identify exactly what you are asking for.\n- Could you please provide additional details or clarification regarding your request?\n- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I do not have the necessary information or capabilities to do so.\n- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis relates to the operations of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and its financial position as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Discussion of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Annual Report can be found in \"Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report.\nExecutive Summary\nInvenTrust Properties Corp. is a premier multi-tenant retail REIT that owns, leases, redevelops, acquires and manages grocery-anchored neighborhood centers, and select power centers that often have a grocery component, in Sun Belt markets with favorable demographics. We seek to continue to execute our strategy to enhance our multi-tenant retail platform by further investing in grocery-anchored centers with essential retail in our current markets, while exhibiting focused and disciplined capital allocation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we continued to execute on our strategy by opportunistically disposing of properties not located in our identified markets or where we believe the properties' values have been maximized. Our strategy is to redeploy the proceeds from these sales with a disciplined approach into strategic retail properties in our target markets. However, we face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities. As a result of this competition, the purchase prices for attractive and suitable assets may be significantly elevated and may adversely impact our ability to redeploy the proceeds from property sales for reinvestment. In addition, our disposition activity could continue to cause us to experience dilution in financial operating performance during the period in which we dispose of properties.\nIn evaluating our financial condition and operating performance, management focuses on the following financial and non-financial indicators, discussed in further detail herein:\n \u2022 Property net operating income (\"NOI\"), which excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, provision for asset impairment, interest, dividend and other income, gains (losses) from sales of properties, gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt, interest expense, net, equity in earnings (losses) and (impairment), net, from unconsolidated entities, and realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities, net; \n \u2022 Modified NOI, a supplemental measure not determined in accordance with GAAP, which reflects property NOI exclusive of lease termination income and GAAP rent adjustments (such as straight-line rent, above/below market lease amortization and amortization of lease incentives); \n \u2022 FFO Applicable to Common Shares, a supplemental non-GAAP measure; \n \u2022 Modified FFO Applicable to Common Shares, a supplemental non-GAAP measure; \n \u2022 Cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP; \n \u2022 Economic and physical occupancy and rental rates; \n \u2022 Leasing activity and lease rollover; \n \u2022 Management of operating expenses; \n \u2022 Management of general and administrative expenses; \n \u2022 Debt maturities and leverage ratios; and \n \u2022 Liquidity levels. \nOur Multi-Tenant Retail Portfolio\nOur wholly-owned, consolidated and managed retail properties include grocery-anchored community and neighborhood centers and power centers, including those classified as necessity-based. As of December 31, 2019, we owned 65 retail properties with a GLA of approximately 10.9 million square feet, which includes 11 retail properties with a GLA of approximately 2.6 million square feet owned through the Company's ownership interest in an unconsolidated joint venture, IAGM. The following table summarizes our multi-tenant retail portfolio as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. \nMulti-Tenant Retail Portfolio Summary by Center Type\nThe following tables summarize our multi-tenant retail portfolio, by center type, as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. \n\nSame-Property Multi-Tenant Retail Portfolio Summary\nThe following table summarizes the GLA, economic occupancy and ABR per square foot of the properties included in our multi-tenant retail portfolio classified as same-property for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The properties classified as same-property were owned for the entirety of both periods presented. \nLeasing Activity\nThe following table summarizes the leasing activity for leases that were executed during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with expiring or expired leases for the same or previous tenant for renewals and the same unit for new leases at the 65 retail properties in our multi-tenant retail portfolio. We had GLA totaling 1,312,882 square feet expiring during the year ended December 31, 2019, of which 960,758 square feet was re-leased. This achieved a retention rate of approximately 73.2%. \n (a) Comparable leases are leases that meet all of the following criteria: terms greater than one year, unit was vacant one year or less prior to occupancy, square footage of unit remains unchanged or within 10% of prior unit square footage, and has a rent structure consistent with the previous tenant. \n (b) Non-comparable leases are not included in totals. \nHighlights for the year ended December 31, 2019\nLiquidation of Joint Venture Interest\nOn June 24, 2019, we liquidated all interests in Downtown Railyard Venture, LLC (\"DRV\"), a joint venture established for the purpose of developing and selling a land development in Sacramento, California, in exchange for $30.0 million of cash consideration. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $29.9 million on DRV due to a reduction in the expected hold period, thereby reducing the investment to an estimated fair value that we believed would be most probable of realization if the investment was liquidated. As a result of the other-than-temporary impairment, the liquidation of interests resulted in no gain or loss being recognized on the transaction during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nUniversity House Communities Group, Inc., Indemnity Claims\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized additional losses, within discontinued operations, of $25.5 million as a result of the final settlement related to indemnity claims between UHC Acquisition Sub LLC (\"UHC\") and the Company.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn November 1, 2019, we adopted the Share Repurchase Program, authorizing redemption of the Company's shares of common stock, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to provide limited liquidity to qualifying stockholders. Our obligation to repurchase any shares under the Share Repurchase Program was conditioned upon our having sufficient funds available to complete the repurchase. The repurchase price per share for all stockholders is equal to a 25% discount to the most recent estimated NAV per share of our common stock established by our Board, which was $3.14 per share as of May 1, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 8,517,605 shares were repurchased in connection with the Program. The price per share for all shares repurchased was $2.355 for aggregate consideration of $20.1 million.\nAmended and Restated Distribution Reinvestment Plan\nOn November 1, 2019, we began offering shares of our common stock to our existing stockholders pursuant to the DRP. Under the DRP, stockholders may elect to reinvest an amount equal to the distributions declared on their shares of common stock into additional shares of our common stock in lieu of receiving cash distributions. In accordance with the DRP, participants may acquire shares of common stock at a 25% discount to the most recent estimated NAV per share of our common stock established by our Board, which was $3.14 per share as of May 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the DRP purchase price was $2.355 per share. In connection with the DRP, in January 2020, we sold a total of 21,249 shares and generated $0.05 million in gross offering proceeds under the DRP.\nDistribution rate\nOn November 11, 2019, our Board approved an increase to our annual distribution rate effective for the quarterly distribution payable in April 2020, from $0.0737 to $0.0759 per share annualized.\nRecent Activities\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we have evaluated events and transactions occurring after December 31, 2019, through the date the financial statements were issued for recognition and disclosure purposes.\nCurrent Strategy and Outlook\nInvenTrust focuses on grocery-anchored neighborhood centers, and select power centers that often have a grocery component, in markets with favorable demographics, including above average growth in population, employment and income. We believe these conditions create favorable demand characteristics for grocery-anchored and necessity-based retail centers which will enable us to capitalize on potential future rent increases while enjoying sustained occupancy at our centers. Using these criteria, we have identified 15 to 20 markets within the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Houston, the greater Los Angeles and San Diego areas, Miami, Orlando, Raleigh-Durham, San Antonio and Tampa.\nWe have a coordinated program to increase rental income by maximizing existing re-development opportunities and identifying locations in our current multi-tenant retail platform where we can increase the overall square footage of the property. In addition, we work with our tenants to expand rentable square footage at select retail properties where demand warrants additional supply. In addition, due to our properties as both retail centers and community focal points, we are able to identify short-term and specialty leasing opportunities that generate revenue from areas of the properties which are typically vacant.\nOur grocery-anchored neighborhood centers bring consumers to our well-located properties, while our larger-format necessity-based power center retailers continue to adapt their business models to embrace omni-channel retail and appeal to consumers' continuing focus on value. Our property management team is focused on enhancing the consumer shopping experience at our centers by maintaining strong tenant relationships, controlling expenses, and investing in sustainability programs at a number of our retail properties with initiatives such as LED lighting, trash recycling, water conservation and other programs to reduce energy consumption and expenses.\nIn addition, our leasing staff continues to focus on leasing space at our retail properties at favorable rental rates while establishing a more favorable tenant mix and identifying complementary uses to maximize tenant performance. We believe our strong locations have allowed and will continue to allow us to backfill the vacancies created by such tenants.\nWe believe the refinement of our multi-tenant retail platform has positioned us for future success and will allow us to evaluate and ultimately execute on a potential strategic transaction, achieve liquidity for and provide a return of capital to our stockholders in the long term. While we believe in our ability to execute on our plan, the timing is uncertain and may be shortened or extended by external and macroeconomic factors including, among others, interest rate movements, local, regional, national and global economic performance, competitive factors, the impact of e-commerce on the retail industry, future retailer store closings, retailer consolidation, retailers reducing store size, retailer bankruptcies, and government policy changes.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following section describes and compares our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. We generate substantially all of our net income from property operations. Since January 1, 2018, we have acquired 11 retail properties and disposed of 24 retail properties and transferred two retail properties to their lenders in satisfaction of non-recourse debt. All dollar amounts shown in the following tables are stated in thousands unless otherwise noted.\nThe following table presents the changes in our income.\n\nLease income, net, consists of basic monthly rent, amortization of acquired above and below market leases, amortization of lease inducements, straight-line rent adjustments, percentage of sales rental income recorded pursuant to tenant leases, contractual reimbursements for real estate taxes, common area maintenance costs, tax and insurance costs, late charges, termination fee income, and estimated credit losses resulting from changes in the collectability of operating lease receivables.\nThe change in lease income, net, was a result of the following:\n \u2022 $40.4 million decrease from our dispositions, \n \u2022 $21.2 million increase from our acquisitions, and, \n \u2022 $3.3 million increase from our properties classified as same-property. \nThe following table presents the changes in our operating expenses.\n\nThe changes in our operating expenses were a result of the following:\n \u2022 $3.2 million decrease in depreciation and amortization, which was primarily a result of $5.8 million of accelerated depreciation at one property under re-development in 2018, \n \u2022 $7.1 million decrease in property operating expenses from our dispositions, \n \u2022 $3.4 million increase in property operating expenses from our acquisitions and $0.8 million increase in property operating expenses from our properties classified as same-property, \n \u2022 $4.9 million decrease in real estate taxes from our dispositions since January 1, 2018, and, \n \u2022 $2.9 million increase in real estate taxes from our acquisitions and $1.0 million increase in real estate taxes from our properties classified as same-property. \nThe following table presents the components of other income (expense). \nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net, consists of interest incurred on mortgages payable and our corporate credit facilities, interest incurred on other financing instruments, and amortization of loan fees.\nChanges in interest expense, net, were a result of the following:\n \u2022 $3.5 million decrease from our dispositions, \n \u2022 $0.7 million decrease from the surrender of two retail properties to the lenders in satisfaction of non-recourse debt in 2018, \n \u2022 $0.3 million decrease related to properties classified as same-property, and, \n \u2022 $2.3 million increase from a higher outstanding balance on our corporate term loan subsequent to December 31, 2018.  (Loss) gain on extinguishment of debt, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.9 million related to the loan pay-offs on two retail properties disposed of, comprising a $2.7 million prepayment penalty and $0.2 million of loan fee write-offs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt, net, of $9.1 million as a result of the following:\n \u2022 $10.8 million gain related to the surrender of Stonecrest Marketplace and a $1.7 million gain related to the surrender of Bellerive Plaza (both to their lenders in satisfaction of non-recourse debt), and, \n \u2022 $3.3 million loss related to the loan pay-offs on four retail properties at disposition as a result of $3.1 million in prepayment penalties.  Provision for asset impairment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we identified one retail property that had a reduction in its expected hold period. As a result, we recorded a provision for asset impairment of $2.4 million as the fair value (based on the agreed upon price) in the purchase contract being lower than the property's carrying value. This property was sold in 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we identified three retail properties that had reductions in their expected holding periods. As a result, we recorded an additional provision for asset impairment of:\n \u2022 $0.8 million on the disposal of one retail property in 2018, and \n \u2022 $2.7 million on two retail properties as a result of the fair value (the agreed upon price with the buyers) in the sales contracts being lower than the properties' carrying values during the year ended December 31, 2018. These properties were sold in 2018.  Gain on sale and transfer of investment properties, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a gain of $62.0 million on the sale of ten retail properties.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a gain on sale and transfer of investment properties, net, of $95.1 million as a result of the following:\n \u2022 $93.1 million net gain on the sale of 14 retail properties, \n \u2022 $1.8 million gain on transfer of assets, net, related to the surrender of Stonecrest Marketplace and Bellerive Plaza to the lender, and, \n \u2022 $0.2 million gain related to the completion of a partial condemnation at one retail property.  Equity in earnings (losses) and (impairment), net, of unconsolidated entities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized equity in earnings, net, of unconsolidated entities of $1.0 million as a result of net income from property operations within the IAGM joint venture.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized equity in earnings (losses) and (impairment), net, of unconsolidated entities of $31.4 million as a result of the following:\n \u2022 $29.9 million other-than-temporary impairment on DRV due to a reduction in the expected hold period of the joint venture, and, \n \u2022 $2.0 million equity in losses as a result of a net loss in property operations within the IAGM joint venture, including our $0.8 million share of a provision for asset impairment on three retail properties and our $0.3 million share of losses on the sale of two retail properties.  Net loss from discontinued operations\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $25.5 million relating to indemnity claims from the sale of our student housing business, which was sold in June 2016.\nNet Operating Income\nWe evaluate the performance of our wholly-owned and consolidated retail properties based on modified NOI. Modified NOI reflects income from operations excluding lease termination income and GAAP rent adjustments (such as straight-line rent, above/below market lease amortization and amortization of lease incentives). We believe modified NOI, same-property modified NOI, and modified NOI from other investment properties, each of which are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, provide added comparability across periods when evaluating the financial condition and operating performance that is not readily apparent from \"Operating income\" or \"Net income\" in accordance with GAAP.\nComparison of same-property results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nA total of 44 wholly-owned retail properties met our same-property criteria for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Modified NOI from other investment properties in the table below for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 includes retail properties that did not meet our same-property criteria. The following table represents the reconciliation of net income,\nthe most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Modified NOI and same-property modified NOI for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. \n (a) Adjustments to modified NOI include termination fee income and GAAP rent adjustments (such as straight-line rent, above/below market lease amortization and amortization of lease incentives). \n (b) Modified NOI from other investment properties for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 includes retail properties that did not meet our same-property criteria.  Comparison of the components of same-property modified NOI for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 \nSame-property modified NOI increased by $4.1 million, or 3.9%, when comparing the year ended December 31, 2019, to the same period in 2018. Approximately $3.0 million of this increase in modified NOI is attributed to base rent increases resulting from leasing previously unoccupied space and achieving more favorable rent terms with tenants. The remaining increase is the result of an increase in other property income of $0.7 million which was offset by an increase of $1.7 million in non-recoverable operating expenses. Included in the $4.1 million increase is $1.1 million related to the strategic acquisition of an adjacent portion of an existing shopping center that expanded GLA at a property classified as same-property.\nFunds From Operations\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), an industry trade group, has promulgated a standard known as Funds From Operations (\"FFO\"). Our FFO, based on the NAREIT definition, is net income (or loss) in accordance with GAAP excluding gains (or losses) resulting from dispositions of properties, plus depreciation and amortization and impairment charges on depreciable real property, after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures in which we hold an interest. We have adopted the NAREIT definition in our calculation of FFO Applicable to Common Shares because management considers FFO a widely accepted and appropriate non-GAAP measure of performance for REITs.\nIn calculating FFO, impairment charges of depreciable real estate assets are added back even though the impairment charge may represent a permanent decline in value due to the decreased operating performance of the applicable property. Furthermore, because gains and losses from sales of property are excluded from FFO, it is consistent and appropriate that impairments, which are often early recognition of losses on prospective sales of property, also be excluded. If evidence exists that a loss reflected in the investment of an unconsolidated entity is due to the impairment of depreciable real estate assets, our share of these impairments is added back to net income in the determination of FFO.\nModified Funds From Operations (\"Modified FFO\") is an additional financial measure we use because FFO includes certain non-comparable items that affect our performance over time. We define Modified FFO as FFO Applicable to Common Shares excluding the impact of discrete non-operating transactions and other events, which we do not deem representative of the comparable operating results of our multi-tenant retail platform.\nWe believe FFO Applicable to Common Shares provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of our financial performance that is not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe that Modified FFO extends that perspective and is helpful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future periods by excluding items that may cause short-term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on operating cash flows.\nFFO and Modified FFO are intended to be neither a substitute for \"net income\" nor a substitute for \"cash flows from operating activities\" as determined by GAAP. Other REITs may use alternative methodologies for calculating similarly titled measures, which may not be comparable to our calculation of FFO Applicable to Common Shares or Modified FFO Applicable to Common Shares.\nFFO Applicable to Common Shares and Modified FFO Applicable to Common Shares are calculated as follows: \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are required in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, evaluating the impairment of long-lived assets, allocating the purchase price of acquired retail properties, determining the fair value of debt and evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable. We base these estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nConsolidation\nWe evaluate our investments in LLCs and LPs to determine whether each such entity may be a VIE. The accounting standards related to the consolidation of VIEs require qualitative assessments to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. Determination of the primary beneficiary is based on whether we have (i) power to direct significant activities of the VIE and (ii) an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We consolidate a VIE if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The equity method of accounting is applied to entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary, or the entity is not a VIE and we do not have control, but can exercise influence over the entity with respect to its operations and major decisions. Our ability to correctly assess control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nLease Income\nFixed consideration, generally consisting of minimum lease payments, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of each lease. The cumulative difference between fixed consideration recognized on a straight-line basis and the cash payments due under the provisions of the lease agreements is recorded as deferred rent receivable and is included as a component of accounts and rents receivable on the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe commence revenue recognition on leases when the lessee takes possession of, or controls the physical use of, the leased asset, unless the lessee is constructing improvements for which we are deemed to be the owner for accounting purposes. If we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes, the leased asset is the finished space and revenue recognition commences when the lessee takes possession of it, typically when the improvements are substantially complete. Alternatively, if the lessee is deemed to be the owner of the improvements for accounting purposes, then the leased asset is the unimproved space, and any tenant improvement allowances funded under the lease are treated as lease incentives which reduce lease income recognized over the lease term, and we commence revenue recognition when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space.\nThe determination of who owns the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, is based on contractual rights and subject to judgment. In making that judgment, no one factor is determinative. We routinely consider:\n \u2022 whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent; \n \u2022 whether the tenant is required to provide evidence supporting the cost of improvements prior to reimbursement; \n \u2022 whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements; \n \u2022 the uniqueness of the improvements; \n \u2022 the expected economic life of the tenant improvements relative to the length of the lease; and \n \u2022 who constructs or directs the construction of the improvements.  Sale of Real Estate\nWe derecognize real estate and recognize a gain or loss when a contract exists and control of the property has transferred to the buyer. Control of the property, including controlling financial interest, is generally considered to transfer upon closing through transfer of the legal title and possession of the property, at which point we recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the transaction price and the carrying amount of the property.\nAcquisition of Real Estate\nWe evaluate the inputs, processes and outputs of each asset acquired to determine if the transaction is a business combination or asset acquisition. If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are generally capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets.\nWe allocate the purchase price of real estate to land, building, other building improvements, tenant improvements, intangible assets and liabilities (such as the value of above- and below-market leases, in-place leases and origination costs associated with in-place leases). The values of above- and below-market leases are recorded as intangible assets, net, and intangible liabilities, net, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets, and are amortized as either a decrease (in the case of above-market leases) or an increase (in the case of below-market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated tenant lease. The values, if any, associated with in-place leases are recorded in intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to depreciation and amortization expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income over the remaining lease term.\nThe difference between the contractual rental rates and our estimate of market rental rates is measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the leases plus the term of any below-market renewal options. For the amortization period, the remaining term of leases with renewal options at terms below market reflect the assumed exercise of such below-market renewal options, if reasonably assured.\nIf a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual expiration of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangible asset or liability is written off. Tenant improvements are depreciated and origination costs are amortized over the remaining term of the lease or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date.\nWe perform, with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, the following procedures for assets acquired:\n \u2022 Estimate the value of the property \"as if vacant\" as of the acquisition date; \n \u2022 Allocate the value of the property among land, building, and other building improvements and determine the associated useful life for each; \n \u2022 Calculate the value and associated life of above- and below-market leases on a tenant-by-tenant basis. The difference between the contractual rental rates and our estimate of market rental rates is measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the leases (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired, including geographical location, size of leased area, tenant profile and credit risk); \n \u2022 Estimate the fair value of the tenant improvements, legal costs and leasing commissions incurred to obtain the leases and calculate the associated useful life for each; \n \u2022 Estimate the fair value of assumed debt, if any; and \n \u2022 Estimate the intangible value of the in-place leases based on lease execution costs of similar leases as well as lost rent payments during an assumed lease-up period and their associated useful lives on a tenant-by-tenant basis.  Impairment of Long Lived Assets\nWe assess the carrying values of the long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable, such as a reduction in the expected holding period of the asset. If it is determined that the carrying value is not recoverable because the expected undiscounted cash flows do not exceed that carrying value, we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. The valuation and possible subsequent impairment of investment properties is a significant estimate that can and does change based on our continuous process of analyzing each property's economic condition at a point in time and reviewing assumptions about uncertain inherent factors, including observable inputs such as contractual revenues and unobservable inputs such as forecasted revenues and expenses, estimated net disposition proceeds, and discount rate. These unobservable inputs are based on market conditions and our expected growth rates.\nHowever, assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions and in our ultimate investment intent that occur subsequent to the impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in additional impairment of the investment properties.\nPeriodically, we assesses whether there are any indicators that the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated entities may be other-than-temporarily impaired. To the extent other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. The estimated fair value of the investment is generally derived from the cash flows generated from the investee's underlying real property investments.\nReal Estate Capitalization and Depreciation\nReal estate is reflected at cost less accumulated depreciation within investment property on the consolidated balance sheets. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nDepreciation expense is computed using the straight line method. Buildings are depreciated based upon an estimated useful life of 30 years, and 5-15 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment and site improvements. Finance lease assets are generally amortized using the straight-line method over the lease term. Finance lease asset amortization is included in depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nTenant improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the life of the tenant improvement or the lease term and is included in depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nDirect and indirect costs that are clearly related to the construction and improvements of investment properties are capitalized. Costs incurred for property taxes and insurance are capitalized during periods in which activities necessary to prepare the property for its intended use are in progress. Interest costs are also capitalized during such periods.\nIncome Taxes\nWe qualify and have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for federal income tax purposes commencing with the tax year ended December 31, 2005. Since we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that is distributed to stockholders. A REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to its stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, without the benefit of certain relief provisions, we will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income, property or net worth and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. We have elected to treat certain of our consolidated subsidiaries, and may in the future elect to treat newly formed subsidiaries, as TRSs pursuant to the Code. Among other activities, TRSs may participate in non-real estate related activities and/or perform non-customary services for tenants and are subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate tax rates.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDevelopment, Re-development, Capital Expenditures and Leasing Activities\nThe following table summarizes capital resources used through development and re-development, capital expenditures and leasing activities at the Company's retail properties owned during the year ended December 31, 2019. These costs are classified as cash used in capital expenditures and tenant improvements on the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019. \n (a) Direct development and re-development costs relate to construction of buildings at our retail properties. \n (b) Indirect development and re-development costs relate to the capitalized interest, real estate taxes, insurance and payroll attributed to improvements at our retail properties. \n (c) Direct leasing costs relate to improvements to a tenant space that are either paid directly by or reimbursed to the tenants. \nShort-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOn a short-term basis, our principal demands for funds are to pay our operating, corporate, and transaction readiness expenses, as well as property capital expenditures, to make distributions to our stockholders, and to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements from cash flows from operations, distributions from our joint venture investment, sales of our retail properties and available capacity on our revolving credit agreements.\nLong-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur objectives are to maximize revenue generated by our multi-tenant retail platform, to further enhance the value of our retail properties to produce attractive current yield and long-term returns for our stockholders, and to generate sustainable and predictable cash flow from our operations to distribute to our stockholders. We are seeking to increase our operating cash flows over time through the execution of our strategy.\nOur Board approved an increase to our annual distribution rate effective for the quarterly distribution paid in April 2019. As we execute our retail strategy, the Board has evaluated and will continue to evaluate our distribution rate and, if the Board deems appropriate, adjust the rate to take into account our progress in refining and balancing our multi-tenant retail platform. See \"Part I, Item 1A.Risk Factors - There is no assurance that we will be able to continue paying cash distributions or that distributions will increase over time.\"\nOur primary sources and uses of capital are as follows:\nSources\n \u2022 Operating cash flows from our real estate investments, which consists of our retail properties; \n \u2022 Distributions from our joint venture investment; \n \u2022 Proceeds from sales of properties; \n \u2022 Proceeds from mortgage loan borrowings on properties; \n \u2022 Proceeds from corporate borrowings; and \n \u2022 Proceeds from interest earned on cash and cash equivalents.  Uses\n \u2022 To pay our operating expenses; \n \u2022 To make distributions to our stockholders; \n \u2022 To service or pay down our debt; \n \u2022 To invest in properties and portfolios of properties; \n \u2022 To fund development, re-development, maintenance and capital expenditures or leasing investments; and \n \u2022 To repurchase our common stock.  We may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase additional amounts of our outstanding equity through cash purchases or exchanges for other securities. Such purchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nSummary of Cash Flows \nCash provided by operating activities of $106.0 million and $124.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was generated primarily from income from property operations and operating distributions from unconsolidated entities. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $18.6 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2019, to the same period in 2018 primarily as a result of general fluctuations in working capital and the disposition of 24 retail\nproperties and transfer of two retail properties since January 1, 2018, which was partially offset by the acquisition of ten retail properties since January 1, 2018.\nCash used in investing activities of $41.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily the result of:\n \u2022 $359.1 million for acquisitions of investment properties, \n \u2022 $17.8 million for capital expenditures and tenant improvements, \n \u2022 $7.1 million for investment in development projects, \n \u2022 $5.6 million for lease commissions and other leasing costs, \n \u2022 $30.0 million to settle the UHC claims as described in \"Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies\" of the consolidated financial statements, partially offset by cash provided of \n \u2022 $346.7 million from net proceeds received from the sale of investment properties, \n \u2022 $30.0 million received from the sale of an unconsolidated entity, and, \n \u2022 $1.1 million from cash inflows from other investing activities.  Cash provided by investing activities of $175.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily the result of:\n \u2022 $430.5 million from net proceeds received from the sale of investment properties, \n \u2022 $2.7 million received from net cash inflows from other investing activities, partially offset by cash used of \n \u2022 $220.8 million for acquisitions of investment properties, \n \u2022 $27.2 million for capital expenditures and tenant improvements, \n \u2022 $3.8 million for investment in development projects, and \n \u2022 $6.0 million for lease commissions and other leasing costs.  Cash used in financing activities of $68.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily the result of:\n \u2022 $111.0 million for pay-offs of debt, debt prepayment penalties, principal payments of mortgage debt, and payment of loan fees and other deposits, \n \u2022 $20.4 million for the repurchase of common stock under our share repurchase plan, \n \u2022 $53.3 million to pay distributions, \n \u2022 $1.4 million for the payment of tax withholding for share-based compensation, \n \u2022 $0.2 million for the payment of finance lease liabilities, partially offset by cash provided of \n \u2022 $118.0 million from proceeds received from debt related to the Term Loan Agreement.  Cash used in financing activities of $207.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily the result of:\n \u2022 $231.9 million for pay-offs of debt, debt prepayment penalties, principal payments of mortgage debt, and payment of loan fees and other deposits, \n \u2022 $98.4 million for the 2018 Offer, \n \u2022 $54.2 million to pay distributions, \n \u2022 $1.6 million for the payment of tax withholding for share-based compensation, \n \u2022 $0.3 million for the payment of finance lease liabilities, partially offset by cash provided of \n \u2022 $179.3 million from proceeds from debt related to the Term Loan Agreement.  We consider all demand deposits, money market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements with a maturity of three months or less, at the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents at major financial institutions. The combined account balances at one or more institutions generally exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") insurance coverage. The Company periodically assesses the credit risk associated with these financial institutions. As a result, there is what we believe to be insignificant credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions of Real Estate Investments\nIn 2019, we acquired seven retail properties and a building and two retail parcels adjacent to three existing retail properties. In 2018, we acquired three retail properties, including one retail property classified as a consolidated VIE, and the acquisition of two retail parcels adjacent to two existing retail properties. These acquisitions were funded with available cash, disposition\nproceeds, and mortgage indebtedness. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we invested net cash of approximately $359.1 million and $220.8 million, respectively, for these acquisitions.\nIn 2019, we disposed of ten retail properties. In 2018, we disposed of 16 retail properties, including the surrender of two properties to their respective lenders in satisfaction of non-recourse debt, and completed a partial condemnation at one retail property for an aggregate gross disposition price of $466.2 million.\nDistributions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we declared cash distributions to our stockholders totaling $53.5 million and paid cash distributions of $53.3 million.\nAs we execute on our retail strategy, the Board evaluated and expects to continue to evaluate our distribution rate on a periodic basis. See \"Part I. Item 1. Business - Current Strategy and Outlook\" for more information regarding our retail strategy. The following table presents a historical summary of distributions declared, paid and reinvested. \nShare Repurchase Program\nOn November 1, 2019, we adopted the Share Repurchase Program, authorizing redemption of the Company's shares of common stock, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to provide limited liquidity to qualifying stockholders. Our obligation to repurchase any shares under the Share Repurchase Program was conditioned upon our having sufficient funds available to complete the repurchase. The repurchase price per share for all stockholders is equal to a 25% discount to the most recent estimated NAV per share of our common stock established by our Board, which was $3.14 per share as of May 1, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 8,517,605 shares were repurchased in connection with the Share Repurchase Program. The price per share for all shares repurchased was $2.355.\nAmended and Restated Distribution Reinvestment Plan\nOn November 1, 2019, we began offering shares of our common stock to our existing stockholders pursuant to the DRP. Under the DRP, stockholders may elect to reinvest an amount equal to the distributions declared on their shares of common stock into additional shares of our common stock in lieu of receiving cash distributions. In accordance with the DRP, participants may acquire shares of common stock at a 25% discount to the most recent estimated NAV per share of our common stock established by our Board, which was $3.14 per share as of May 1, 2019. In connection with the DRP, in", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis relates to the operations of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and its financial position as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Discussion of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Annual Report can be found in \"Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report.\nExecutive Summary\nInvenTrust Properties Corp. is a premier multi-tenant retail REIT that owns, leases, redevelops, acquires and manages grocery-anchored neighborhood centers, and select power centers that often have a grocery component, in Sun Belt markets with favorable demographics. We seek to continue to execute our strategy to enhance our multi-tenant retail platform by further investing in grocery-anchored centers with essential retail in our current markets, while exhibiting focused and disciplined capital allocation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we continued to execute on our strategy by opportunistically disposing of properties not located in our identified markets or where we believe the properties' values have been maximized. Our strategy is to redeploy the proceeds from these sales with a disciplined approach into strategic retail properties in our target markets. However, we face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities. As a result of this competition, the purchase prices for attractive and suitable assets may be significantly elevated and may adversely impact our ability to redeploy the proceeds from property sales for reinvestment. In addition, our disposition activity could continue to cause us to experience dilution in financial operating performance during the period in which we dispose of properties.\nIn evaluating our financial condition and operating performance, management focuses on the following financial and non-financial indicators, discussed in further detail herein:\n \u2022 Property net operating income (\"NOI\"), which excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, provision for asset impairment, interest, dividend and other income, gains (losses) from sales of properties, gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt, interest expense, net, equity in earnings (losses) and (impairment), net, from unconsolidated entities, and realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities, net; \n \u2022 Modified NOI, a supplemental measure not determined in accordance with GAAP, which reflects property NOI exclusive of lease termination income and GAAP rent adjustments (such as straight-line rent, above/below market lease amortization and amortization of lease incentives); \n \u2022 FFO Applicable to Common Shares, a supplemental non-GAAP measure; \n \u2022 Modified FFO Applicable to Common Shares, a supplemental non-GAAP measure; \n \u2022 Cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP; \n \u2022 Economic and physical occupancy and rental rates; \n \u2022 Leasing activity and lease rollover; \n \u2022 Management of operating expenses; \n \u2022 Management of general and administrative expenses; \n \u2022 Debt maturities and leverage ratios; and \n \u2022 Liquidity levels. \nOur Multi-Tenant Retail Portfolio\nOur wholly-owned, consolidated and managed retail properties include grocery-anchored community and neighborhood centers and power centers, including those classified as necessity-based. As of December 31, 2019, we owned 65 retail properties with a GLA of approximately 10.9 million square feet, which includes 11 retail properties with a GLA of approximately 2.6 million square feet owned through the Company's ownership interest in an unconsolidated joint venture, IAGM.

2019\nLiquidation of Joint Venture Interest\nOn June 24, 2019, we liquidated all interests in Downtown Railyard Venture, LLC (\"DRV\"), a joint venture established for the purpose of developing and selling a land development in Sacramento, California, in exchange for $30.0 million of cash consideration. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $29.9 million on DRV due to a reduction in the expected hold period, thereby reducing the investment to an estimated fair value that we believed would be most probable of realization if the investment was liquidated. As a result of the other-than-temporary impairment, the liquidation of interests resulted in no gain or loss being recognized on the transaction during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nUniversity House Communities Group, Inc., Indemnity Claims\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized additional losses, within discontinued operations, of $25.5 million as a result of the final settlement related to indemnity claims between UHC Acquisition Sub LLC (\"UHC\") and the Company.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn November 1, 2019, we adopted the Share Repurchase Program, authorizing redemption of the Company's shares of common stock, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to provide limited liquidity to qualifying stockholders. Our obligation to repurchase any shares under the Share Repurchase Program was conditioned upon our having sufficient funds available to complete the repurchase. The repurchase price per share for all stockholders is equal to a 25% discount to the most recent estimated NAV per share of our common stock established by our Board, which was $3.14 per share as of May 1, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 8,517,605 shares were repurchased in connection with the Program. The price per share for all shares repurchased was $2.355 for aggregate consideration of $20.1 million.\nAmended and Restated Distribution Reinvestment Plan\nOn November 1, 2019, we began offering shares of our common stock to our existing stockholders pursuant to the DRP. Under the DRP, stockholders may elect to reinvest an amount equal to the distributions declared on their shares of common stock into additional shares of our common stock in lieu of receiving cash distributions. In accordance with the DRP, participants may acquire shares of common stock at a 25% discount to the most recent estimated NAV per share of our common stock established by our Board, which was $3.14 per share as of May 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the DRP purchase price was $2.355 per share. In connection with the DRP, in January 2020, we sold a total of 21,249 shares and generated $0.05 million in gross offering proceeds under the DRP.\nDistribution rate\nOn November 11, 2019, our Board approved an increase to our annual distribution rate effective for the quarterly distribution payable in April 2020, from $0.0737 to $0.0759 per share annualized.\nRecent Activities\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we have evaluated events and transactions occurring after December 31, 2019, through the date the financial statements were issued for recognition and disclosure purposes.\nCurrent Strategy and Outlook\nInvenTrust focuses on grocery-anchored neighborhood centers, and select power centers that often have a grocery component, in markets with favorable demographics, including above average growth in population, employment and income. We believe these conditions create favorable demand characteristics for grocery-anchored and necessity-based retail centers which will enable us to capitalize on potential future rent increases while enjoying sustained occupancy at our centers. Using these criteria, we have identified 15 to 20 markets within the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Houston, the greater Los Angeles and San Diego areas, Miami, Orlando, Raleigh-Durham, San Antonio and Tampa.\nWe have a coordinated program to increase rental income by maximizing existing re-development opportunities and identifying locations in our current multi-tenant retail platform where we can increase the overall square footage of the property. In addition, we work with our tenants to expand rentable square footage at select retail properties where demand warrants additional supply. In addition, due to our properties as both retail centers and community focal points, we are able to identify short-term and specialty leasing opportunities that generate revenue from areas of the properties which are typically vacant.\nOur grocery-anchored neighborhood centers bring consumers to our well-located properties, while our larger-format necessity-based power center retailers continue to adapt their business models to embrace omni-channel retail and appeal to consumers' continuing focus on value. Our property management team is focused on enhancing the consumer shopping experience at our centers by maintaining strong tenant relationships, controlling expenses, and investing in sustainability programs at a number of our retail properties with initiatives such as LED lighting, trash recycling, water conservation and other programs to reduce energy consumption and expenses.\nIn addition, our leasing staff continues to focus on leasing space at our retail properties at favorable rental rates while establishing a more favorable tenant mix and identifying complementary uses to maximize tenant performance. We believe our strong locations have allowed and will continue to allow us to backfill the vacancies created by such tenants.\nWe believe the refinement of our multi-tenant retail platform has positioned us for future success and will allow us to evaluate and ultimately execute on a potential strategic transaction, achieve liquidity for and provide a return of capital to our stockholders in the long term. While we believe in our ability to execute on our plan, the timing is uncertain and may be shortened or extended by external and macroeconomic factors including, among others, interest rate movements, local, regional, national and global economic performance, competitive factors, the impact of e-commerce on the retail industry, future retailer store closings, retailer consolidation, retailers reducing store size, retailer bankruptcies, and government policy changes.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following section describes and compares our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

(Loss) gain on extinguishment of debt, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.9 million related to the loan pay-offs on two retail properties disposed of, comprising a $2.7 million prepayment penalty and $0.2 million of loan fee write-offs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt, net, of $9.1 million as a result of the following:\n \u2022 $10.8 million gain related to the surrender of Stonecrest Marketplace and a $1.7 million gain related to the surrender of Bellerive Plaza (both to their lenders in satisfaction of non-recourse debt), and, \n \u2022 $3.3 million loss related to the loan pay-offs on four retail properties at disposition as a result of $3.1 million in prepayment penalties.  Provision for asset impairment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we identified one retail property that had a reduction in its expected hold period. As a result, we recorded a provision for asset impairment of $2.4 million as the fair value (based on the agreed upon price) in the purchase contract being lower than the property's carrying value. This property was sold in 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we identified three retail properties that had reductions in their expected holding periods. As a result, we recorded an additional provision for asset impairment of:\n \u2022 $0.8 million on the disposal of one retail property in 2018, and \n \u2022 $2.7 million on two retail properties as a result of the fair value (the agreed upon price with the buyers) in the sales contracts being lower than the properties' carrying values during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Equity in earnings (losses) and (impairment), net, of unconsolidated entities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized equity in earnings, net, of unconsolidated entities of $1.0 million as a result of net income from property operations within the IAGM joint venture.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized equity in earnings (losses) and (impairment), net, of unconsolidated entities of $31.4 million as a result of the following:\n \u2022 $29.9 million other-than-temporary impairment on DRV due to a reduction in the expected hold period of the joint venture, and, \n \u2022 $2.0 million equity in losses as a result of a net loss in property operations within the IAGM joint venture, including our $0.8 million share of a provision for asset impairment on three retail properties and our $0.3 million share of losses on the sale of two retail properties.  Net loss from discontinued operations\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $25.5 million relating to indemnity claims from the sale of our student housing business, which was sold in June 2016.\nNet Operating Income\nWe evaluate the performance of our wholly-owned and consolidated retail properties based on modified NOI. Modified NOI reflects income from operations excluding lease termination income and GAAP rent adjustments (such as straight-line rent, above/below market lease amortization and amortization of lease incentives). We believe modified NOI, same-property modified NOI, and modified NOI from other investment properties, each of which are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, provide added comparability across periods when evaluating the financial condition and operating performance that is not readily apparent from \"Operating income\" or \"Net income\" in accordance with GAAP.\nComparison of same-property results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nA total of 44 wholly-owned retail properties met our same-property criteria for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Modified NOI from other investment properties in the table below for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 includes retail properties that did not meet our same-property criteria.

Approximately $3.0 million of this increase in modified NOI is attributed to base rent increases resulting from leasing previously unoccupied space and achieving more favorable rent terms with tenants. The remaining increase is the result of an increase in other property income of $0.7 million which was offset by an increase of $1.7 million in non-recoverable operating expenses. Included in the $4.1 million increase is $1.1 million related to the strategic acquisition of an adjacent portion of an existing shopping center that expanded GLA at a property classified as same-property.\nFunds From Operations\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), an industry trade group, has promulgated a standard known as Funds From Operations (\"FFO\"). Our FFO, based on the NAREIT definition, is net income (or loss) in accordance with GAAP excluding gains (or losses) resulting from dispositions of properties, plus depreciation and amortization and impairment charges on depreciable real property, after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures in which we hold an interest. We have adopted the NAREIT definition in our calculation of FFO Applicable to Common Shares because management considers FFO a widely accepted and appropriate non-GAAP measure of performance for REITs.\nIn calculating FFO, impairment charges of depreciable real estate assets are added back even though the impairment charge may represent a permanent decline in value due to the decreased operating performance of the applicable property. Furthermore, because gains and losses from sales of property are excluded from FFO, it is consistent and appropriate that impairments, which are often early recognition of losses on prospective sales of property, also be excluded. If evidence exists that a loss reflected in the investment of an unconsolidated entity is due to the impairment of depreciable real estate assets, our share of these impairments is added back to net income in the determination of FFO.\nModified Funds From Operations (\"Modified FFO\") is an additional financial measure we use because FFO includes certain non-comparable items that affect our performance over time. We define Modified FFO as FFO Applicable to Common Shares excluding the impact of discrete non-operating transactions and other events, which we do not deem representative of the comparable operating results of our multi-tenant retail platform.\nWe believe FFO Applicable to Common Shares provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of our financial performance that is not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe that Modified FFO extends that perspective and is helpful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future periods by excluding items that may cause short-term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on operating cash flows.\nFFO and Modified FFO are intended to be neither a substitute for \"net income\" nor a substitute for \"cash flows from operating activities\" as determined by GAAP. Other REITs may use alternative methodologies for calculating similarly titled measures, which may not be comparable to our calculation of FFO Applicable to Common Shares or Modified FFO Applicable to Common Shares.\nFFO Applicable to Common Shares and Modified FFO Applicable to Common Shares are calculated as follows: Table 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization related to investment properties\n</td> <td>94,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Our share of depreciation and amortization recognized in equity in earnings (losses) and (impairment), net, of unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>11,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for asset impairment\n</td> <td>2,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Our share of provision for asset impairment recognized in equity in earnings (losses) and (impairment), net, of unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale and transfer of investment properties, net\n</td> <td>(62,011\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95,097\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Our share of losses from property dispositions recognized in equity in earnings (losses) and (impairment), net, of unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO Applicable to Common Shares\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(244\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, net\n</td> <td>2,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of mark to market debt, premium, and discount, net\n</td> <td>(202\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(202\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of above and below-market leases and lease inducements, net\n</td> <td>(6,148\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,347\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization of corporate assets\n</td> <td>3,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight-line rent adjustment, net\n</td> <td>(3,464\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,262\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Our share of straight-line rent adjustment, net, recognized in equity in earnings (losses) and (impairment), net, of unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(538\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation, net\n</td> <td>5,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for indemnification claims in discontinued operations\n</td> <td>25,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Modified FFO Applicable to Common Shares\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are required in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, evaluating the impairment of long-lived assets, allocating the purchase price of acquired retail properties, determining the fair value of debt and evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable. We base these estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nConsolidation\nWe evaluate our investments in LLCs and LPs to determine whether each such entity may be a VIE. The accounting standards related to the consolidation of VIEs require qualitative assessments to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. Determination of the primary beneficiary is based on whether we have (i) power to direct significant activities of the VIE and (ii) an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We consolidate a VIE if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The equity method of accounting is applied to entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary, or the entity is not a VIE and we do not have control, but can exercise influence over the entity with respect to its operations and major decisions. Our ability to correctly assess control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nLease Income\nFixed consideration, generally consisting of minimum lease payments, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of each lease. The cumulative difference between fixed consideration recognized on a straight-line basis and the cash payments due under the provisions of the lease agreements is recorded as deferred rent receivable and is included as a component of accounts and rents receivable on the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe commence revenue recognition on leases when the lessee takes possession of, or controls the physical use of, the leased asset, unless the lessee is constructing improvements for which we are deemed to be the owner for accounting purposes. If we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes, the leased asset is the finished space and revenue recognition commences when the lessee takes possession of it, typically when the improvements are substantially complete. Alternatively, if the lessee is deemed to be the owner of the improvements for accounting purposes, then the leased asset is the unimproved space, and any tenant improvement allowances funded under the lease are treated as lease incentives which reduce lease income recognized over the lease term, and we commence revenue recognition when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space.\nThe determination of who owns the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, is based on contractual rights and subject to judgment. In making that judgment, no one factor is determinative. We routinely consider:\n \u2022 whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent; \n \u2022 whether the tenant is required to provide evidence supporting the cost of improvements prior to reimbursement; \n \u2022 whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements; \n \u2022 the uniqueness of the improvements; \n \u2022 the expected economic life of the tenant improvements relative to the length of the lease; and \n \u2022 who constructs or directs the construction of the improvements.  Sale of Real Estate\nWe derecognize real estate and recognize a gain or loss when a contract exists and control of the property has transferred to the buyer. Control of the property, including controlling financial interest, is generally considered to transfer upon closing through transfer of the legal title and possession of the property, at which point we recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the transaction price and the carrying amount of the property.\nAcquisition of Real Estate\nWe evaluate the inputs, processes and outputs of each asset acquired to determine if the transaction is a business combination or asset acquisition. If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are generally capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets.\nWe allocate the purchase price of real estate to land, building, other building improvements, tenant improvements, intangible assets and liabilities (such as the value of above- and below-market leases, in-place leases and origination costs associated with in-place leases). The values of above- and below-market leases are recorded as intangible assets, net, and intangible liabilities, net, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets, and are amortized as either a decrease (in the case of above-market leases) or an increase (in the case of below-market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated tenant lease. The values, if any, associated with in-place leases are recorded in intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to depreciation and amortization expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income over the remaining lease term.\nThe difference between the contractual rental rates and our estimate of market rental rates is measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the leases plus the term of any below-market renewal options. For the amortization period, the remaining term of leases with renewal options at terms below market reflect the assumed exercise of such below-market renewal options, if reasonably assured.\nIf a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual expiration of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangible asset or liability is written off. Tenant improvements are depreciated and origination costs are amortized over the remaining term of the lease or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date.\nWe perform, with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, the following procedures for assets acquired:\n \u2022 Estimate the value of the property \"as if vacant\" as of the acquisition date; \n \u2022 Allocate the value of the property among land, building, and other building improvements and determine the associated useful life for each; \n \u2022 Calculate the value and associated life of above- and below-market leases on a tenant-by-tenant basis. The difference between the contractual rental rates and our estimate of market rental rates is measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the leases (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired, including geographical location, size of leased area, tenant profile and credit risk); \n \u2022 Estimate the fair value of the tenant improvements, legal costs and leasing commissions incurred to obtain the leases and calculate the associated useful life for each; \n \u2022 Estimate the fair value of assumed debt, if any; and \n \u2022 Estimate the intangible value of the in-place leases based on lease execution costs of similar leases as well as lost rent payments during an assumed lease-up period and their associated useful lives on a tenant-by-tenant basis.  Impairment of Long Lived Assets\nWe assess the carrying values of the long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable, such as a reduction in the expected holding period of the asset. If it is determined that the carrying value is not recoverable because the expected undiscounted cash flows do not exceed that carrying value, we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. The valuation and possible subsequent impairment of investment properties is a significant estimate that can and does change based on our continuous process of analyzing each property's economic condition at a point in time and reviewing assumptions about uncertain inherent factors, including observable inputs such as contractual revenues and unobservable inputs such as forecasted revenues and expenses, estimated net disposition proceeds, and discount rate. These unobservable inputs are based on market conditions and our expected growth rates.\nHowever, assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions and in our ultimate investment intent that occur subsequent to the impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in additional impairment of the investment properties.\nPeriodically, we assesses whether there are any indicators that the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated entities may be other-than-temporarily impaired. To the extent other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. The estimated fair value of the investment is generally derived from the cash flows generated from the investee's underlying real property investments.\nReal Estate Capitalization and Depreciation\nReal estate is reflected at cost less accumulated depreciation within investment property on the consolidated balance sheets. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nDepreciation expense is computed using the straight line method. Buildings are depreciated based upon an estimated useful life of 30 years, and 5-15 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment and site improvements. Finance lease assets are generally amortized using the straight-line method over the lease term. Finance lease asset amortization is included in depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nTenant improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the life of the tenant improvement or the lease term and is included in depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nDirect and indirect costs that are clearly related to the construction and improvements of investment properties are capitalized. Costs incurred for property taxes and insurance are capitalized during periods in which activities necessary to prepare the property for its intended use are in progress. Interest costs are also capitalized during such periods.\nIncome Taxes\nWe qualify and have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for federal income tax purposes commencing with the tax year ended December 31, 2005. Since we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that is distributed to stockholders. A REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to its stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, without the benefit of certain relief provisions, we will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income, property or net worth and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. We have elected to treat certain of our consolidated subsidiaries, and may in the future elect to treat newly formed subsidiaries, as TRSs pursuant to the Code. Among other activities, TRSs may participate in non-real estate related activities and/or perform non-customary services for tenants and are subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate tax rates.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDevelopment, Re-development, Capital Expenditures and Leasing Activities\nThe following table summarizes capital resources used through development and re-development, capital expenditures and leasing activities at the Company's retail properties owned during the year ended December 31, 2019. These costs are classified as cash used in capital expenditures and tenant improvements on the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements from cash flows from operations, distributions from our joint venture investment, sales of our retail properties and available capacity on our revolving credit agreements.\nLong-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur objectives are to maximize revenue generated by our multi-tenant retail platform, to further enhance the value of our retail properties to produce attractive current yield and long-term returns for our stockholders, and to generate sustainable and predictable cash flow from our operations to distribute to our stockholders. We are seeking to increase our operating cash flows over time through the execution of our strategy.\nOur Board approved an increase to our annual distribution rate effective for the quarterly distribution paid in April 2019. As we execute our retail strategy, the Board has evaluated and will continue to evaluate our distribution rate and, if the Board deems appropriate, adjust the rate to take into account our progress in refining and balancing our multi-tenant retail platform. See \"Part I, Item 1A.Risk Factors - There is no assurance that we will be able to continue paying cash distributions or that distributions will increase over time.\"\nOur primary sources and uses of capital are as follows:\nSources\n \u2022 Operating cash flows from our real estate investments, which consists of our retail properties; \n \u2022 Distributions from our joint venture investment; \n \u2022 Proceeds from sales of properties; \n \u2022 Proceeds from mortgage loan borrowings on properties; \n \u2022 Proceeds from corporate borrowings; and \n \u2022 Proceeds from interest earned on cash and cash equivalents.  Uses\n \u2022 To pay our operating expenses; \n \u2022 To make distributions to our stockholders; \n \u2022 To service or pay down our debt; \n \u2022 To invest in properties and portfolios of properties; \n \u2022 To fund development, re-development, maintenance and capital expenditures or leasing investments; and \n \u2022 To repurchase our common stock.  We may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase additional amounts of our outstanding equity through cash purchases or exchanges for other securities. Such purchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nSummary of Cash Flows Table 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,649\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>(41,797\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(217,211\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(68,316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(207,096\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(4,105\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(97,080\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at beginning of year\n</td> <td>264,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>264,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,105\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash provided by operating activities of $106.0 million and $124.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was generated primarily from income from property operations and operating distributions from unconsolidated entities. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $18.6 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2019, to the same period in 2018 primarily as a result of general fluctuations in working capital and the disposition of 24 retail\nproperties and transfer of two retail properties since January 1, 2018, which was partially offset by the acquisition of ten retail properties since January 1, 2018.\nCash used in investing activities of $41.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily the result of:\n \u2022 $359.1 million for acquisitions of investment properties, \n \u2022 $17.8 million for capital expenditures and tenant improvements, \n \u2022 $7.1 million for investment in development projects, \n \u2022 $5.6 million for lease commissions and other leasing costs, \n \u2022 $30.0 million to settle the UHC claims as described in \"Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies\" of the consolidated financial statements, partially offset by cash provided of \n \u2022 $346.7 million from net proceeds received from the sale of investment properties, \n \u2022 $30.0 million received from the sale of an unconsolidated entity, and, \n \u2022 $1.1 million from cash inflows from other investing activities.  Cash provided by investing activities of $175.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily the result of:\n \u2022 $430.5 million from net proceeds received from the sale of investment properties, \n \u2022 $2.7 million received from net cash inflows from other investing activities, partially offset by cash used of \n \u2022 $220.8 million for acquisitions of investment properties, \n \u2022 $27.2 million for capital expenditures and tenant improvements, \n \u2022 $3.8 million for investment in development projects, and \n \u2022 $6.0 million for lease commissions and other leasing costs.  Cash used in financing activities of $68.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily the result of:\n \u2022 $111.0 million for pay-offs of debt, debt prepayment penalties, principal payments of mortgage debt, and payment of loan fees and other deposits, \n \u2022 $20.4 million for the repurchase of common stock under our share repurchase plan, \n \u2022 $53.3 million to pay distributions, \n \u2022 $1.4 million for the payment of tax withholding for share-based compensation, \n \u2022 $0.2 million for the payment of finance lease liabilities, partially offset by cash provided of \n \u2022 $118.0 million from proceeds received from debt related to the Term Loan Agreement.  Cash used in financing activities of $207.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily the result of:\n \u2022 $231.9 million for pay-offs of debt, debt prepayment penalties, principal payments of mortgage debt, and payment of loan fees and other deposits, \n \u2022 $98.4 million for the 2018 Offer, \n \u2022 $54.2 million to pay distributions, \n \u2022 $1.6 million for the payment of tax withholding for share-based compensation, \n \u2022 $0.3 million for the payment of finance lease liabilities, partially offset by cash provided of \n \u2022 $179.3 million from proceeds from debt related to the Term Loan Agreement.  We consider all demand deposits, money market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements with a maturity of three months or less, at the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents at major financial institutions. The combined account balances at one or more institutions generally exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") insurance coverage. The Company periodically assesses the credit risk associated with these financial institutions. As a result, there is what we believe to be insignificant credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions of Real Estate Investments\nIn 2019, we acquired seven retail properties and a building and two retail parcels adjacent to three existing retail properties. In 2018, we acquired three retail properties, including one retail property classified as a consolidated VIE, and the acquisition of two retail parcels adjacent to two existing retail properties. These acquisitions were funded with available cash, disposition\nproceeds, and mortgage indebtedness. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we invested net cash of approximately $359.1 million and $220.8 million, respectively, for these acquisitions.\nIn 2019, we disposed of ten retail properties. In 2018, we disposed of 16 retail properties, including the surrender of two properties to their respective lenders in satisfaction of non-recourse debt, and completed a partial condemnation at one retail property for an aggregate gross disposition price of $466.2 million.\nDistributions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we declared cash distributions to our stockholders totaling $53.5 million and paid cash distributions of $53.3 million.\nAs we execute on our retail strategy, the Board evaluated and expects to continue to evaluate our distribution rate on a periodic basis. See \"Part I. Item 1. Business - Current Strategy and Outlook\" for more information regarding our retail strategy. The following table presents a historical summary of distributions declared, paid and reinvested.

Our obligation to repurchase any shares under the Share Repurchase Program was conditioned upon our having sufficient funds available to complete the repurchase. The repurchase price per share for all stockholders is equal to a 25% discount to the most recent estimated NAV per share of our common stock established by our Board, which was $3.14 per share as of May 1, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 8,517,605 shares were repurchased in connection with the Share Repurchase Program. The price per share for all shares repurchased was $2.355.\nAmended and Restated Distribution Reinvestment Plan\nOn November 1, 2019, we began offering shares of our common stock to our existing stockholders pursuant to the DRP. Under the DRP, stockholders may elect to reinvest an amount equal to the distributions declared on their shares of common stock into additional shares of our common stock in lieu of receiving cash distributions. In accordance with the DRP, participants may acquire shares of common stock at a 25% discount to the most recent estimated NAV per share of our common stock established by our Board, which was $3.14 per share as of May 1, 2019.
