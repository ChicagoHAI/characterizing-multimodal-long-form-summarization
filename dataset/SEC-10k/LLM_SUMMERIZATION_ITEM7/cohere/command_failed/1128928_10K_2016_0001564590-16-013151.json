The following information contains forward-looking statements which involve certain risks and uncertainties. See Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this Form 10-K.\nOverview:\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is segregated into four sections, including:\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Business - discussion of our long-term strategic objectives, acquisitions, and the competitive environment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Critical accounting estimates - describes the accounting areas where management makes critical estimates to report our financial condition and results of operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Results of operations - an analysis of the company's consolidated results of operations for the two comparative periods presented in our consolidated financial statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Liquidity and capital resources - an analysis of cash flow, contractual obligations, and certain other matters affecting the company's financial position.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere were several significant events that will provide additional context while reading this discussion. Fiscal 2014 was a 53 week year while fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2013 were 52 week years. These events include:\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Further expansion into the organic bread market - As discussed below, we have recently completed two strategic acquisitions, Dave's Killer Bread and Alpine Valley Bread Company, which we believe strengthen our position in the fast growing organic bread market.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Alpine Valley Bread Company acquisition - On October 13, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Alpine Valley Bread Company ( Alpine\u201d), a family-owned producer of certified organic and all-natural breads in the U.S., for approximately $121.9 million in cash and stock. Alpine has two production facilities in Mesa, Arizona and is included in our Warehouse Segment. The acquisition expands our penetration into the organic market and provides additional organic production capacity. We funded the cash portion of the purchase price for the Alpine acquisition with our existing credit facilities and also issued 481,540 shares of our common stock to fund the equity portion of the purchase price.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Dave's Killer Bread acquisition - On September 12, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Dave's Killer Bread ( DKB\u201d) for total cash payments of approximately $282.1 million inclusive of payments for certain tax benefits. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination and is included in our DSD Segment. We believe the acquisition strengthens our position as the second-largest baker in the U.S. by giving us greater access to the fast growing organic bread category and expanding our geographic reach into the Pacific Northwest. DKB operates one production facility in Milwaukie, Oregon. We funded the purchase price of the DKB acquisition with cash on hand and borrowings from our existing credit facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Amendment to accounts receivable securitization facility - On August 20, 2015, we amended our accounts receivable securitization facility (the facility\u201d) to extend the term to August 11, 2017 and to add a leverage pricing grid. The amendment was accounted for as a modification. We drew down on the facility to fund the purchase price of the DKB acquisition.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Plant closing - During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we closed our DSD Segment production facility located in Morristown, Tennessee and relocated this production to one of our other DSD Segment facilities located in Knoxville, Tennessee. Costs associated with the closure were $0.7 million and are included in our fiscal 2015 results of operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Impairment of assets - During fiscal 2015 and 2014, we recorded impairment charges of $2.3 million and $5.8 million, respectively, on certain properties that are currently held for sale. Additionally, during fiscal 2015, we decided to close a production line at one of our DSD Segment bakeries and transition this production to another facility, recording an impairment loss of $1.5 million on the equipment we no longer intend to use. During the second quarter of 2014, we decided to sell certain assets at our Ft. Worth, Texas tortilla facility and recognized an impairment loss on goodwill of $2.6 million and an impairment loss of $1.9 million on assets to be scrapped. The sale was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Amendment to the credit facility - On April 21, 2015, we amended our existing senior unsecured revolving loan facility (the credit facility\u201d). The amendment to the credit facility extended the term to April 21, 2020, reduced the applicable margin on base rate and Eurodollar loans and reduced the facility fees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Opening of Lenexa, Kansas bakery - During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we opened the bread line at our Lenexa bakery which was acquired as part of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets (defined below) in July 2013. We opened the bun line during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The bakery produces products for the Kansas, eastern Oklahoma, and Missouri markets under the Nature's Own, Wonder, and Home Pride brands.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Roman Meal trademark acquisition - On February 25, 2015, we announced that we acquired the Roman Meal trademark from the Roman Meal Company in Tacoma, Washington. This trademark acquisition for breads and buns in the United States and its territories, and in Mexico, Canada, Bermuda, and the Bahamas is being accounted for as an asset purchase and is being amortized over 20 years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Revision of prior period sales - During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we revised net sales. Historically, certain immaterial discounts had been recorded as an expense to selling, distribution and administrative costs. These discounts are now recorded as contra revenue. These revisions were made for all periods presented in the fiscal 2014 Form 10-K. See Note 3, Financial Statement Revisions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for more details.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Hostess acquired assets - On July 19, 2013, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Hostess Brands, Inc. ( Hostess\u201d), which included the Wonder, Nature's Pride, Merita, Home Pride and Butternut bread brands, 20 closed bakeries and 36 depots (the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets\u201d). Subsequent to the acquisition of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets, we determined that certain of these plants and depots do not fit into our long-term operating strategy, and we are actively marketing them for sale. Several of these plants and depots have already been sold and the remainder are classified as held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this Form 10-K. We expect these sales to continue into fiscal 2016. We received a total of $9.1 million during fiscal 2015 from the sale of these assets classified as held for sale. During fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, we recognized impairments of $2.0 million and $5.8 million, respectively, on certain of the plants and depots acquired as part of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets. Also, we recorded carrying costs associated with all the Acquired Hostess Bread Asset plants and depots not currently in operation of approximately $12.8 million, $19.5 million and $10.6 million during fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively. Carrying costs include workforce-related costs, property taxes, utilities and depreciation, among other costs. The carrying costs and impairment charges are included in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBusiness\nFlowers is focused on opportunities for growth within the baked foods category and seeks to have its products available wherever baked foods are consumed - whether in homes, restaurants, fast food outlets, institutions, or vending machines. The company has 49 operating bakeries in 18 states that produce a wide range of breads, buns, rolls, snack cakes, and tortillas.\nSegments and Delivery Methods\nThe company has two business segments that reflect its two distinct methods of delivering products to market. DSD Segment products are sold and delivered fresh to customers through a network of independent distributors who are incentivized to grow sales and to build equity in their distributorships. The DSD Segment reaches approximately 85% of the U.S. population with fresh bakery foods. The Warehouse Segment ships fresh and frozen products to customers' warehouses nationwide. Customers then distribute these products to their depots, stores, or restaurants. Flowers' bakeries fall into either the DSD Segment or Warehouse Segment depending on the primary method of delivery used to sell their products.\nThe DSD Segment operates a highly involved system of reciprocal baking whereby each bakery has an assigned production mission to produce certain items for its own market as well as for other DSD Segment bakeries' markets and the Warehouse Segment. This system allows for long and efficient production runs that help the company maintain its position as a low-cost producer. Bakeries within regional networks exchange products overnight through a third-party transportation system so that at the beginning of each sales day every DSD Segment bakery has a full complement of fresh products for the independent distributor to provide to retail and foodservice customers.\nThe company has invested significant capital in its bakeries for several decades to ensure its production is as efficient as possible, uses technology effectively, provides consistently excellent quality, and offers a good working environment for team members. In fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, the company had capital expenditures of $90.8 million, $83.8 million, and $99.2 million, respectively.\nConsumers and our product portfolio\nFlowers recognizes the need to stay in touch with changing consumer trends regarding baked foods. As a result, ongoing research on consumer preferences is conducted and outside resources are engaged to help ensure our bakery products remain on trend\nwith consumers' changing taste, texture, and flavor trends. Our marketing, quality assurance, and research and development teams collaborate regularly as new products are considered, developed, tested, and introduced.\nBrands are important in the bakery category and the company has invested over several decades in its brand portfolio through advertising, promotion, and packaging. Nature's Own, introduced in 1977, was developed to address the emerging trend of consumers demanding baked foods with a healthier profile. Nature's Own, from inception, has offered baked foods with no artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives.\nOn October 13, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Alpine and their product line of super premium organic and all-natural bread products. These products, which are warehouse delivered, are marketed under the Alpine Valley Bread brand and further extend our organic product line.\nOn September 12, 2015, we completed the DKB acquisition, which includes a full product line of super premium whole-grain 100% organic and non-GMO bakery products sold under the Dave's Killer Bread label, the leading organic bread brand in the U.S.\nOn July 19, 2013, we completed the acquisition of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets, which included the Wonder, Merita, Home Pride and Butternut brands. These brands were taken off the market when Hostess ceased operations in November 2012. Late in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we began re-introducing these brands to the marketplace within our DSD Segment. We plan to continue to re-introduce these brands as we expand into new markets.\nSnack cakes have been part of the company's product offerings since at least the early 1920s. In more recent years, snack cakes have been developed and introduced under several brands, such as Blue Bird and Mrs. Freshley's. In 2011, the company acquired Tasty Baking Co. ( Tasty\u201d) and its extensive line of Tastykake branded snack cakes. Since the acquisition of Tasty, we have expanded the distribution of the Tastykake products throughout our territories and expect to continue this expansion.\nIn 2014, we re-branded the Cobblestone Mill brand to the Cobblestone Bread Company brand. There were twelve core products and other regional favorites at introduction. This brand includes restaurant and sandwich shop inspired breads and rolls. We completed the roll-out to the full market in July 2014.\nStrengths and core competencies\nWe aim to achieve consistent and sustainable growth in sales and earnings by focusing on improvements in the operating results of our existing bakeries and, after detailed analysis, acquiring companies and properties that add value to the company. We believe this strategy has resulted in consistent and sustainable growth that will continue to build value for our shareholders.\nThe company is also committed to maintaining a collaborative, in-house information technology team, as well as certain outsourced services, that meets all of our bakeries' needs and maximizes efficiencies. The consumer packaged goods industry has used PBS over several years to share information between the supplier and retailer. An extension of this technology allows the retailer to pay the supplier when the consumer purchases the goods rather than at the time they are delivered to the retailer. In addition, PBS permits the manufacturer to more accurately track trends in product sales and manage inventory. In fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, the company recorded $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively, in sales through PBS.\nWe regularly articulate our core business strategies to the investment community and internally to our team members, including long-term (five-year) goals. Compensation and bonus programs are linked to the company's short and long-term goals. The majority of our employees participate in an annual formula-driven, performance-based cash bonus program. In addition, certain employees participate in a long-term incentive program that provides performance-contingent common stock awards that generally vest over a two-year period. We believe these incentive programs provide both a short and long-term goal for our most senior management team and aligns their interests with those of our shareholders.\nWe believe our highly automated bakeries, with teams that focus on quality, bake products that meet consumers' needs. We strive to maintain and exceed service levels for our customers, consumers, and suppliers. The design of our delivery systems and segments permits us to allocate management time and resources to meet marketplace expectations.\nCompetition and risks\nHostess' liquidation in late November 2012 impacted the industry as Hostess sales shifted to other providers to meet marketplace needs. These providers included Flowers, Grupo Bimbo (with Sara Lee, Arnolds, Thomas, and Entenmann's brands), Campbell Soup Company (with the Pepperidge Farm brand), McKee Foods Corporation (Little Debbie) and smaller regional bakeries, retailer-owned bakeries, and store brands. Certain Hostess cake products were re-introduced into the market in July 2013 by a new and\nseparate company, Hostess Brands, LLC ( Hostess LLC\u201d), formed by the outside investment group of Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulous & Co.\nSales are principally affected by pricing, quality, brand recognition, new product introductions, product line extensions, marketing, and service. Sales for fiscal 2015 increased 0.8% as compared to fiscal 2014. This change was due to both volume increases and the DKB and Alpine acquisition contribution, partially offset by the lack of a 53rd week in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nCommodities, such as our baking ingredients, periodically experience price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments in an effort to manage the impact of such volatility in raw material prices. Any decrease in the availability of these agreements and instruments could increase the effective price of these raw materials to us and significantly affect our earnings.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nNote 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe company's discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues, expenses, and cash flows during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer programs and incentives, bad debts, raw materials, inventories, long-lived assets, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, and contingencies and litigation. The company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe selection and disclosure of the company's critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the company's audit committee. The following, in no particular order of importance, is a review of the critical assumptions and estimates, and the accounting policies and methods listed below, which are used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements:\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> revenue recognition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> derivative instruments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> self-insurance reserves;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> income tax expense and accruals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> pension obligations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> stock-based compensation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> commitments and contingencies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition. The company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products at the time of delivery when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The company records both direct and estimated reductions to gross revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings at the time the incentive is offered or at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying transaction that results in progress by the customer towards earning the incentive. These allowances include price promotion discounts, coupons, customer rebates, cooperative advertising, and product returns. Price promotion discount expense is recorded as a reduction to gross sales when the discounted product is sold to the customer. If market conditions were to decline, the company may take actions to increase incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue.\nThe consumer packaged goods industry has used scan-based trading technology over several years to share information between the supplier and retailer. An extension of this technology allows the retailer to pay the supplier when the consumer purchases the goods rather than at the time they are delivered to the retailer. Consequently, revenue on these sales is not recognized until the product is purchased by the consumer. This technology is referred to as PBS. The company began a pilot program in fiscal 1999, working with\ncertain retailers to develop the technology to execute PBS, and there has been a sharp increase in its use since that time. In fiscal 2015, the company recorded $1.2 billion in sales through PBS. The company will continue to implement PBS technology for current PBS customers as they open new retail stores during 2016. In addition, new PBS customers will begin implementation during 2016. Revenue on PBS sales is recognized when the product is purchased by the end consumer because that is when title and risk of loss is transferred. Non-PBS sales are recognized when the product is delivered to the customer since that is when title and risk of loss is transferred.\nDerivative Instruments. The company's cost of primary raw materials is highly correlated to certain commodities markets. Commodities, such as our baking ingredients, experience price fluctuations. If actual market conditions become significantly different than those anticipated, raw material prices could increase significantly, adversely affecting our results of operations. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting to manage the impact of volatility in raw material prices. The company measures the fair value of its derivative portfolio using fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal market for that asset or liability. When quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities are not available, the company bases fair value on internally developed models that use current market observable inputs, such as exchange-quoted futures prices and yield curves.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The company records an impairment charge to property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting standards when, based on certain indicators of impairment, it believes such assets have experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of these underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset that may not be reflected in the asset's current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future. As discussed above, during fiscal 2015, we decided to close a production line at one of our bakeries and transition this production to another facility. We recognized an impairment loss of $1.5 million on the equipment we no longer intend to use. Based on management's evaluation, no impairment charges relating to long-lived held and used assets were recorded for fiscal years 2014 or 2013.\nThe company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its goodwill on an annual basis or at a time when events occur that indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may be impaired using a two-step process. We have elected not to perform the qualitative approach. The first step of this evaluation is performed by calculating the fair value of the business segment, or reporting unit, with which the goodwill is associated. Our reporting units are at the segment level. Each segment consists of several components. These components are aggregated by their respective delivery method into the Warehouse Segment and DSD Segment. These segments rely on reciprocal baking among their components, cross-sells their products/brands within the segment, and utilize the same delivery method. Marketing, research and development and capital projects are measured at the segment level. We believe these factors support our reporting unit classifications. This fair value is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, and if less than the carrying value, the goodwill is evaluated for potential impairment under step two. Under step two of this calculation, goodwill is measured for potential impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, determined in the same manner as a business combination, with the carrying amount of the goodwill.\nOur annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires management judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting units. Fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodologies incorporating market participant considerations and management's assumptions on revenue, revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, and EBITDA (defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). Our estimates can significantly affect the outcome of the test. We perform the fair value assessment using the income and market approach. We use this data to complete a separate fair value analysis for each reporting unit. Changes in our forecasted operating results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates. This test is performed in our fourth quarter unless circumstances require this analysis to be completed sooner. The income approach is tested using a sensitivity analysis to changes in the discount rate and yield a sufficient buffer to significant variances in our estimates. The estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded our carrying values in excess of $700 million in each reporting unit in fiscal 2015. Based on management's evaluation, other than the $2.6 million impairment loss related to our Ft. Worth, Texas tortilla facility discussed above, no other impairment charges relating to goodwill were recorded for the fiscal years 2015, 2014, or 2013.\nIn connection with acquisitions, the company has acquired trademarks, customer lists, and non-compete agreements, a portion of which are amortizable. The company evaluates these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The undiscounted future cash flows of each intangible asset is compared to the carrying amount, and if less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. The fair value is computed using the same approach described above for goodwill and includes the same risks and estimates. The fair value of the trademarks could be less than our carrying value if any of our four material assumptions in our fair value analysis: (a) weighted average cost of capital; (b) long-term sales growth rates; (c) forecasted operating margins; and (d) market multiples do not meet our expectations, thereby requiring us to record an asset impairment. We use the multi-period excess earnings and relief from royalty methods to value these intangibles. The method used for impairment testing purposes is consistent with the\nvaluation method employed at acquisition of the intangible asset. Based on management's evaluation, no impairment charges relating to amortizable intangible assets were recorded for the fiscal years 2015, 2014, or 2013.\nThe company also owns $414.0 million of trademarks acquired in acquisitions that are indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization. A total of $144.0 million of the trademarks were from the Lepage acquisition that occurred in July 2012. A total of $79.5 million and $189.0 million of the trademarks were from the Sara Lee California and the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets acquisitions, respectively, both completed in fiscal 2013. The company evaluates the recoverability by comparing the fair value to the carrying value of these intangible assets on an annual basis or at a time when events occur that indicate the carrying value may be impaired. In addition, the assets are evaluated to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite life. The fair value is compared to the carrying value of the intangible asset, and if less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to fair value. During fiscal 2015, in conjunction with the DKB and Alpine acquisitions, we determined that the Barowsky's trademark acquired in the Lepage acquisition would be used on a more regional basis as an organic brand rather than distributed nationally, and therefore is deemed to have a finite life. We began amortizing this trademark in fiscal 2015.\nThere are certain inherent risks included in our expectations about the performance of acquired trademarks and brands. If we are unable to implement our growth strategies for these acquired intangible assets as expected, it could adversely impact the carrying value of the brands. The fair value of the trademarks could be less than our carrying value if any of our four material assumptions in our fair value analysis: (a) weighted average cost of capital; (b) long-term sales growth rates; (c) forecasted operating margins; and (d) market multiples do not meet our expectations, thereby requiring us to record an asset impairment. There were no impairments recorded on intangible assets not subject to amortization for the fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nThe impairment analysis on the indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization is very sensitive to the long-term growth rates of the brand. The brands acquired in the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets have been valued based on our expectation of the timing reintroducing the brands. The company is also continually analyzing these brands to determine the expansion markets in which they will be introduced. If the timing of our expansion does not proceed as we currently anticipate, these brands could become impaired.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves. We are self-insured for various levels of general liability, auto liability, workers' compensation, and employee medical and dental coverage. Insurance reserves are calculated on an undiscounted basis and are based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed utilizing historical claim trends. Projected settlements and incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on pending claims and historical trends and data. Though the company does not expect them to do so, actual settlements and claims could differ materially from those estimated. Material differences in actual settlements and claims could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncome Tax Expense and Accruals. The annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in statutory rates and tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material effect on the annual tax rate. The effect of these changes, if any, would be recognized when the change takes place.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserve for uncertain tax benefits reflect our best assessment of future taxes to be paid in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if we believe it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance, which could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.\nPeriodically, we face audits from federal and state tax authorities, which can result in challenges regarding the timing and amount of income or deductions. We provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it more likely than not that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these reserves on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements that may impact the ultimate payment of such potential exposures. While the ultimate outcome of audits cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently believe that current or future audits will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The company is no longer subject to federal examination for years prior to fiscal 2012 and is currently under audit for fiscal years 2012 through 2014.\nPension Obligations. The company records pension costs and benefit obligations related to its defined benefit plans based on actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect key assumptions determined by management, including the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and mortality. Material changes in pension costs and in benefit obligations may occur in the future due to experience that is different than assumed and changes in these assumptions.\nEffective January 1, 2006, the company curtailed its largest defined benefit plan (Plan No. 1) that covered the majority of its workforce. Benefits under this plan are frozen, and no future benefits will accrue under this plan. The company assumed sponsorship of two defined benefit plans as part of the ButterKrust acquisition (2008) and a qualified defined benefit plan as part of the Tasty acquisition (2011); benefits under these plans are frozen, and no future benefits will accrue under these plans. The ButterKrust plans and the Tasty plan were merged into Plan No. 1 effective December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012, respectively. In addition to Plan No. 1, the company sponsors an ongoing defined benefit pension plan for union employees (Plan No. 2) and a frozen nonqualified plan covering former Tasty executives.\nThe company recorded pension income of $6.0 million on our qualified defined benefit plans for fiscal 2015. We recorded pension cost of $5.6 million for fiscal 2014 (inclusive of a $15.4 million settlement charge for lump sums paid in the fourth quarter of 2014). We expect pension income of approximately $6.2 million on our qualified defined benefit plans for fiscal 2016.\nIn September 2014, the company announced a one-time voluntary lump sum offer to approximately 2,500 former employees in Plan No. 1 and 2 who had not yet started receiving monthly payments of their vested benefits. The offer supported the company's pension risk management strategy and reduced plan obligations by 10%. Distributions of $50.4 million in lump sums from existing plan assets for Plan 1 and Plan 2 in December 2014 resulted in a settlement charge of $15.4 million for Plan No. 1 only. No settlement charge was required for Plan No. 2 as the distributions were not in excess of service costs and interest costs for fiscal 2014.\nOn January 1, 2016, the company began providing pension plan participants who have not yet started their payments the option to receive their benefit as a single lump sum payment. Participants can elect this option when they retire or when they leave the company. This change supports our long-term pension risk management strategy. The amount of the lump sum payments may trigger a settlement charge in fiscal 2016 but at this time we are not able to estimate the possible impact, if any.\nIn 2016, we will refine the method used to estimate service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs. Historically, we estimated the service cost and interest cost components using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. Going forward, we will use a spot rate approach to estimate these components of benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows, as we believe this provides a better estimate of service and interest costs. We consider this a change in estimate and accordingly, will account for it prospectively starting in 2016. This change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligation.\nIn developing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at each measurement date, the company considers the plan assets' historical actual returns, targeted asset allocations, and the anticipated future economic environment and long-term performance of individual asset classes, based on the company's investment strategy. While appropriate consideration is given to recent and historical investment performance, the assumption represents management's best estimate of the long-term prospective return. Based on these factors, the long-term rate of return assumption for the plans was set at 8.0% for fiscal 2015, as compared with the average annual return on the plans' assets over the past 15 years of approximately 6.9% (net of expenses). The plan has an average annual rate of return since inception in 1987 of 9.1% (net of expenses). The expected long-term rate of return assumption is based on a target asset allocation of 40-60% equity securities, 10-40% fixed income securities, 0-25% real estate, 0-40% other diversifying strategies (including, absolute return funds, hedged equity funds, and guaranteed insurance contracts), and 0-25% short-term investments and cash. The company regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the plan assets to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Pension costs do not include an explicit expense assumption and the return on assets rate reflects the long-term expected return, net of expenses. For the details of our pension plan assets, see Note 19, Postretirement Plans, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nThe company utilizes the Society of Actuaries' ( SOA\u201d) published mortality tables and improvement scales in developing their best estimates of mortality. In October 2014, the SOA published final reports on their standard\u201d mortality table ( RP-2014\u201d) and mortality improvement scale ( MP-2014\u201d). In October 2015, the SOA published a revised mortality improvement scale ( MP-2015\u201d). Based on an evaluation of the information released in 2015, the Company updated the mortality assumptions for purposes of measuring pension benefit obligations at year-end 2015. The Company will continue to use the standard mortality tables and mortality improvement scale with adjustments to the base table as applicable: 15% adjustment for Plan No. 1 and blue collar adjustment for Plan No. 2. The change to the mortality assumption decreased the year-end pension benefit obligations by $6.3 million.\nThe company determines the fair value of substantially all of its plans' assets utilizing market quotes rather than developing smoothed\u201d values, market related\u201d values, or other modeling techniques. Plan asset gains or losses in a given year are included with other actuarial gains and losses due to remeasurement of the plans' projected benefit obligations ( PBO\u201d). If the total unrecognized gain or loss exceeds 10% of the larger of (i) the PBO or (ii) the market value of plan assets, the excess of the total unrecognized gain or loss is amortized over the expected average future lifetime of participants in the frozen pension plans. The total unrecognized loss as of December 31, 2015 for the pension plans the company sponsors is $144.1 million. The company uses a calendar year end for the measurement date since the plans are based on a calendar year and because it approximates the company's fiscal year end.\nAmortization of this unrecognized loss during fiscal 2016 is expected to be approximately $6.2 million. To the extent that this unrecognized loss is subsequently recognized, the loss will increase the company's pension costs in the future.\nA sensitivity analysis of fiscal 2015 pension costs on a pre-tax basis and year-end benefit obligations for our qualified plans is presented in the table below (amounts in thousands) to changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets ( EROA\u201d):\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> Percentage increase (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25%\nDiscount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.25%)\nDiscount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25%\nEROA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.25%)\nEROA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estimated change in FY 2015 pension costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (121\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (927\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estimated change in FY 2015 year-end benefit\nobligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,651\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted is determined based on the grant date fair value. The company recognizes these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate, and recognizes compensation cost only for those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term of the share-based payment award.\nEmployee grants issued before fiscal 2012 included non-qualified stock options ( NQSOs\u201d) and performance-contingent stock awards ( PSAs\u201d). The NQSOs were valued using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The inputs for the model include an expected life, risk-free rate, expected volatility, and dividend yield. The PSAs incorporated a market and performance condition component. However, because of the market condition the expense amount would only change if we determined the performance condition was triggered. The performance condition was always satisfied and adjustments were never made. The market condition was dependent on certain market benchmarks but the expense for these awards never changed.\nIn fiscal 2013, 2014, and 2015, we granted PSAs that separately have a market and performance condition. The expense computed for the total shareholder return shares ( TSR\u201d) is fixed and recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The expense computed for the return on invested capital ( ROIC\u201d) shares can change depending on the attainment of performance condition goals. The expense for the ROIC shares can be within a range of 0% to 125% of the target. There is a possibility that this expense component will change in subsequent quarters depending on how the company performs relative to the ROIC target. The payouts for the TSR and ROIC shares to be issued in fiscal 2016 (on the 2014 awards) are estimated to be 27% and 96%, respectively.\nOur Chief Executive Officer ( CEO\u201d) received a time-based restricted stock award of approximately $1.3 million in 2013, which will vest 100% on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant provided the CEO remains employed by the company during this time. This award is being expensed on a straight line basis over the four year vesting period.\nCommitments and contingencies. The company and its subsidiaries from time to time are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including personal injury, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, product liability, health and safety and employment matters, including lawsuits related to the independent distributors, which are being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. While the company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it believes, based upon currently available facts, that it is remote that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its overall financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future. However, adverse developments could negatively impact earnings in a particular future fiscal period.\nResults of Operations\nMatters Affecting Analysis\nFiscal 2014 Week 53. The sales impact in our Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal 2014 week 53 was $63.2 million. The DSD Segment and Warehouse Segment impact was $53.4 million and $9.8 million, respectively. The impact to fiscal 2014 earnings per share was $0.01 per share.\nReporting Periods. The company operates on a 52-53 week fiscal year ending the Saturday nearest December 31. Fiscal 2014 consisted of 53 weeks. Fiscal 2015 and 2013 consisted of 52 weeks.\nRevision of prior period sales and Impairment of Assets. Refer to the Overview\u201d section above for a description of each of these items. Acquisitions are described below.\nAlpine Valley Bread acquisition (2015)\nOn October 13, 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Alpine Valley Bread Company, a family-owned producer of certified organic and all natural breads in the U.S. The acquisition expands our penetration into the organic market and provides additional organic production capacity.\nDave's Killer Bread acquisition (2015)\nOn September 12, 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Dave's Killer Bread, the nation's best-selling organic bread. We believe the acquisition of DKB strengthens our position as the second-largest baker in the U.S. by giving us access to the fast growing organic bread category and expanding our geographic reach into the Pacific Northwest.\nModesto, California acquisition (2013)\nOn July 27, 2013, the company completed the acquisition of certain assets related to a bun line in Modesto, California that now serves the California market for a total cash payment of $10.3 million. This acquisition is included in our DSD Segment and the total goodwill for this acquisition was $4.2 million.\nHostess Bread assets acquisition (2013)\nOn July 19, 2013, the company completed the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets acquisition for a total cash payment of $355.3 million. We continue to incur carrying costs on the acquired properties and depots not currently in operation and in fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, these costs were $12.8 million, $19.5 million and $10.6 million, respectively. These costs include workforce-related costs, property taxes, utilities, and depreciation, among other costs and were primarily included in the materials, supplies, labor, and other production costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately) line item in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. We began re-introducing the brands associated with the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets to the marketplace in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.\nSara Lee California acquisition (2013)\nOn February 23, 2013, the company completed its acquisition of certain assets and trademark licenses from BBU, Inc., a subsidiary of Grupo Bimbo, SAB de CV ( BBU\u201d), for a total cash payment of $50.0 million. The company acquired from BBU in the acquisition: (1) perpetual, exclusive, and royalty-free licenses to the Sara Lee and Earthgrains brands for sliced breads, buns, and rolls in the state of California and (2) a closed bakery in Stockton, California. In addition, we received a perpetual, exclusive, and royalty-free license to the Earthgrains brand for a broad range of fresh bakery products in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma market area. We financed this acquisition with cash on hand and debt. We believe the California acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase because the Department of Justice (the DOJ\u201d) required BBU to divest these assets, which resulted in a more favorable price to us than would have normally resulted from a typical arms-length negotiation. Accordingly, the fair value of the assets acquired exceeded the consideration paid by approximately $50.1 million after tax. The company agreed to a $10.0 million escrow holdback provision as a part of the Sara Lee California acquisition of which the company received $7.5 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The escrow holdback is described in more detail in Note 8, Acquisitions, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nThe company's results of operations, expressed as a

non-retail categories. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the additional week in fiscal 2014 which affected all categories, and volume declines in the store branded retail category. The increase in branded retail sales was due primarily to the DKB and Alpine acquisition contribution, volume increases from the re-introduction of the brands we acquired as part of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets and growth in our expansion markets (defined as new markets we entered into in the last five years), partially offset by the impact of the additional week in fiscal 2014. The decrease in store branded retail sales was due primarily to volume decreases from certain exited business, a shift to branded products and the impact of the additional week in fiscal 2014. The increase in non-retail and other sales, which include contract manufacturing, vending and foodservice, was largely due to significant volume increases in foodservice. The increase was partially offset by volume declines in contract manufacturing due to exiting the non-retail tortilla business in the second half of fiscal 2014, as well as declines in pricing/mix and the impact of the additional week in fiscal 2014.\nDSD Segment Sales\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52 weeks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53 weeks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amounts in\nthousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amounts in\nthousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Branded Retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,010,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,971,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Store Branded Retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 457,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 486,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-retail and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 711,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 696,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,179,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,155,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 0.8% increase in sales was attributable to the following:\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> Percentage Point Change in Sales Attributed to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Favorable\n(Unfavorable)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pricing/Mix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 53 impact from Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Percentage Change in Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales category discussion\nThe increase in branded retail sales was due primarily to the DKB acquisition contribution and volume increases driven by the re-introduction of the brands we acquired as part of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets and in our expansion markets, partially offset by the impact of the additional week in fiscal 2014.

Ingredient costs decreased as a percent of sales largely due to lower prices for flour, sweeteners and oils and increases in outside purchases of product (sales with no associated ingredient costs), partially offset by higher egg prices and higher costs for the organic ingredients. This outside purchased product is included in the other line item above and largely relates to purchases of DKB products from co-manufacturers due to capacity constraints and higher outside purchases of product for the Warehouse Segment. Increases in workforce-related costs as a percent of sales primarily resulted from higher employee incentive costs and the incremental costs of adding productions lines, partially offset by increases in outside purchases of product (sales with no associated workforce-related costs).\nCommodities, such as our baking ingredients, periodically experience price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments in an effort to manage the impact of such volatility in raw material prices. Any decrease in the availability of these agreements and instruments could increase the effective price of these raw materials to us and significantly affect our earnings.\nThe table below presents the significant components of materials, supplies, labor, and other production costs for the DSD Segment (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately):\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> Line item component\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n% of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n% of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease) as a\n% of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ingredients\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Workforce-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Packaging\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Utilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe DSD Segment's decrease in ingredient costs as a percent of sales was attributable to lower pricing on flour, sweeteners and oils for core bakeries, decreases in sales of product to the Warehouse Segment (ingredient costs with no associated sales), increases in outside purchases of product (sales with no associated ingredient cost) and lower stales.

Acquisition-related costs of $6.2 million, as well as higher legal and consulting costs in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 caused the majority of the increase in the other line item component.\nThe table below presents the significant components of our DSD Segment selling, distribution and administrative expenses as a percent of sales:\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> Line item component\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n% of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n% of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease) as a\n% of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Workforce-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distributor distribution fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in workforce-related costs as a percent of sales was attributable to lower costs for DKB as a percent of sales, conversions to independent distributors in newer markets, improvements at Lepage and implementing cost saving initiatives, partially offset by higher employee incentive costs. The majority of the DKB products were distributed via warehouse delivery and we anticipate this to continue into fiscal 2016 while we are converting these sales to the direct-store-delivery method. This resulted in distributor distribution fees remaining consistent with the prior fiscal year as a percent of sales.\nThe table below presents the significant components of our Warehouse Segment selling, distribution and administrative expenses as a percent of sales:\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> Line item component\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n% of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n% of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease) as a\n% of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Workforce-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Freezer storage/rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distribution costs (includes freight and shipping and hauling)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWorkforce-related costs increased primarily due to higher employee incentive costs as compared to the prior year on smaller sales increases. Additionally, higher marketing costs as a percent of sales drove the increase in the other line item, mainly attributable to marketing initiatives for the Alpine products.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in dollars and as a percent of sales due primarily to the DKB and Alpine acquisitions. We preliminarily recorded $240.9 million of amortizing intangible assets related to the DKB and Alpine acquisitions and we expect amortization expense to continue to be higher in fiscal 2016 as a result of this.\nThe DSD Segment's depreciation and amortization expense increased in dollars primarily due to the amortization of the acquired DKB intangible assets, partially offset by lower depreciation expense.\nThe Warehouse Segment's depreciation and amortization expense increase in dollars and as a percent of sales was mostly the result of the amortization of the acquired Alpine intangible assets.\nPension Plan Settlement Loss. We recorded a settlement charge of $15.4 million during the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2014 related to our pension risk mitigation plan. Refer to the discussion in Pension Obligations in the Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d section above for additional details.\nImpairment of Assets. We recorded impairments of assets of $3.8 million and $10.3 million during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. Refer to the Impairment of Assets discussion in the Overview\u201d section above for additional details.\nIncome from Operations. The table below summarizes the change in operating income by segment as a percent of sales:\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Favorable\n(Unfavorable)\nPercentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DSD Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Warehouse Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe favorable increase in the DSD Segment income from operations was largely attributable to sales increases, lower ingredient costs and lower asset impairment charges in the current year as compared to the prior year. The Warehouse Segment's favorable increase was largely attributable to exiting the lower margin non-retail tortilla business in the second half of fiscal 2014, partially offset by higher selling, distribution and administrative costs as a percent of sales. The favorable decrease in the unallocated corporate expense was largely due to the $15.4 million pension plan settlement loss recorded in fiscal 2014, mostly offset by $6.2 million of acquisition-related costs, higher legal and consulting costs and lower pension income recorded in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nNet Interest Expense. The decrease resulted from lower average debt outstanding during the current fiscal year and lower average interest rates on debt outstanding, as well as, higher interest income in fiscal 2015 due to higher average distributor notes receivable outstanding during the current fiscal year. We expect net interest expense to be elevated in fiscal 2016 due to the drawdowns to fund the acquisitions completed in fiscal 2015.\nIncome Taxes. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 was 35.4% and 34.4%, respectively. The increase in the rate was primarily related to a reduction in the Section 199 qualifying production activities deduction and certain nondeductible\nacquisition-related costs. The most significant differences in the effective rate and the statutory rate were related to additions for state income taxes, partially offset by reductions for the Section 199 qualifying production activities deduction.\nFiscal 2014 compared to Fiscal 2013\nConsolidated Sales\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53 weeks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52 weeks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amounts in\nthousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amounts in\nthousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Branded Retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,102,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,038,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Store Branded Retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 608,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 645,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-retail and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,038,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,048,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,748,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,732,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 0.4% increase in sales was attributable to the following:\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> Percentage Point Change in Sales Attributed to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Favorable\n(Unfavorable)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pricing/Mix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition (Sara Lee California until cycled)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Percentage Change in Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales category discussion\nOverall, sales increased due to the additional week in fiscal 2014 which affected all categories, as well as favorable pricing/mix due to a shift from lower margin cake items and store branded bread, buns, and rolls to higher margin branded bread, buns and rolls, and the Sara Lee California acquisition contribution. These increases were partially offset by volume declines in our cake business, store branded breads, buns and rolls and foodservice business, and increased promotional activity. The re-introduction of the Hostess cake brands by a competitor negatively impacted our cake sales and certain store branded and foodservice business was exited during the fiscal year. The increase in branded retail sales was due primarily to volume increases from the re-introduction of the brands we acquired as part of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets, growth in our expansion markets and the Sara Lee California acquisition, partially offset by significant volume declines in branded cake. The decrease in store branded retail sales was due primarily to volume decreases in branded cake and certain exited business. The decrease in non-retail and other sales, which include contract manufacturing, vending and foodservice, was largely due to volume decreases in foodservice, institutional and vending sales, partially offset by positive pricing/mix. Sales from the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets are not included in the acquisition contribution because Hostess filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations in November 2012. As a result, there were no sales from the Acquired Hostess Bread Asset brands between November 2012 and our reintroduction of the Acquired Hostess Bread Asset brands in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.\nDSD Segment Sales\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53 weeks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52 weeks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amounts in\nthousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amounts in\nthousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Branded Retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,971,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,898,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Store Branded Retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 486,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 504,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-retail and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 696,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 677,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,155,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,080,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2.4% increase in sales was attributable to the following:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> Percentage Point Change in Sales Attributed to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Favorable\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pricing/Mix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition (Sara Lee California until cycled)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Percentage Change in Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales category discussion\nSales increased due to the additional week in fiscal 2014 which impacted all categories, as well as volume increases resulting from the re-introduction of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets, growth in our expansion markets and to a lesser extent, the Sara Lee California acquisition.

Ingredient costs decreased as a percent of sales largely due to lower prices for sweeteners, oils and flour, partially offset by higher gluten costs and decreases in outside purchases of product (sales with no associated ingredient costs). This outside purchased product is included in the other line item above and largely relates to purchases from BBU in the prior year for the Sara Lee product. Increases in workforce-related costs as a percent of sales primarily resulted from lower sales for the Warehouse Segment and decreases in outside purchases of product (sales with no associated workforce-related costs).\nCommodities, such as our baking ingredients, periodically experience price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments in an effort to manage the impact of such volatility in raw material prices. Any decrease in the availability of these agreements and instruments could increase the effective price of these raw materials to us and significantly affect our earnings.\nThe table below presents the significant components of materials, supplies, labor, and other production costs for the DSD Segment (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately):\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> Line item component\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> FY 2014\n% of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> FY 2013\n% of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease) as a\n% of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ingredients\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Workforce-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Packaging\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Utilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe DSD Segment's decrease in ingredient costs as a percent of sales was attributable to lower pricing on sweeteners, oils and flour, partially offset by decreases in sales of outside purchased products (sales with no associated ingredient costs) and higher gluten prices. Workforce-related costs increased as a percent of sales primarily due to decreased outside purchases of product (sales with no associated workforce-related costs). This outside purchased product is included in the other line item above and largely relates to purchases from BBU in the prior year for the Sara Lee product. The increase in the other line item is due to decreases in sales of product to and increases in purchases from the Warehouse Segment and increases in other carrying costs associated with the acquired Hostess facilities, mostly offset by decreases in outside purchases of product.\nThe table below presents the significant components of materials, supplies, labor and other production costs for the Warehouse Segment (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately):\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> Line item component\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> FY 2014\n% of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> FY 2013\n% of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease) as a\n% of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ingredients\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Workforce-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Packaging\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Utilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Warehouse Segment's decrease in ingredient costs as a percent of sales was primarily attributed to lower ingredient pricing, partially offset by increased sales to the DSD Segment (ingredient costs with no associated sales). The decreases in sales volume and increased sales to the DSD Segment increased workforce-related costs as a percent of sales (workforce-related costs with no associated sales). The increase in packaging was due primarily to price increases and increased sales to the DSD Segment (packaging costs with no associated sales). The decrease in the other line item is primarily due to decreased purchases of product from the DSD Segment and, to a lesser extent, increased sales of product to the DSD Segment.\nSelling, Distribution and Administrative Expenses.

Workforce-related costs decreased due to the conversion to independent distributors, partially offset by costs associated with the Lepage integration and lower sales for the Warehouse Segment. Prior year acquisition-related costs of $17.8 million caused the majority of the decline in the other line item component.\nThe table below presents the significant components of our DSD Segment selling, distribution and administrative expenses as a percent of sales:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> Line item component\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> FY 2014\n% of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> FY 2013\n% of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease) as a\n% of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Workforce-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distributor distribution fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in workforce-related costs was attributable to the conversion to independent distributors discussed above which corresponds to the increase in distributor distribution fees.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased in dollars and as a percent of sales due primarily to the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets, the Henderson, Nevada bakery placed into operation, the acquisition of a bun line in Modesto, California and their bread line added in fiscal 2014, and certain capital leases entered into during fiscal 2014.\nThe DSD Segment's depreciation and amortization expense increased in dollars and as a percent of sales primarily due to the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets, the Henderson, Nevada bakery placed into operation, the acquisition of certain assets related to a bun line in Modesto, California and their bread line added in fiscal 2014, and certain capital leases entered into during fiscal 2014.\nThe Warehouse Segment's depreciation and amortization expense increase as a percent of sales was the result of significantly lower sales in fiscal 2014 as compared to the prior year.\nPension Plan Settlement Loss. We recorded a settlement charge of $15.4 million during the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2014 related to our pension risk mitigation plan. Refer to the discussion in Pension Obligations in the Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d section above for additional details.\nImpairment of Assets. We recorded impairments of assets of $10.3 million during fiscal 2014. Refer to the Impairment of Assets discussion in the Overview\u201d section above for additional details.\nIncome from Operations. The table below summarizes the change in operating income by segment as a percent of sales:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Favorable\n(Unfavorable)\nPercentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DSD Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Warehouse Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe unfavorable decrease in the DSD Segment income from operations was largely attributable to the gain on acquisition recorded for the Sara Lee California acquisition in fiscal 2013 as discussed above. The gain on acquisition accounted for 13.8% of the DSD Segment decrease in operating income. Excluding the gain on acquisition, the decrease was 4.3% which was driven by the impairment of assets discussed in the Overview\u201d section above, higher costs for the acquired Hostess facilities, and the Lepage integration costs, partially offset by lower ingredient costs. The unfavorable decrease in the Warehouse Segment income from operations was primarily due to sales decreases which were driven by volume declines as discussed above, partially offset by lower ingredient costs. The favorable decrease in unallocated corporate expenses was primarily due to the prior year acquisition costs associated with the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets and the Sara Lee California acquisition in fiscal 2013 and higher pension income in fiscal 2014 as compared to the prior year, partially offset by the pension plan settlement loss discussed above.\nNet Interest Expense. The decrease resulted from higher interest income in fiscal 2014 due to an increase in distributor notes receivables outstanding as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nIncome Taxes. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 was 34.4% and 28.4%, respectively. The fiscal 2013 rate was driven by the gain on acquisition, which was recorded net of deferred taxes as a component of income before income taxes. The fiscal 2013 gain was treated as a permanent item in the tax provision, and favorably impacted the rate by approximately 5.2%. The\nother significant differences in the effective rate and the statutory rate are additions for state income taxes, offset by reductions for the Section 199 qualifying production activities deduction, and discrete tax benefits.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity represents our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments as well as our ability to obtain appropriate financing and to convert into cash those assets that are no longer required to meet existing strategic and financing objectives. Therefore, liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist primarily of current and potentially available funds for use in achieving long-range business objectives. Currently, the company's liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements and capital expenditures. The company's strategy for use of its cash flow includes paying dividends to shareholders, making acquisitions, growing internally, and repurchasing shares of its common stock, when appropriate. We believe we have access to available funds to meet our short and long-term capital requirements.\nAs discussed in the Overview section above, we completed the DKB acquisition on September 12, 2015 which required $282.1 million of cash and the Alpine acquisition on October 13, 2015 which required $109.3 million of cash and the issuance of 481,540 shares of our common stock. We funded the cash paid for the acquisitions and acquisition-related costs with cash on hand and funds available under the accounts receivable securitization and the credit facilities.\nThe company leases certain property and equipment under various operating and capital lease arrangements. Most of the operating leases provide the company with the option, after the initial lease term, either to purchase the property at the then fair value or renew its lease at the then fair value. The capital leases provide the company with the option to purchase the property at a fixed price at the end of the lease term. The company believes the use of leases as a financing alternative places the company in a more favorable position to fulfill its long-term strategy for the use of its cash flow. See Note 12, Debt, Lease and Other Commitments, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for detailed financial information regarding the company's lease arrangements.\nLiquidity discussion Fiscal 2015 (52 Weeks) compared to Fiscal 2014 (53 Weeks)\nFlowers Foods' cash and cash equivalents were $14.4 million at January 2, 2016 as compared to $7.5 million at January 3, 2015.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of these activities. The decrease in stock-based compensation was primarily due to the lower expected vesting percentage of the ROIC shares awarded in fiscal 2014. See Note 16, Stock-Based Compensation, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for a more detailed description of our award types. The change in deferred income taxes was primarily due to an increase in favorable temporary differences. The pension and postretirement plan expense decreased primarily because of the settlement loss of $15.4 million in fiscal 2014. Other non-cash items include non-cash interest expense for the amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs and gains or losses on the sale of assets.\nThe changes in accounts receivable and inventories are described above and are due to sales increases. Hedging activities change from market movements that affect the fair value and required collateral of positions and the timing and recognition of deferred gains or losses. These changes will occur as part of our hedging program. The other assets and accrued liabilities changes are from changes in income tax receivable balances, deferred tax liabilities, accrued interest and accrued employee costs (including accrued compensation for our formula driven, performance-based cash bonus program). Note 10, Other Current and Noncurrent Assets, Note 11, Other Accrued Liabilities, and Note 20, Income Taxes, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K list material items in each respective category for additional context to changes in working capital.\nWe contributed $10.0 million in cash to our qualified pension plans in fiscal 2015. These contributions were discretionary. Additionally, we contributed $0.4 million from other corporate assets to our non-qualified pension plan. In fiscal 2014, there were required pension contributions under the minimum funding requirements of ERISA and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 ( PPA\u201d) to our qualified plans of $4.6 million and discretionary contributions of $8.4 million. In addition, there were $0.4 million in nonqualified pension benefits paid from corporate assets during fiscal 2014. During 2016, the company does not anticipate making any contributions to our qualified pension plans, but does expect to pay $0.4 million in nonqualified pension benefits from corporate assets. The expected contributions to qualified pension plans represent the estimated minimum pension contributions required under ERISA and the PPA as well as discretionary contributions to avoid benefit restrictions. The company believes its cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without adversely affecting the business strategy of the company.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we anticipate making payments of approximately $25.8 million, including our share of employment taxes, in performance-based cash awards under our bonus plan. During fiscal 2015, the company paid $16.4 million, including our share of employment taxes, in performance-based cash awards under the company's bonus plan. An additional $1.5 million for our share of employment taxes on the vesting of the performance-contingent restricted stock award was also paid during fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2014, the company paid $24.7 million, including our share of employment taxes, in performance-based cash awards under the company's bonus plan.\nCash Flows Disbursed for Investing Activities.

The acquisitions were funded from cash on hand and drawdowns from our existing credit facilities. Additionally, we acquired the Roman Meal trademark for $5.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. There were no acquisitions during fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2014, the company received $7.5 million for the cancelation of a co-pack agreement associated with the Sara Lee California acquisition. See Note 8, Acquisitions, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for more details on the acquisitions that occurred during the reporting periods. In fiscal 2015, we received proceeds of $9.1 million on the sale of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets plants and depots as compared to $24.2 million received in fiscal 2014. Additionally, in fiscal 2014, we received proceeds of $8.4 million from the sale of our Ft. Worth, Texas tortilla facility.\nCapital expenditures for the DSD Segment and Warehouse Segment were $72.1 million and $9.6 million, respectively, in fiscal 2015. The company currently estimates capital expenditures of approximately $90.0 million to $100.0 million on a consolidated basis during fiscal 2016. The change in the distributor territories repurchased and the principal payments on notes receivable are due to the sale of territories in newer markets in the current year and the implementation of the independent distributor model at Lepage during fiscal 2014.\nCash Flows Provided by (Disbursed for) Financing Activities.

While there are no requirements to increase the dividend payout we have shown a recent historical trend to do so. Should this continue in the future we will have additional cash needs to meet these expected payouts. As of January 2, 2016, there were nonqualified stock option grants of 4.4 million shares that were exercisable. These have a remaining contractual life of approximately 1.42 years and a weighted average exercise price of $10.97 per share. At this time, it is expected that these shares will be exercised before the contractual term expires and such exercises may provide an increase to the cash provided by financing activities.\nStock repurchase decisions are made based on our stock price, our belief of relative value, and our cash projections at any given time. The change in bank overdraft was a function of our cash receipts since the end of our fiscal 2014. Our cash objective is to minimize cash on hand by using the credit facility described below. The net debt obligations increased primarily from the drawdowns used to fund the acquisitions in fiscal 2015, net of repayments we made during the year.\nThe credit facility, securitization facility and new term loan are variable rate debt, as described below. In periods of rising interest rates the cost of using the credit facility will become more expensive and increase our interest expense. The stated interest rate of the senior notes will not change. Therefore, borrowings under the credit facility provide us the greatest direct exposure to rising rates. In addition, if interest rates do increase it will make the cost of funds more expensive. Considering our current debt obligations, an environment of rising rates could materially affect our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nLiquidity discussion Fiscal 2014 (53 Weeks) compared to Fiscal 2013 (52 Weeks)\nFlowers Foods' cash and cash equivalents were $7.5 million at January 3, 2015 as compared to $8.5 million at December 28, 2013.

Henderson, Nevada plant placed into operation, the Modesto, California bread line placed into service, and certain capital leases entered into during the year. Depreciation and amortization increased $10.0 million primarily as a result of these activities. The change in stock-based compensation was primarily because the awards granted in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 were full awards compared to a partial award granted in fiscal 2012. This caused an increase in the expense in fiscal 2014. See Note 16, Stock-Based Compensation, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for a more detailed description of our award types. The pension and postretirement plan expense increased because of the settlement loss of $15.4 million. Other non-cash items include non-cash interest expense for the amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs and gains or losses on the sale of assets.\nThe changes in accounts receivable and inventories are described above and are due to sales increases. Hedging activities change from market movements that affect the fair value and required collateral of positions and the timing and recognition of deferred gains or losses. These changes will occur as part of our hedging program. The other assets and accrued liabilities changes are from changes in income tax receivable balances, deferred tax liabilities, accrued interest and accrued employee costs (including accrued compensation for our formula driven, performance-based cash bonus program). Note 10, Other Current and Noncurrent Assets, Note 11, Other Accrued Liabilities, and Note 20, Income Taxes, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K list material items in each respective category for additional context to changes in working capital.\nIn fiscal 2014, there were required pension contributions under the minimum funding requirements of ERISA and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 ( PPA\u201d) to our qualified plans of $4.6 million and discretionary contributions of $8.4 million. In addition, there were $0.4 million in nonqualified pension benefits paid from corporate assets during fiscal 2014. The expected contributions to qualified pension plans represent the estimated minimum pension contributions required under ERISA and the PPA as well as discretionary contributions to avoid benefit restrictions.\nDuring fiscal 2014, the company paid $24.7 million, including our share of employment taxes, in performance-based cash awards under the company's bonus plan. During fiscal 2013, the company paid $23.7 million, including our share of employment taxes and deferred compensation contributions, relating to its formula-driven, performance-based cash bonus program.\nCash Flows Disbursed for Investing Activities.

There was an additional $0.2 million paid for the final working capital adjustment for the Lepage acquisition during the second quarter of fiscal 2013. The Acquired Hostess Bread Assets acquisition required approximately $337.0 million in cash when the acquisition closed on July 19, 2013. We previously paid $18.0 million as a deposit during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 that was applied to the purchase price of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets acquisition at closing. An additional $0.3 million was paid for the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets shortly after closing. The acquisition was funded from cash on hand and drawings under the new term loan and the securitization facility. There were no acquisitions during fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2014 the company did receive $7.5 million for the cancelation of a co-pack agreement associated with the Sara Lee California acquisition. See Note 8, Acquisitions, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for more details on the acquisitions that occurred during the reporting periods.\nCapital expenditures for the DSD Segment and Warehouse Segment were $73.5 million and $6.5 million, respectively. The change in the distributor territories repurchased and the principal payments on notes receivable are due to the Sara Lee California acquisition distributor territory during fiscal 2013 and for the implementation of the independent distributor model at Lepage. The $14.0 million in proceeds from the sale of new distribution territories was specifically for certain territories in California that were acquired outright from the company during fiscal 2013 and which were not financed at the time of acquisition. There were none of these in that market during fiscal 2014.\nCash Flows (Disbursed for) Provided by Financing Activities.

These have a remaining contractual life of approximately 2.27 years and a weighted average exercise price of $10.88 per share.\nStock repurchase decisions are made based on our stock price, our belief of relative value, and our cash projections at any given time. Payments for debt issuance costs changed because we incurred fees for the securitization facility and the new term loan, described in liquidity below, that were secured in fiscal 2013. The change in bank overdraft was a function of our cash receipts since the end of our fiscal 2013. The net debt obligations decreased primarily from the payments used to decrease our debt obligations.\nThe credit facility, the securitization facility and the new term loan are variable rate debt, as described below. In periods of rising interest rates the cost of using the credit facility will become more expensive and increase our interest expense. The stated interest rate of the senior notes will not change.\nAccounts Receivable Securitization Facility, New Term Loan, Senior Notes, Credit Facility, and Term Loan\nAccounts Receivable Securitization Facility. On July 17, 2013, the company entered into an accounts receivable securitization facility (the facility\u201d). On August 7, 2014, the company entered into an amendment to the facility. The amendment (i) increased the revolving commitments under the facility to $200.0 million from $150.0 million, (ii) extended the term one year to July 17, 2016, and (iii) made certain other conforming changes. On December 17, 2014, the company executed a second amendment to the facility to add a bank to the lending group. The original commitment amount was split between the original lender and the new lender in the proportion of 62.5% for the original lender and 37.5% for the new lender. This modification, which was accounted for as an extinguishment of the debt, resulted in a charge of $0.1 million, or 37.5%, of the unamortized financing costs. On August 20, 2015, the company executed a third amendment to the facility to extend the term to August 11, 2017 and to add a leverage pricing grid. This amendment was accounted for as a modification. Under the facility, a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary purchases, on an ongoing basis, substantially all trade receivables. As borrowings are made under the facility, the subsidiary pledges the receivables as collateral. In the event of liquidation of the subsidiary, its creditors would be entitled to satisfy their claims from the subsidiary's pledged receivables prior to distributions of collections to the company. We include the subsidiary in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The facility contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default. As of January 2, 2016, there was $170.0 million outstanding under the facility compared to no amounts outstanding as of January 3, 2015. As of January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, the company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants under the facility. On January 2, 2016, the company had $2.1 million available under its facility for working capital and general corporate purposes. Amounts available for withdrawal under the facility are determined as the lesser of the total commitments and a formula derived amount based on qualifying trade receivables.\nOptional principal repayments may be made at any time without premium or penalty. Interest is due two days after our reporting periods end in arrears on the outstanding borrowings and is computed as the cost of funds rate plus an applicable margin of 70 basis points. An unused fee of 25 basis points is applicable on the unused commitment at each reporting period. The company paid financing costs of $0.8 million in connection with the facility at the time we entered into the facility, which are being amortized over the life of the facility. During fiscal 2014, we incurred $0.2 million in financing costs with the first and second amendments. An additional $0.2 million in financing costs was paid during fiscal 2015 for the second and third amendments.\nNew Term Loan. We entered into a senior unsecured delayed-draw term facility (the new term loan\u201d) on April 5, 2013 with a commitment of up to $300.0 million. The company drew down the full amount of the new term loan on July 18, 2013 (the borrowing date\u201d).\nThe new term loan amortizes in quarterly installments based on an increasing annual percentage. The first payment was due and payable on the last business day of the first calendar quarter ending after the borrowing date, quarterly payments are due on the last business day of each successive calendar quarter and all remaining outstanding principal is due and payable on the fifth anniversary of the borrowing date. The table below presents the principal payment amounts remaining under the new term loan as of January 2, 2016 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 112,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn February 14, 2014, we entered into an amendment to the new term loan which was accounted for as a modification of the debt and favorably reduced the interest rates described below from those entered into originally on April 5, 2013. Voluntary prepayments on the new term loan may be made without premium or penalty. Interest is due quarterly in arrears on any outstanding borrowings at a customary Eurodollar rate or the base rate plus applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 0.00% to 1.25% for base rate loans and from 1.00% to 2.25% for Eurodollar loans, and is based on the company's leverage ratio. Interest on base rate loans is payable quarterly in arrears on the last business day of each calendar quarter. Interest on Eurodollar loans is payable in arrears at the end of the interest period and every three months in the case of interest periods in excess of three months. The company paid financing costs of $1.7 million in connection with the new term loan, which are being amortized over the life of the new term loan. A commitment fee of 20 basis points on the daily undrawn portion of the lenders' commitments commenced on May 1, 2013 and continued until the borrowing date, when the company borrowed the available $300.0 million for the acquisition of certain Hostess Brands, Inc. bread assets. The new term loan is subject to customary restrictive covenants, including certain limitations on liens and significant acquisitions and financial covenants regarding minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio. The February 14, 2014 amendment cost $0.3 million and is being amortized over the remaining term. As of January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, the company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants under the new term loan.\nSenior Notes. On April 3, 2012, the company issued $400.0 million of senior notes. The company pays semiannual interest on the notes on each April 1 and October 1, beginning on October 1, 2012, and the notes will mature on April 1, 2022. The notes bear\ninterest at 4.375% per annum. On any date prior to January 1, 2022, the company may redeem some or all of the notes at a price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed and (2) a make-whole\u201d amount plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. The make-whole amount is equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal thereof (not including any interest accrued thereon to, but not including, the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the treasury rate (as defined in the indenture governing the notes), plus 35 basis points, plus in each case, unpaid interest accrued thereon to, but not including, the date of redemption. At any time on or after January 1, 2022, the company may redeem some or all of the notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. If the company experiences a change of control triggering event\u201d (which involves a change of control of the company and related rating of the notes below investment grade), it is required to offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon unless the company exercised its option to redeem the notes in whole. The notes are also subject to customary restrictive covenants, including certain limitations on liens and sale and leaseback transactions.\nThe face value of the notes is $400.0 million and the current discount on the notes is $0.6 million. The company paid issuance costs (including underwriting fees and legal fees) for issuing the notes of $3.9 million. The issuance costs and the debt discount are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes. As of January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, the company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants under the indenture governing the notes.\nCredit Facility. On April 21, 2015, the company amended its senior unsecured credit facility (the credit facility\u201d) to extend the term to April 21, 2020, reduce the applicable margin on base rate and Eurodollar loans and reduce the facility fees, described below. The amendment was accounted for as a modification of the debt. The credit facility is a five-year, $500.0 million senior unsecured revolving loan facility. The credit facility contains a provision that permits Flowers to request up to $200.0 million in additional revolving commitments, for a total of up to $700.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Proceeds from the credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisition financing, refinancing of indebtedness, dividends and share repurchases. The credit facility includes certain customary restrictions, which, among other things, require maintenance of financial covenants and limit encumbrance of assets and creation of indebtedness. Restrictive financial covenants include such ratios as a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. The company believes that, given its current cash position, its cash flow from operating activities and its available credit capacity, it can comply with the current terms of the amended credit facility and can meet presently foreseeable financial requirements. As of January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, the company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants under the credit facility.\nInterest is due quarterly in arrears on any outstanding borrowings at a customary Eurodollar rate or the base rate plus applicable margin. The underlying rate is defined as rates offered in the interbank Eurodollar market, or the higher of the prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, with a floor rate defined by the one-month interbank Eurodollar market rate plus 1.00%. The applicable margin ranges from 0.0% to 0.50% for base rate loans and from 0.70% to 1.50% for Eurodollar loans. In addition, a facility fee ranging from 0.05% to 0.25% is due quarterly on all commitments under the credit facility. Both the interest margin and the facility fee are based on the company's leverage ratio. The company paid additional financing costs of $0.4 million in connection with the April 21, 2015 amendment of the credit facility, which, in addition to the remaining balance of the original $1.3 million in financing costs, is being amortized over the life of the credit facility. The company recognized $0.1 million in financing costs for the modification at the time of the April 21, 2015 amendment.\nAt January 2, 2016, there was $160.0 million outstanding under the credit facility. There were $53.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at January 3, 2015. The highest outstanding daily balance during fiscal 2015 was $160.0 million and the lowest outstanding balance was zero. Amounts outstanding under the credit facility vary daily. Changes in the gross borrowings and repayments can be caused by cash flow activity from operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases, and tax payments, as well as derivative transactions which are part of the company's overall risk management strategy as discussed in Note 9, Derivative Financial Instruments. During fiscal 2015, the company borrowed $820.0 million in revolving borrowings under the credit facility and repaid $713.0 million in revolving borrowings. The amount available under the credit facility is reduced by $16.9 million for letters of credit. On January 2, 2016, the company had $323.1 million available under its credit facility for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nCredit Ratings. Currently, the company's credit ratings by Fitch Ratings, Moody's Investors Service, and Standard & Poor's are BBB, Baa2, and BBB, respectively. Standard & Poor's upgraded the company from a BBB- credit rating on September 16, 2015. Changes in the company's credit ratings do not trigger a change in the company's available borrowings or costs under the facility, new term loan, senior notes, and credit facility, but could affect future credit availability and cost.\nAggregate Maturities of Debt.\nAssets recorded under capital lease agreements included in property, plant and equipment consist of machinery and equipment and transportation equipment.\nAggregate maturities of debt outstanding, including capital leases and the associated interest, as of January 2, 2016, are as follows (excluding unamortized debt discount and issuance costs) (amounts in thousands):\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 292,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 163,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2021 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 401,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,010,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock Repurchase Plan. Our Board of Directors approved a plan that authorized share repurchases of up to 67.5 million shares of the company's common stock. In November 2014, the Board increased the company's share repurchase authorization by 7.1 million shares to a total of 74.6 million shares. At the close of the company's fourth quarter on January 2, 2016, 13.7 million shares remained under the existing authorization. Under the plan, the company may repurchase its common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions or under an accelerated repurchase program at such times and at such prices as determined to be in the company's best interest. These purchases may be commenced or suspended without prior notice depending on then-existing business or market conditions and other factors. As of January 2, 2016, 60.9 million shares at a cost of $504.1 million have been purchased under this plan. Included in these amounts are 0.3 million shares at a cost of $6.9 million purchased during fiscal 2015.\nIncome Taxes. Federal and state tax payments totaled $87.6 million, $82.8 million, and $83.8 million during fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and were funded with cash flows from operations.\nDistributor Arrangements. The company offers long-term financing to independent distributors for the purchase of their distribution rights, and a vast majority of the independent distributors elect to use this financing alternative and a liability is established. These notes generally have terms of up to ten years and the independent distributor pays principal and interest weekly. A majority of the independent distributors have the right to require the company to repurchase the distribution rights and trucks, if applicable, at the original price paid by the independent distributor on the long-term financing arrangement in the six-month period following the sale of a distribution right to the independent distributor. If the truck is leased, the company will assume the lease payment (but not the lease) if the distribution rights are repurchased during the first six-month period. After the six-month period expires, the company retains a right of first refusal to repurchase these distribution rights. Additionally, in the event the company exits a geographic market or ceases to utilize the independent distribution form of doing business, the company is contractually required to purchase the distribution rights from the independent distributor. If the company acquires a distribution right from an independent distributor that is to be resold, the company operates the territory until it can be resold. If the distribution rights are not to be resold, the value of the distribution rights is charged to earnings. The company held an aggregate of $174.9 million and $182.2 million as of January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, respectively, of distribution rights notes receivable. The company does not view this aggregate amount as a concentrated credit risk, as each note relates to an individual independent distributor. The company has approximately $28.3 million and $20.5 million as of January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, respectively, of distribution rights held for sale.\nIn the ordinary course of business, when an independent distributor terminates the relationship with the company, the company, although not legally obligated, generally purchases and operates that territory utilizing the leased truck of the former independent distributor. To accomplish this, the company operates the leased truck for the independent distributor, who generally remains solely liable under the original truck lease to the third party lessor, and continues the payments on behalf of the former independent distributor. Once the territory is resold to an independent distributor, the truck lease is assumed by the new independent distributor. At January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2016, the company operated approximately 600 and 420 trucks as held for sale distributorships, respectively. Assuming the company does not resell these territories to a new independent distributor, at January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, the maximum contractual obligation associated with these truck leases was approximately $6.2 million and $8.1 million, respectively. There is no liability recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with respect to such leases, as the obligation for each lease is retained by the former independent distributor until the distribution rights to the territory are sold to a new independent distributor. The company does not anticipate operating these territories over the life of the lease as it intends to resell these territories to a new independent distributor.\nSpecial Purpose Entities. At January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, the company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which are established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nDeferred Compensation. The Executive Deferred Compensation Plan ( EDCP\u201d) consists of unsecured general obligations of the company to pay the deferred compensation of, and our contributions to, participants in the EDCP. The obligations will rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness payable from the company's general assets.\nThe company's directors and certain key members of management are eligible to participate in the EDCP. Directors may elect to defer all or any portion of their annual retainer fee and meeting fees. Deferral elections by directors must be made prior to the beginning of each year and are thereafter irrevocable. Eligible employees may elect to defer up to 75% of their base salaries, and up to 100% of any cash bonuses and other compensation through December 31, 2015. Effective January 1, 2016, employees may elect to defer up to 75% of their base salaries, any cash bonuses and other compensation. Deferral elections by eligible executives must be made prior to the beginning of each year and are thereafter irrevocable during that year. The portion of the participant's compensation that is deferred depends on the participant's election in effect with respect to his or her elective contributions under the EDCP. The amount outstanding at January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015 was $14.8 million and $14.5 million, respectively.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments. The following table summarizes the company's contractual obligations and commitments at January 2, 2016 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in the indicated future periods:\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amounts in thousands)\n</td>

Our company has provided various representations, warranties, and other standard indemnifications in various agreements with customers, suppliers and other parties, as well as in agreements to sell business assets or lease facilities. In general, these provisions indemnify the counterparty for matters such as breaches of representations and warranties, certain environmental conditions and tax matters, and, in the context of sales of business assets, any liabilities arising prior to the closing of the transactions. Non-performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the company. The ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of any potential claims. We do not believe that any of these commitments will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nSee Note 4, New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K regarding this information.\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to respond to this prompt using a list of bullet points.

Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data included herein and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. The following information contains forward-looking statements which involve certain risks and uncertainties. See Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this Form 10-K.\nOverview:\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is segregated into four sections, including:\n \u00b7 Business - discussion of our long-term strategic objectives, acquisitions, and the competitive environment. \n \u00b7 Critical accounting estimates - describes the accounting areas where management makes critical estimates to report our financial condition and results of operations. \n \u00b7 Results of operations - an analysis of the company's consolidated results of operations for the two comparative periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. \n \u00b7 Liquidity and capital resources - an analysis of cash flow, contractual obligations, and certain other matters affecting the company's financial position. \nThere were several significant events that will provide additional context while reading this discussion. Fiscal 2014 was a 53 week year while fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2013 were 52 week years. These events include:\n \u00b7 Further expansion into the organic bread market - As discussed below, we have recently completed two strategic acquisitions, Dave's Killer Bread and Alpine Valley Bread Company, which we believe strengthen our position in the fast growing organic bread market. \n \u00b7 Alpine Valley Bread Company acquisition - On October 13, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Alpine Valley Bread Company ( Alpine\u201d), a family-owned producer of certified organic and all-natural breads in the U.S., for approximately $121.9 million in cash and stock. Alpine has two production facilities in Mesa, Arizona and is included in our Warehouse Segment. The acquisition expands our penetration into the organic market and provides additional organic production capacity. We funded the cash portion of the purchase price for the Alpine acquisition with our existing credit facilities and also issued 481,540 shares of our common stock to fund the equity portion of the purchase price. \n \u00b7 Dave's Killer Bread acquisition - On September 12, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Dave's Killer Bread ( DKB\u201d) for total cash payments of approximately $282.1 million inclusive of payments for certain tax benefits. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination and is included in our DSD Segment. We believe the acquisition strengthens our position as the second-largest baker in the U.S. by giving us greater access to the fast growing organic bread category and expanding our geographic reach into the Pacific Northwest. DKB operates one production facility in Milwaukie, Oregon. We funded the purchase price of the DKB acquisition with cash on hand and borrowings from our existing credit facilities. \n \u00b7 Amendment to accounts receivable securitization facility - On August 20, 2015, we amended our accounts receivable securitization facility (the facility\u201d) to extend the term to August 11, 2017 and to add a leverage pricing grid. The amendment was accounted for as a modification. We drew down on the facility to fund the purchase price of the DKB acquisition. \n \u00b7 Plant closing - During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we closed our DSD Segment production facility located in Morristown, Tennessee and relocated this production to one of our other DSD Segment facilities located in Knoxville, Tennessee. Costs associated with the closure were $0.7 million and are included in our fiscal 2015 results of operations. \n \u00b7 Impairment of assets - During fiscal 2015 and 2014, we recorded impairment charges of $2.3 million and $5.8 million, respectively, on certain properties that are currently held for sale. Additionally, during fiscal 2015, we decided to close a production line at one of our DSD Segment bakeries and transition this production to another facility, recording an impairment loss of $1.5 million on the equipment we no longer intend to use. During the second quarter of 2014, we decided to sell certain assets at our Ft. Worth, Texas tortilla facility and recognized an impairment loss on goodwill of $2.6 million and an impairment loss of $1.9 million on assets to be scrapped. The sale was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. \n \u00b7 Amendment to the credit facility - On April 21, 2015, we amended our existing senior unsecured revolving loan facility (the credit facility\u201d). The amendment to the credit facility extended the term to April 21, 2020, reduced the applicable margin on base rate and Eurodollar loans and reduced the facility fees. \n \u00b7 Opening of Lenexa, Kansas bakery - During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we opened the bread line at our Lenexa bakery which was acquired as part of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets (defined below) in July 2013. We opened the bun line during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The bakery produces products for the Kansas, eastern Oklahoma, and Missouri markets under the Nature's Own, Wonder, and Home Pride brands. \n \u00b7 Roman Meal trademark acquisition - On February 25, 2015, we announced that we acquired the Roman Meal trademark from the Roman Meal Company in Tacoma, Washington. This trademark acquisition for breads and buns in the United States and its territories, and in Mexico, Canada, Bermuda, and the Bahamas is being accounted for as an asset purchase and is being amortized over 20 years. \n \u00b7 Revision of prior period sales - During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we revised net sales. Historically, certain immaterial discounts had been recorded as an expense to selling, distribution and administrative costs. These discounts are now recorded as contra revenue. These revisions were made for all periods presented in the fiscal 2014 Form 10-K. See Note 3, Financial Statement Revisions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for more details. \n \u00b7 Hostess acquired assets - On July 19, 2013, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Hostess Brands, Inc. ( Hostess\u201d), which included the Wonder, Nature's Pride, Merita, Home Pride and Butternut bread brands, 20 closed bakeries and 36 depots (the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets\u201d). Subsequent to the acquisition of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets, we determined that certain of these plants and depots do not fit into our long-term operating strategy, and we are actively marketing them for sale. Several of these plants and depots have already been sold and the remainder are classified as held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this Form 10-K. We expect these sales to continue into fiscal 2016. We received a total of $9.1 million during fiscal 2015 from the sale of these assets classified as held for sale. During fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, we recognized impairments of $2.0 million and $5.8 million, respectively, on certain of the plants and depots acquired as part of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets. Also, we recorded carrying costs associated with all the Acquired Hostess Bread Asset plants and depots not currently in operation of approximately $12.8 million, $19.5 million and $10.6 million during fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively. Carrying costs include workforce-related costs, property taxes, utilities and depreciation, among other costs. The carrying costs and impairment charges are included in our Consolidated Statements of Income. \nBusiness\nFlowers is focused on opportunities for growth within the baked foods category and seeks to have its products available wherever baked foods are consumed - whether in homes, restaurants, fast food outlets, institutions, or vending machines. The company has 49 operating bakeries in 18 states that produce a wide range of breads, buns, rolls, snack cakes, and tortillas.\nSegments and Delivery Methods\nThe company has two business segments that reflect its two distinct methods of delivering products to market. DSD Segment products are sold and delivered fresh to customers through a network of independent distributors who are incentivized to grow sales and to build equity in their distributorships. The DSD Segment reaches approximately 85% of the U.S. population with fresh bakery foods. The Warehouse Segment ships fresh and frozen products to customers' warehouses nationwide. Customers then distribute these products to their depots, stores, or restaurants. Flowers' bakeries fall into either the DSD Segment or Warehouse Segment depending on the primary method of delivery used to sell their products.\nThe DSD Segment operates a highly involved system of reciprocal baking whereby each bakery has an assigned production mission to produce certain items for its own market as well as for other DSD Segment bakeries' markets and the Warehouse Segment. This system allows for long and efficient production runs that help the company maintain its position as a low-cost producer. Bakeries within regional networks exchange products overnight through a third-party transportation system so that at the beginning of each sales day every DSD Segment bakery has a full complement of fresh products for the independent distributor to provide to retail and foodservice customers.\nThe company has invested significant capital in its bakeries for several decades to ensure its production is as efficient as possible, uses technology effectively, provides consistently excellent quality, and offers a good working environment for team members. In fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, the company had capital expenditures of $90.8 million, $83.8 million, and $99.2 million, respectively.\nConsumers and our product portfolio\nFlowers recognizes the need to stay in touch with changing consumer trends regarding baked foods. As a result, ongoing research on consumer preferences is conducted and outside resources are engaged to help ensure our bakery products remain on trend\nwith consumers' changing taste, texture, and flavor trends. Our marketing, quality assurance, and research and development teams collaborate regularly as new products are considered, developed, tested, and introduced.\nBrands are important in the bakery category and the company has invested over several decades in its brand portfolio through advertising, promotion, and packaging. Nature's Own, introduced in 1977, was developed to address the emerging trend of consumers demanding baked foods with a healthier profile. Nature's Own, from inception, has offered baked foods with no artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives.\nOn October 13, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Alpine and their product line of super premium organic and all-natural bread products. These products, which are warehouse delivered, are marketed under the Alpine Valley Bread brand and further extend our organic product line.\nOn September 12, 2015, we completed the DKB acquisition, which includes a full product line of super premium whole-grain 100% organic and non-GMO bakery products sold under the Dave's Killer Bread label, the leading organic bread brand in the U.S.\nOn July 19, 2013, we completed the acquisition of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets, which included the Wonder, Merita, Home Pride and Butternut brands. These brands were taken off the market when Hostess ceased operations in November 2012. Late in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we began re-introducing these brands to the marketplace within our DSD Segment. We plan to continue to re-introduce these brands as we expand into new markets.\nSnack cakes have been part of the company's product offerings since at least the early 1920s. In more recent years, snack cakes have been developed and introduced under several brands, such as Blue Bird and Mrs. Freshley's. In 2011, the company acquired Tasty Baking Co. ( Tasty\u201d) and its extensive line of Tastykake branded snack cakes. Since the acquisition of Tasty, we have expanded the distribution of the Tastykake products throughout our territories and expect to continue this expansion.\nIn 2014, we re-branded the Cobblestone Mill brand to the Cobblestone Bread Company brand. There were twelve core products and other regional favorites at introduction. This brand includes restaurant and sandwich shop inspired breads and rolls. We completed the roll-out to the full market in July 2014.\nStrengths and core competencies\nWe aim to achieve consistent and sustainable growth in sales and earnings by focusing on improvements in the operating results of our existing bakeries and, after detailed analysis, acquiring companies and properties that add value to the company. We believe this strategy has resulted in consistent and sustainable growth that will continue to build value for our shareholders.\nThe company is also committed to maintaining a collaborative, in-house information technology team, as well as certain outsourced services, that meets all of our bakeries' needs and maximizes efficiencies. The consumer packaged goods industry has used PBS over several years to share information between the supplier and retailer. An extension of this technology allows the retailer to pay the supplier when the consumer purchases the goods rather than at the time they are delivered to the retailer. In addition, PBS permits the manufacturer to more accurately track trends in product sales and manage inventory. In fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, the company recorded $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively, in sales through PBS.\nWe regularly articulate our core business strategies to the investment community and internally to our team members, including long-term (five-year) goals. Compensation and bonus programs are linked to the company's short and long-term goals. The majority of our employees participate in an annual formula-driven, performance-based cash bonus program. In addition, certain employees participate in a long-term incentive program that provides performance-contingent common stock awards that generally vest over a two-year period. We believe these incentive programs provide both a short and long-term goal for our most senior management team and aligns their interests with those of our shareholders.\nWe believe our highly automated bakeries, with teams that focus on quality, bake products that meet consumers' needs. We strive to maintain and exceed service levels for our customers, consumers, and suppliers. The design of our delivery systems and segments permits us to allocate management time and resources to meet marketplace expectations.\nCompetition and risks\nHostess' liquidation in late November 2012 impacted the industry as Hostess sales shifted to other providers to meet marketplace needs. These providers included Flowers, Grupo Bimbo (with Sara Lee, Arnolds, Thomas, and Entenmann's brands), Campbell Soup Company (with the Pepperidge Farm brand), McKee Foods Corporation (Little Debbie) and smaller regional bakeries, retailer-owned bakeries, and store brands. Certain Hostess cake products were re-introduced into the market in July 2013 by a new and\nseparate company, Hostess Brands, LLC ( Hostess LLC\u201d), formed by the outside investment group of Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulous & Co.\nSales are principally affected by pricing, quality, brand recognition, new product introductions, product line extensions, marketing, and service. Sales for fiscal 2015 increased 0.8% as compared to fiscal 2014. This change was due to both volume increases and the DKB and Alpine acquisition contribution, partially offset by the lack of a 53rd week in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nCommodities, such as our baking ingredients, periodically experience price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments in an effort to manage the impact of such volatility in raw material prices. Any decrease in the availability of these agreements and instruments could increase the effective price of these raw materials to us and significantly affect our earnings.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nNote 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe company's discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues, expenses, and cash flows during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer programs and incentives, bad debts, raw materials, inventories, long-lived assets, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, and contingencies and litigation. The company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe selection and disclosure of the company's critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the company's audit committee. The following, in no particular order of importance, is a review of the critical assumptions and estimates, and the accounting policies and methods listed below, which are used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements:\n \u00b7 revenue recognition; \n \u00b7 derivative instruments; \n \u00b7 valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets; \n \u00b7 self-insurance reserves; \n \u00b7 income tax expense and accruals; \n \u00b7 pension obligations; \n \u00b7 stock-based compensation; and \n \u00b7 commitments and contingencies. \nRevenue Recognition. The company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products at the time of delivery when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The company records both direct and estimated reductions to gross revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings at the time the incentive is offered or at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying transaction that results in progress by the customer towards earning the incentive. These allowances include price promotion discounts, coupons, customer rebates, cooperative advertising, and product returns. Price promotion discount expense is recorded as a reduction to gross sales when the discounted product is sold to the customer. If market conditions were to decline, the company may take actions to increase incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue.\nThe consumer packaged goods industry has used scan-based trading technology over several years to share information between the supplier and retailer. An extension of this technology allows the retailer to pay the supplier when the consumer purchases the goods rather than at the time they are delivered to the retailer. Consequently, revenue on these sales is not recognized until the product is purchased by the consumer. This technology is referred to as PBS. The company began a pilot program in fiscal 1999, working with\ncertain retailers to develop the technology to execute PBS, and there has been a sharp increase in its use since that time. In fiscal 2015, the company recorded $1.2 billion in sales through PBS. The company will continue to implement PBS technology for current PBS customers as they open new retail stores during 2016. In addition, new PBS customers will begin implementation during 2016. Revenue on PBS sales is recognized when the product is purchased by the end consumer because that is when title and risk of loss is transferred. Non-PBS sales are recognized when the product is delivered to the customer since that is when title and risk of loss is transferred.\nDerivative Instruments. The company's cost of primary raw materials is highly correlated to certain commodities markets. Commodities, such as our baking ingredients, experience price fluctuations. If actual market conditions become significantly different than those anticipated, raw material prices could increase significantly, adversely affecting our results of operations. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting to manage the impact of volatility in raw material prices. The company measures the fair value of its derivative portfolio using fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal market for that asset or liability. When quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities are not available, the company bases fair value on internally developed models that use current market observable inputs, such as exchange-quoted futures prices and yield curves.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The company records an impairment charge to property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting standards when, based on certain indicators of impairment, it believes such assets have experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of these underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset that may not be reflected in the asset's current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future. As discussed above, during fiscal 2015, we decided to close a production line at one of our bakeries and transition this production to another facility. We recognized an impairment loss of $1.5 million on the equipment we no longer intend to use. Based on management's evaluation, no impairment charges relating to long-lived held and used assets were recorded for fiscal years 2014 or 2013.\nThe company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its goodwill on an annual basis or at a time when events occur that indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may be impaired using a two-step process. We have elected not to perform the qualitative approach. The first step of this evaluation is performed by calculating the fair value of the business segment, or reporting unit, with which the goodwill is associated. Our reporting units are at the segment level. Each segment consists of several components. These components are aggregated by their respective delivery method into the Warehouse Segment and DSD Segment. These segments rely on reciprocal baking among their components, cross-sells their products/brands within the segment, and utilize the same delivery method. Marketing, research and development and capital projects are measured at the segment level. We believe these factors support our reporting unit classifications. This fair value is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, and if less than the carrying value, the goodwill is evaluated for potential impairment under step two. Under step two of this calculation, goodwill is measured for potential impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, determined in the same manner as a business combination, with the carrying amount of the goodwill.\nOur annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires management judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting units. Fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodologies incorporating market participant considerations and management's assumptions on revenue, revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, and EBITDA (defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). Our estimates can significantly affect the outcome of the test. We perform the fair value assessment using the income and market approach. We use this data to complete a separate fair value analysis for each reporting unit. Changes in our forecasted operating results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates. This test is performed in our fourth quarter unless circumstances require this analysis to be completed sooner. The income approach is tested using a sensitivity analysis to changes in the discount rate and yield a sufficient buffer to significant variances in our estimates. The estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded our carrying values in excess of $700 million in each reporting unit in fiscal 2015. Based on management's evaluation, other than the $2.6 million impairment loss related to our Ft. Worth, Texas tortilla facility discussed above, no other impairment charges relating to goodwill were recorded for the fiscal years 2015, 2014, or 2013.\nIn connection with acquisitions, the company has acquired trademarks, customer lists, and non-compete agreements, a portion of which are amortizable. The company evaluates these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The undiscounted future cash flows of each intangible asset is compared to the carrying amount, and if less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. The fair value is computed using the same approach described above for goodwill and includes the same risks and estimates. The fair value of the trademarks could be less than our carrying value if any of our four material assumptions in our fair value analysis: (a) weighted average cost of capital; (b) long-term sales growth rates; (c) forecasted operating margins; and (d) market multiples do not meet our expectations, thereby requiring us to record an asset impairment. We use the multi-period excess earnings and relief from royalty methods to value these intangibles. The method used for impairment testing purposes is consistent with the\nvaluation method employed at acquisition of the intangible asset. Based on management's evaluation, no impairment charges relating to amortizable intangible assets were recorded for the fiscal years 2015, 2014, or 2013.\nThe company also owns $414.0 million of trademarks acquired in acquisitions that are indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization. A total of $144.0 million of the trademarks were from the Lepage acquisition that occurred in July 2012. A total of $79.5 million and $189.0 million of the trademarks were from the Sara Lee California and the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets acquisitions, respectively, both completed in fiscal 2013. The company evaluates the recoverability by comparing the fair value to the carrying value of these intangible assets on an annual basis or at a time when events occur that indicate the carrying value may be impaired. In addition, the assets are evaluated to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite life. The fair value is compared to the carrying value of the intangible asset, and if less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to fair value. During fiscal 2015, in conjunction with the DKB and Alpine acquisitions, we determined that the Barowsky's trademark acquired in the Lepage acquisition would be used on a more regional basis as an organic brand rather than distributed nationally, and therefore is deemed to have a finite life. We began amortizing this trademark in fiscal 2015.\nThere are certain inherent risks included in our expectations about the performance of acquired trademarks and brands. If we are unable to implement our growth strategies for these acquired intangible assets as expected, it could adversely impact the carrying value of the brands. The fair value of the trademarks could be less than our carrying value if any of our four material assumptions in our fair value analysis: (a) weighted average cost of capital; (b) long-term sales growth rates; (c) forecasted operating margins; and (d) market multiples do not meet our expectations, thereby requiring us to record an asset impairment. There were no impairments recorded on intangible assets not subject to amortization for the fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nThe impairment analysis on the indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization is very sensitive to the long-term growth rates of the brand. The brands acquired in the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets have been valued based on our expectation of the timing reintroducing the brands. The company is also continually analyzing these brands to determine the expansion markets in which they will be introduced. If the timing of our expansion does not proceed as we currently anticipate, these brands could become impaired.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves. We are self-insured for various levels of general liability, auto liability, workers' compensation, and employee medical and dental coverage. Insurance reserves are calculated on an undiscounted basis and are based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed utilizing historical claim trends. Projected settlements and incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on pending claims and historical trends and data. Though the company does not expect them to do so, actual settlements and claims could differ materially from those estimated. Material differences in actual settlements and claims could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncome Tax Expense and Accruals. The annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in statutory rates and tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material effect on the annual tax rate. The effect of these changes, if any, would be recognized when the change takes place.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserve for uncertain tax benefits reflect our best assessment of future taxes to be paid in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if we believe it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance, which could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.\nPeriodically, we face audits from federal and state tax authorities, which can result in challenges regarding the timing and amount of income or deductions. We provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it more likely than not that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these reserves on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements that may impact the ultimate payment of such potential exposures. While the ultimate outcome of audits cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently believe that current or future audits will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The company is no longer subject to federal examination for years prior to fiscal 2012 and is currently under audit for fiscal years 2012 through 2014.\nPension Obligations. The company records pension costs and benefit obligations related to its defined benefit plans based on actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect key assumptions determined by management, including the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and mortality. Material changes in pension costs and in benefit obligations may occur in the future due to experience that is different than assumed and changes in these assumptions.\nEffective January 1, 2006, the company curtailed its largest defined benefit plan (Plan No. 1) that covered the majority of its workforce. Benefits under this plan are frozen, and no future benefits will accrue under this plan. The company assumed sponsorship of two defined benefit plans as part of the ButterKrust acquisition (2008) and a qualified defined benefit plan as part of the Tasty acquisition (2011); benefits under these plans are frozen, and no future benefits will accrue under these plans. The ButterKrust plans and the Tasty plan were merged into Plan No. 1 effective December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012, respectively. In addition to Plan No. 1, the company sponsors an ongoing defined benefit pension plan for union employees (Plan No. 2) and a frozen nonqualified plan covering former Tasty executives.\nThe company recorded pension income of $6.0 million on our qualified defined benefit plans for fiscal 2015. We recorded pension cost of $5.6 million for fiscal 2014 (inclusive of a $15.4 million settlement charge for lump sums paid in the fourth quarter of 2014). We expect pension income of approximately $6.2 million on our qualified defined benefit plans for fiscal 2016.\nIn September 2014, the company announced a one-time voluntary lump sum offer to approximately 2,500 former employees in Plan No. 1 and 2 who had not yet started receiving monthly payments of their vested benefits. The offer supported the company's pension risk management strategy and reduced plan obligations by 10%. Distributions of $50.4 million in lump sums from existing plan assets for Plan 1 and Plan 2 in December 2014 resulted in a settlement charge of $15.4 million for Plan No. 1 only. No settlement charge was required for Plan No. 2 as the distributions were not in excess of service costs and interest costs for fiscal 2014.\nOn January 1, 2016, the company began providing pension plan participants who have not yet started their payments the option to receive their benefit as a single lump sum payment. Participants can elect this option when they retire or when they leave the company. This change supports our long-term pension risk management strategy. The amount of the lump sum payments may trigger a settlement charge in fiscal 2016 but at this time we are not able to estimate the possible impact, if any.\nIn 2016, we will refine the method used to estimate service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs. Historically, we estimated the service cost and interest cost components using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. Going forward, we will use a spot rate approach to estimate these components of benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows, as we believe this provides a better estimate of service and interest costs. We consider this a change in estimate and accordingly, will account for it prospectively starting in 2016. This change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligation.\nIn developing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at each measurement date, the company considers the plan assets' historical actual returns, targeted asset allocations, and the anticipated future economic environment and long-term performance of individual asset classes, based on the company's investment strategy. While appropriate consideration is given to recent and historical investment performance, the assumption represents management's best estimate of the long-term prospective return. Based on these factors, the long-term rate of return assumption for the plans was set at 8.0% for fiscal 2015, as compared with the average annual return on the plans' assets over the past 15 years of approximately 6.9% (net of expenses). The plan has an average annual rate of return since inception in 1987 of 9.1% (net of expenses). The expected long-term rate of return assumption is based on a target asset allocation of 40-60% equity securities, 10-40% fixed income securities, 0-25% real estate, 0-40% other diversifying strategies (including, absolute return funds, hedged equity funds, and guaranteed insurance contracts), and 0-25% short-term investments and cash. The company regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the plan assets to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Pension costs do not include an explicit expense assumption and the return on assets rate reflects the long-term expected return, net of expenses. For the details of our pension plan assets, see Note 19, Postretirement Plans, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nThe company utilizes the Society of Actuaries' ( SOA\u201d) published mortality tables and improvement scales in developing their best estimates of mortality. In October 2014, the SOA published final reports on their standard\u201d mortality table ( RP-2014\u201d) and mortality improvement scale ( MP-2014\u201d). In October 2015, the SOA published a revised mortality improvement scale ( MP-2015\u201d). Based on an evaluation of the information released in 2015, the Company updated the mortality assumptions for purposes of measuring pension benefit obligations at year-end 2015. The Company will continue to use the standard mortality tables and mortality improvement scale with adjustments to the base table as applicable: 15% adjustment for Plan No. 1 and blue collar adjustment for Plan No. 2. The change to the mortality assumption decreased the year-end pension benefit obligations by $6.3 million.\nThe company determines the fair value of substantially all of its plans' assets utilizing market quotes rather than developing smoothed\u201d values, market related\u201d values, or other modeling techniques. Plan asset gains or losses in a given year are included with other actuarial gains and losses due to remeasurement of the plans' projected benefit obligations ( PBO\u201d). If the total unrecognized gain or loss exceeds 10% of the larger of (i) the PBO or (ii) the market value of plan assets, the excess of the total unrecognized gain or loss is amortized over the expected average future lifetime of participants in the frozen pension plans. The total unrecognized loss as of December 31, 2015 for the pension plans the company sponsors is $144.1 million. The company uses a calendar year end for the measurement date since the plans are based on a calendar year and because it approximates the company's fiscal year end.\nAmortization of this unrecognized loss during fiscal 2016 is expected to be approximately $6.2 million. To the extent that this unrecognized loss is subsequently recognized, the loss will increase the company's pension costs in the future.\nA sensitivity analysis of fiscal 2015 pension costs on a pre-tax basis and year-end benefit obligations for our qualified plans is presented in the table below (amounts in thousands) to changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets ( EROA\u201d):\n\nStock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted is determined based on the grant date fair value. The company recognizes these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate, and recognizes compensation cost only for those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term of the share-based payment award.\nEmployee grants issued before fiscal 2012 included non-qualified stock options ( NQSOs\u201d) and performance-contingent stock awards ( PSAs\u201d). The NQSOs were valued using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The inputs for the model include an expected life, risk-free rate, expected volatility, and dividend yield. The PSAs incorporated a market and performance condition component. However, because of the market condition the expense amount would only change if we determined the performance condition was triggered. The performance condition was always satisfied and adjustments were never made. The market condition was dependent on certain market benchmarks but the expense for these awards never changed.\nIn fiscal 2013, 2014, and 2015, we granted PSAs that separately have a market and performance condition. The expense computed for the total shareholder return shares ( TSR\u201d) is fixed and recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The expense computed for the return on invested capital ( ROIC\u201d) shares can change depending on the attainment of performance condition goals. The expense for the ROIC shares can be within a range of 0% to 125% of the target. There is a possibility that this expense component will change in subsequent quarters depending on how the company performs relative to the ROIC target. The payouts for the TSR and ROIC shares to be issued in fiscal 2016 (on the 2014 awards) are estimated to be 27% and 96%, respectively.\nOur Chief Executive Officer ( CEO\u201d) received a time-based restricted stock award of approximately $1.3 million in 2013, which will vest 100% on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant provided the CEO remains employed by the company during this time. This award is being expensed on a straight line basis over the four year vesting period.\nCommitments and contingencies. The company and its subsidiaries from time to time are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including personal injury, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, product liability, health and safety and employment matters, including lawsuits related to the independent distributors, which are being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. While the company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it believes, based upon currently available facts, that it is remote that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its overall financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future. However, adverse developments could negatively impact earnings in a particular future fiscal period.\nResults of Operations\nMatters Affecting Analysis\nFiscal 2014 Week 53. The sales impact in our Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal 2014 week 53 was $63.2 million. The DSD Segment and Warehouse Segment impact was $53.4 million and $9.8 million, respectively. The impact to fiscal 2014 earnings per share was $0.01 per share.\nReporting Periods. The company operates on a 52-53 week fiscal year ending the Saturday nearest December 31. Fiscal 2014 consisted of 53 weeks. Fiscal 2015 and 2013 consisted of 52 weeks.\nRevision of prior period sales and Impairment of Assets. Refer to the Overview\u201d section above for a description of each of these items. Acquisitions are described below.\nAlpine Valley Bread acquisition (2015)\nOn October 13, 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Alpine Valley Bread Company, a family-owned producer of certified organic and all natural breads in the U.S. The acquisition expands our penetration into the organic market and provides additional organic production capacity.\nDave's Killer Bread acquisition (2015)\nOn September 12, 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Dave's Killer Bread, the nation's best-selling organic bread. We believe the acquisition of DKB strengthens our position as the second-largest baker in the U.S. by giving us access to the fast growing organic bread category and expanding our geographic reach into the Pacific Northwest.\nModesto, California acquisition (2013)\nOn July 27, 2013, the company completed the acquisition of certain assets related to a bun line in Modesto, California that now serves the California market for a total cash payment of $10.3 million. This acquisition is included in our DSD Segment and the total goodwill for this acquisition was $4.2 million.\nHostess Bread assets acquisition (2013)\nOn July 19, 2013, the company completed the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets acquisition for a total cash payment of $355.3 million. We continue to incur carrying costs on the acquired properties and depots not currently in operation and in fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, these costs were $12.8 million, $19.5 million and $10.6 million, respectively. These costs include workforce-related costs, property taxes, utilities, and depreciation, among other costs and were primarily included in the materials, supplies, labor, and other production costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately) line item in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. We began re-introducing the brands associated with the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets to the marketplace in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.\nSara Lee California acquisition (2013)\nOn February 23, 2013, the company completed its acquisition of certain assets and trademark licenses from BBU, Inc., a subsidiary of Grupo Bimbo, SAB de CV ( BBU\u201d), for a total cash payment of $50.0 million. The company acquired from BBU in the acquisition: (1) perpetual, exclusive, and royalty-free licenses to the Sara Lee and Earthgrains brands for sliced breads, buns, and rolls in the state of California and (2) a closed bakery in Stockton, California. In addition, we received a perpetual, exclusive, and royalty-free license to the Earthgrains brand for a broad range of fresh bakery products in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma market area. We financed this acquisition with cash on hand and debt. We believe the California acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase because the Department of Justice (the DOJ\u201d) required BBU to divest these assets, which resulted in a more favorable price to us than would have normally resulted from a typical arms-length negotiation. Accordingly, the fair value of the assets acquired exceeded the consideration paid by approximately $50.1 million after tax. The company agreed to a $10.0 million escrow holdback provision as a part of the Sara Lee California acquisition of which the company received $7.5 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The escrow holdback is described in more detail in Note 8, Acquisitions, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nThe company's results of operations, expressed as a percentage of sales, are set forth below for fiscal 2015 and 2014 (by segment):\n\n 1.

and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data included herein and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. The following information contains forward-looking statements which involve certain risks and uncertainties. See Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this Form 10-K.\nOverview:\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is segregated into four sections, including:\n \u00b7 Business - discussion of our long-term strategic objectives, acquisitions, and the competitive environment. \n \u00b7 Critical accounting estimates - describes the accounting areas where management makes critical estimates to report our financial condition and results of operations. \n \u00b7 Results of operations - an analysis of the company's consolidated results of operations for the two comparative periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. \n \u00b7 Liquidity and capital resources - an analysis of cash flow, contractual obligations, and certain other matters affecting the company's financial position. \nThere were several significant events that will provide additional context while reading this discussion. Fiscal 2014 was a 53 week year while fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2013 were 52 week years. These events include:\n \u00b7 Further expansion into the organic bread market - As discussed below, we have recently completed two strategic acquisitions, Dave's Killer Bread and Alpine Valley Bread Company, which we believe strengthen our position in the fast growing organic bread market. \n \u00b7 Alpine Valley Bread Company acquisition - On October 13, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Alpine Valley Bread Company ( Alpine\u201d), a family-owned producer of certified organic and all-natural breads in the U.S., for approximately $121.9 million in cash and stock. Alpine has two production facilities in Mesa, Arizona and is included in our Warehouse Segment. The acquisition expands our penetration into the organic market and provides additional organic production capacity. We funded the cash portion of the purchase price for the Alpine acquisition with our existing credit facilities and also issued 481,540 shares of our common stock to fund the equity portion of the purchase price. \n \u00b7 Dave's Killer Bread acquisition - On September 12, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Dave's Killer Bread ( DKB\u201d) for total cash payments of approximately $282.1 million inclusive of payments for certain tax benefits. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination and is included in our DSD Segment. We believe the acquisition strengthens our position as the second-largest baker in the U.S. by giving us greater access to the fast growing organic bread category and expanding our geographic reach into the Pacific Northwest. DKB operates one production facility in Milwaukie, Oregon. We funded the purchase price of the DKB acquisition with cash on hand and borrowings from our existing credit facilities. \n \u00b7 Amendment to accounts receivable securitization facility - On August 20, 2015, we amended our accounts receivable securitization facility (the facility\u201d) to extend the term to August 11, 2017 and to add a leverage pricing grid. The amendment was accounted for as a modification. We drew down on the facility to fund the purchase price of the DKB acquisition. \n \u00b7 Plant closing - During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we closed our DSD Segment production facility located in Morristown, Tennessee and relocated this production to one of our other DSD Segment facilities located in Knoxville, Tennessee. Costs associated with the closure were $0.7 million and are included in our fiscal 2015 results of operations. \n \u00b7 Impairment of assets - During fiscal 2015 and 2014, we recorded impairment charges of $2.3 million and $5.8 million, respectively, on certain properties that are currently held for sale. Additionally, during fiscal 2015, we decided to close a production line at one of our DSD Segment bakeries and transition this production to another facility, recording an impairment loss of $1.5 million on the equipment we no longer intend to use. During the second quarter of 2014, we decided to sell certain assets at our Ft. Worth, Texas tortilla facility and recognized an impairment loss on goodwill of $2.6 million and an impairment loss of $1.9 million on assets to be scrapped. The sale was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. \n \u00b7 Amendment to the credit facility - On April 21, 2015, we amended our existing senior unsecured revolving loan facility (the credit facility\u201d). The amendment to the credit facility extended the term to April 21, 2020, reduced the applicable margin on base rate and Eurodollar loans and reduced the facility fees. \n \u00b7 Opening of Lenexa, Kansas bakery - During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we opened the bread line at our Lenexa bakery which was acquired as part of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets (defined below) in July 2013. We opened the bun line during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The bakery produces products for the Kansas, eastern Oklahoma, and Missouri markets under the Nature's Own, Wonder, and Home Pride brands. \n \u00b7 Roman Meal trademark acquisition - On February 25, 2015, we announced that we acquired the Roman Meal trademark from the Roman Meal Company in Tacoma, Washington. This trademark acquisition for breads and buns in the United States and its territories, and in Mexico, Canada, Bermuda, and the Bahamas is being accounted for as an asset purchase and is being amortized over 20 years. \n \u00b7 Revision of prior period sales - During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we revised net sales. Historically, certain immaterial discounts had been recorded as an expense to selling, distribution and administrative costs. These discounts are now recorded as contra revenue. These revisions were made for all periods presented in the fiscal 2014 Form 10-K. See Note 3, Financial Statement Revisions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for more details. \n \u00b7 Hostess acquired assets - On July 19, 2013, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Hostess Brands, Inc. ( Hostess\u201d), which included the Wonder, Nature's Pride, Merita, Home Pride and Butternut bread brands, 20 closed bakeries and 36 depots (the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets\u201d). Subsequent to the acquisition of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets, we determined that certain of these plants and depots do not fit into our long-term operating strategy, and we are actively marketing them for sale. Several of these plants and depots have already been sold and the remainder are classified as held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this Form 10-K. We expect these sales to continue into fiscal 2016. We received a total of $9.1 million during fiscal 2015 from the sale of these assets classified as held for sale. During fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, we recognized impairments of $2.0 million and $5.8 million, respectively, on certain of the plants and depots acquired as part of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets. Also, we recorded carrying costs associated with all the Acquired Hostess Bread Asset plants and depots not currently in operation of approximately $12.8 million, $19.5 million and $10.6 million during fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively. Carrying costs include workforce-related costs, property taxes, utilities and depreciation, among other costs. The carrying costs and impairment charges are included in our Consolidated Statements of Income. \nBusiness\nFlowers is focused on opportunities for growth within the baked foods category and seeks to have its products available wherever baked foods are consumed - whether in homes, restaurants, fast food outlets, institutions, or vending machines. The company has 49 operating bakeries in 18 states that produce a wide range of breads, buns, rolls, snack cakes, and tortillas.\nSegments and Delivery Methods\nThe company has two business segments that reflect its two distinct methods of delivering products to market. DSD Segment products are sold and delivered fresh to customers through a network of independent distributors who are incentivized to grow sales and to build equity in their distributorships. The DSD Segment reaches approximately 85% of the U.S. population with fresh bakery foods. The Warehouse Segment ships fresh and frozen products to customers' warehouses nationwide. Customers then distribute these products to their depots, stores, or restaurants. Flowers' bakeries fall into either the DSD Segment or Warehouse Segment depending on the primary method of delivery used to sell their products.\nThe DSD Segment operates a highly involved system of reciprocal baking whereby each bakery has an assigned production mission to produce certain items for its own market as well as for other DSD Segment bakeries' markets and the Warehouse Segment. This system allows for long and efficient production runs that help the company maintain its position as a low-cost producer. Bakeries within regional networks exchange products overnight through a third-party transportation system so that at the beginning of each sales day every DSD Segment bakery has a full complement of fresh products for the independent distributor to provide to retail and foodservice customers.\nThe company has invested significant capital in its bakeries for several decades to ensure its production is as efficient as possible, uses technology effectively, provides consistently excellent quality, and offers a good working environment for team members. In fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, the company had capital expenditures of $90.8 million, $83.8 million, and $99.2 million, respectively.\nConsumers and our product portfolio\nFlowers recognizes the need to stay in touch with changing consumer trends regarding baked foods. As a result, ongoing research on consumer preferences is conducted and outside resources are engaged to help ensure our bakery products remain on trend\nwith consumers' changing taste, texture, and flavor trends. Our marketing, quality assurance, and research and development teams collaborate regularly as new products are considered, developed, tested, and introduced.\nBrands are important in the bakery category and the company has invested over several decades in its brand portfolio through advertising, promotion, and packaging. Nature's Own, introduced in 1977, was developed to address the emerging trend of consumers demanding baked foods with a healthier profile. Nature's Own, from inception, has offered baked foods with no artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives.\nOn October 13, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Alpine and their product line of super premium organic and all-natural bread products. These products, which are warehouse delivered, are marketed under the Alpine Valley Bread brand and further extend our organic product line.\nOn September 12, 2015, we completed the DKB acquisition, which includes a full product line of super premium whole-grain 100% organic and non-GMO bakery products sold under the Dave's Killer Bread label, the leading organic bread brand in the U.S.\nOn July 19, 2013, we completed the acquisition of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets, which included the Wonder, Merita, Home Pride and Butternut brands. These brands were taken off the market when Hostess ceased operations in November 2012. Late in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we began re-introducing these brands to the marketplace within our DSD Segment. We plan to continue to re-introduce these brands as we expand into new markets.\nSnack cakes have been part of the company's product offerings since at least the early 1920s. In more recent years, snack cakes have been developed and introduced under several brands, such as Blue Bird and Mrs. Freshley's. In 2011, the company acquired Tasty Baking Co. ( Tasty\u201d) and its extensive line of Tastykake branded snack cakes. Since the acquisition of Tasty, we have expanded the distribution of the Tastykake products throughout our territories and expect to continue this expansion.\nIn 2014, we re-branded the Cobblestone Mill brand to the Cobblestone Bread Company brand. There were twelve core products and other regional favorites at introduction. This brand includes restaurant and sandwich shop inspired breads and rolls. We completed the roll-out to the full market in July 2014.\nStrengths and core competencies\nWe aim to achieve consistent and sustainable growth in sales and earnings by focusing on improvements in the operating results of our existing bakeries and, after detailed analysis, acquiring companies and properties that add value to the company. We believe this strategy has resulted in consistent and sustainable growth that will continue to build value for our shareholders.\nThe company is also committed to maintaining a collaborative, in-house information technology team, as well as certain outsourced services, that meets all of our bakeries' needs and maximizes efficiencies. The consumer packaged goods industry has used PBS over several years to share information between the supplier and retailer. An extension of this technology allows the retailer to pay the supplier when the consumer purchases the goods rather than at the time they are delivered to the retailer. In addition, PBS permits the manufacturer to more accurately track trends in product sales and manage inventory. In fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, the company recorded $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively, in sales through PBS.\nWe regularly articulate our core business strategies to the investment community and internally to our team members, including long-term (five-year) goals. Compensation and bonus programs are linked to the company's short and long-term goals. The majority of our employees participate in an annual formula-driven, performance-based cash bonus program. In addition, certain employees participate in a long-term incentive program that provides performance-contingent common stock awards that generally vest over a two-year period. We believe these incentive programs provide both a short and long-term goal for our most senior management team and aligns their interests with those of our shareholders.\nWe believe our highly automated bakeries, with teams that focus on quality, bake products that meet consumers' needs. We strive to maintain and exceed service levels for our customers, consumers, and suppliers. The design of our delivery systems and segments permits us to allocate management time and resources to meet marketplace expectations.\nCompetition and risks\nHostess' liquidation in late November 2012 impacted the industry as Hostess sales shifted to other providers to meet marketplace needs. These providers included Flowers, Grupo Bimbo (with Sara Lee, Arnolds, Thomas, and Entenmann's brands), Campbell Soup Company (with the Pepperidge Farm brand), McKee Foods Corporation (Little Debbie) and smaller regional bakeries, retailer-owned bakeries, and store brands. Certain Hostess cake products were re-introduced into the market in July 2013 by a new and\nseparate company, Hostess Brands, LLC ( Hostess LLC\u201d), formed by the outside investment group of Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulous & Co.\nSales are principally affected by pricing, quality, brand recognition, new product introductions, product line extensions, marketing, and service. Sales for fiscal 2015 increased 0.8% as compared to fiscal 2014. This change was due to both volume increases and the DKB and Alpine acquisition contribution, partially offset by the lack of a 53rd week in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nCommodities, such as our baking ingredients, periodically experience price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments in an effort to manage the impact of such volatility in raw material prices. Any decrease in the availability of these agreements and instruments could increase the effective price of these raw materials to us and significantly affect our earnings.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nNote 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe company's discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues, expenses, and cash flows during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer programs and incentives, bad debts, raw materials, inventories, long-lived assets, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, and contingencies and litigation. The company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe selection and disclosure of the company's critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the company's audit committee. The following, in no particular order of importance, is a review of the critical assumptions and estimates, and the accounting policies and methods listed below, which are used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements:\n \u00b7 revenue recognition; \n \u00b7 derivative instruments; \n \u00b7 valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets; \n \u00b7 self-insurance reserves; \n \u00b7 income tax expense and accruals; \n \u00b7 pension obligations; \n \u00b7 stock-based compensation; and \n \u00b7 commitments and contingencies. \nRevenue Recognition. The company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products at the time of delivery when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The company records both direct and estimated reductions to gross revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings at the time the incentive is offered or at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying transaction that results in progress by the customer towards earning the incentive. These allowances include price promotion discounts, coupons, customer rebates, cooperative advertising, and product returns. Price promotion discount expense is recorded as a reduction to gross sales when the discounted product is sold to the customer. If market conditions were to decline, the company may take actions to increase incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue.\nThe consumer packaged goods industry has used scan-based trading technology over several years to share information between the supplier and retailer. An extension of this technology allows the retailer to pay the supplier when the consumer purchases the goods rather than at the time they are delivered to the retailer. Consequently, revenue on these sales is not recognized until the product is purchased by the consumer. This technology is referred to as PBS. The company began a pilot program in fiscal 1999, working with\ncertain retailers to develop the technology to execute PBS, and there has been a sharp increase in its use since that time. In fiscal 2015, the company recorded $1.2 billion in sales through PBS. The company will continue to implement PBS technology for current PBS customers as they open new retail stores during 2016. In addition, new PBS customers will begin implementation during 2016. Revenue on PBS sales is recognized when the product is purchased by the end consumer because that is when title and risk of loss is transferred. Non-PBS sales are recognized when the product is delivered to the customer since that is when title and risk of loss is transferred.\nDerivative Instruments. The company's cost of primary raw materials is highly correlated to certain commodities markets. Commodities, such as our baking ingredients, experience price fluctuations. If actual market conditions become significantly different than those anticipated, raw material prices could increase significantly, adversely affecting our results of operations. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting to manage the impact of volatility in raw material prices. The company measures the fair value of its derivative portfolio using fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal market for that asset or liability. When quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities are not available, the company bases fair value on internally developed models that use current market observable inputs, such as exchange-quoted futures prices and yield curves.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The company records an impairment charge to property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting standards when, based on certain indicators of impairment, it believes such assets have experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of these underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset that may not be reflected in the asset's current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future. As discussed above, during fiscal 2015, we decided to close a production line at one of our bakeries and transition this production to another facility. We recognized an impairment loss of $1.5 million on the equipment we no longer intend to use. Based on management's evaluation, no impairment charges relating to long-lived held and used assets were recorded for fiscal years 2014 or 2013.\nThe company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its goodwill on an annual basis or at a time when events occur that indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may be impaired using a two-step process. We have elected not to perform the qualitative approach. The first step of this evaluation is performed by calculating the fair value of the business segment, or reporting unit, with which the goodwill is associated. Our reporting units are at the segment level. Each segment consists of several components. These components are aggregated by their respective delivery method into the Warehouse Segment and DSD Segment. These segments rely on reciprocal baking among their components, cross-sells their products/brands within the segment, and utilize the same delivery method. Marketing, research and development and capital projects are measured at the segment level. We believe these factors support our reporting unit classifications. This fair value is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, and if less than the carrying value, the goodwill is evaluated for potential impairment under step two. Under step two of this calculation, goodwill is measured for potential impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, determined in the same manner as a business combination, with the carrying amount of the goodwill.\nOur annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires management judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting units. Fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodologies incorporating market participant considerations and management's assumptions on revenue, revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, and EBITDA (defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). Our estimates can significantly affect the outcome of the test. We perform the fair value assessment using the income and market approach. We use this data to complete a separate fair value analysis for each reporting unit. Changes in our forecasted operating results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates. This test is performed in our fourth quarter unless circumstances require this analysis to be completed sooner. The income approach is tested using a sensitivity analysis to changes in the discount rate and yield a sufficient buffer to significant variances in our estimates. The estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded our carrying values in excess of $700 million in each reporting unit in fiscal 2015. Based on management's evaluation, other than the $2.6 million impairment loss related to our Ft. Worth, Texas tortilla facility discussed above, no other impairment charges relating to goodwill were recorded for the fiscal years 2015, 2014, or 2013.\nIn connection with acquisitions, the company has acquired trademarks, customer lists, and non-compete agreements, a portion of which are amortizable. The company evaluates these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The undiscounted future cash flows of each intangible asset is compared to the carrying amount, and if less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. The fair value is computed using the same approach described above for goodwill and includes the same risks and estimates. The fair value of the trademarks could be less than our carrying value if any of our four material assumptions in our fair value analysis: (a) weighted average cost of capital; (b) long-term sales growth rates; (c) forecasted operating margins; and (d) market multiples do not meet our expectations, thereby requiring us to record an asset impairment. We use the multi-period excess earnings and relief from royalty methods to value these intangibles. The method used for impairment testing purposes is consistent with the\nvaluation method employed at acquisition of the intangible asset. Based on management's evaluation, no impairment charges relating to amortizable intangible assets were recorded for the fiscal years 2015, 2014, or 2013.\nThe company also owns $414.0 million of trademarks acquired in acquisitions that are indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization. A total of $144.0 million of the trademarks were from the Lepage acquisition that occurred in July 2012. A total of $79.5 million and $189.0 million of the trademarks were from the Sara Lee California and the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets acquisitions, respectively, both completed in fiscal 2013. The company evaluates the recoverability by comparing the fair value to the carrying value of these intangible assets on an annual basis or at a time when events occur that indicate the carrying value may be impaired. In addition, the assets are evaluated to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite life. The fair value is compared to the carrying value of the intangible asset, and if less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to fair value. During fiscal 2015, in conjunction with the DKB and Alpine acquisitions, we determined that the Barowsky's trademark acquired in the Lepage acquisition would be used on a more regional basis as an organic brand rather than distributed nationally, and therefore is deemed to have a finite life. We began amortizing this trademark in fiscal 2015.\nThere are certain inherent risks included in our expectations about the performance of acquired trademarks and brands. If we are unable to implement our growth strategies for these acquired intangible assets as expected, it could adversely impact the carrying value of the brands. The fair value of the trademarks could be less than our carrying value if any of our four material assumptions in our fair value analysis: (a) weighted average cost of capital; (b) long-term sales growth rates; (c) forecasted operating margins; and (d) market multiples do not meet our expectations, thereby requiring us to record an asset impairment. There were no impairments recorded on intangible assets not subject to amortization for the fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nThe impairment analysis on the indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization is very sensitive to the long-term growth rates of the brand. The brands acquired in the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets have been valued based on our expectation of the timing reintroducing the brands. The company is also continually analyzing these brands to determine the expansion markets in which they will be introduced. If the timing of our expansion does not proceed as we currently anticipate, these brands could become impaired.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves. We are self-insured for various levels of general liability, auto liability, workers' compensation, and employee medical and dental coverage. Insurance reserves are calculated on an undiscounted basis and are based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed utilizing historical claim trends. Projected settlements and incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on pending claims and historical trends and data. Though the company does not expect them to do so, actual settlements and claims could differ materially from those estimated. Material differences in actual settlements and claims could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncome Tax Expense and Accruals. The annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in statutory rates and tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material effect on the annual tax rate. The effect of these changes, if any, would be recognized when the change takes place.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserve for uncertain tax benefits reflect our best assessment of future taxes to be paid in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if we believe it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance, which could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.\nPeriodically, we face audits from federal and state tax authorities, which can result in challenges regarding the timing and amount of income or deductions. We provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it more likely than not that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these reserves on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements that may impact the ultimate payment of such potential exposures. While the ultimate outcome of audits cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently believe that current or future audits will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The company is no longer subject to federal examination for years prior to fiscal 2012 and is currently under audit for fiscal years 2012 through 2014.\nPension Obligations. The company records pension costs and benefit obligations related to its defined benefit plans based on actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect key assumptions determined by management, including the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and mortality. Material changes in pension costs and in benefit obligations may occur in the future due to experience that is different than assumed and changes in these assumptions.\nEffective January 1, 2006, the company curtailed its largest defined benefit plan (Plan No. 1) that covered the majority of its workforce. Benefits under this plan are frozen, and no future benefits will accrue under this plan. The company assumed sponsorship of two defined benefit plans as part of the ButterKrust acquisition (2008) and a qualified defined benefit plan as part of the Tasty acquisition (2011); benefits under these plans are frozen, and no future benefits will accrue under these plans. The ButterKrust plans and the Tasty plan were merged into Plan No. 1 effective December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012, respectively. In addition to Plan No. 1, the company sponsors an ongoing defined benefit pension plan for union employees (Plan No. 2) and a frozen nonqualified plan covering former Tasty executives.\nThe company recorded pension income of $6.0 million on our qualified defined benefit plans for fiscal 2015. We recorded pension cost of $5.6 million for fiscal 2014 (inclusive of a $15.4 million settlement charge for lump sums paid in the fourth quarter of 2014). We expect pension income of approximately $6.2 million on our qualified defined benefit plans for fiscal 2016.\nIn September 2014, the company announced a one-time voluntary lump sum offer to approximately 2,500 former employees in Plan No. 1 and 2 who had not yet started receiving monthly payments of their vested benefits. The offer supported the company's pension risk management strategy and reduced plan obligations by 10%. Distributions of $50.4 million in lump sums from existing plan assets for Plan 1 and Plan 2 in December 2014 resulted in a settlement charge of $15.4 million for Plan No. 1 only. No settlement charge was required for Plan No. 2 as the distributions were not in excess of service costs and interest costs for fiscal 2014.\nOn January 1, 2016, the company began providing pension plan participants who have not yet started their payments the option to receive their benefit as a single lump sum payment. Participants can elect this option when they retire or when they leave the company. This change supports our long-term pension risk management strategy. The amount of the lump sum payments may trigger a settlement charge in fiscal 2016 but at this time we are not able to estimate the possible impact, if any.\nIn 2016, we will refine the method used to estimate service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs. Historically, we estimated the service cost and interest cost components using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. Going forward, we will use a spot rate approach to estimate these components of benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows, as we believe this provides a better estimate of service and interest costs. We consider this a change in estimate and accordingly, will account for it prospectively starting in 2016. This change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligation.\nIn developing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at each measurement date, the company considers the plan assets' historical actual returns, targeted asset allocations, and the anticipated future economic environment and long-term performance of individual asset classes, based on the company's investment strategy. While appropriate consideration is given to recent and historical investment performance, the assumption represents management's best estimate of the long-term prospective return. Based on these factors, the long-term rate of return assumption for the plans was set at 8.0% for fiscal 2015, as compared with the average annual return on the plans' assets over the past 15 years of approximately 6.9% (net of expenses). The plan has an average annual rate of return since inception in 1987 of 9.1% (net of expenses). The expected long-term rate of return assumption is based on a target asset allocation of 40-60% equity securities, 10-40% fixed income securities, 0-25% real estate, 0-40% other diversifying strategies (including, absolute return funds, hedged equity funds, and guaranteed insurance contracts), and 0-25% short-term investments and cash. The company regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the plan assets to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Pension costs do not include an explicit expense assumption and the return on assets rate reflects the long-term expected return, net of expenses. For the details of our pension plan assets, see Note 19, Postretirement Plans, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nThe company utilizes the Society of Actuaries' ( SOA\u201d) published mortality tables and improvement scales in developing their best estimates of mortality. In October 2014, the SOA published final reports on their standard\u201d mortality table ( RP-2014\u201d) and mortality improvement scale ( MP-2014\u201d). In October 2015, the SOA published a revised mortality improvement scale ( MP-2015\u201d). Based on an evaluation of the information released in 2015, the Company updated the mortality assumptions for purposes of measuring pension benefit obligations at year-end 2015. The Company will continue to use the standard mortality tables and mortality improvement scale with adjustments to the base table as applicable: 15% adjustment for Plan No. 1 and blue collar adjustment for Plan No. 2. The change to the mortality assumption decreased the year-end pension benefit obligations by $6.3 million.\nThe company determines the fair value of substantially all of its plans' assets utilizing market quotes rather than developing smoothed\u201d values, market related\u201d values, or other modeling techniques. Plan asset gains or losses in a given year are included with other actuarial gains and losses due to remeasurement of the plans' projected benefit obligations ( PBO\u201d). If the total unrecognized gain or loss exceeds 10% of the larger of (i) the PBO or (ii) the market value of plan assets, the excess of the total unrecognized gain or loss is amortized over the expected average future lifetime of participants in the frozen pension plans. The total unrecognized loss as of December 31, 2015 for the pension plans the company sponsors is $144.1 million. The company uses a calendar year end for the measurement date since the plans are based on a calendar year and because it approximates the company's fiscal year end.\nAmortization of this unrecognized loss during fiscal 2016 is expected to be approximately $6.2 million. To the extent that this unrecognized loss is subsequently recognized, the loss will increase the company's pension costs in the future.\nA sensitivity analysis of fiscal 2015 pension costs on a pre-tax basis and year-end benefit obligations for our qualified plans is presented in the table below (amounts in thousands) to changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets ( EROA\u201d):\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> Percentage increase (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25%\nDiscount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.25%)\nDiscount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25%\nEROA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.25%)\nEROA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estimated change in FY 2015 pension costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (121\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (927\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estimated change in FY 2015 year-end benefit\nobligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,651\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted is determined based on the grant date fair value. The company recognizes these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate, and recognizes compensation cost only for those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term of the share-based payment award.\nEmployee grants issued before fiscal 2012 included non-qualified stock options ( NQSOs\u201d) and performance-contingent stock awards ( PSAs\u201d). The NQSOs were valued using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The inputs for the model include an expected life, risk-free rate, expected volatility, and dividend yield. The PSAs incorporated a market and performance condition component. However, because of the market condition the expense amount would only change if we determined the performance condition was triggered. The performance condition was always satisfied and adjustments were never made. The market condition was dependent on certain market benchmarks but the expense for these awards never changed.\nIn fiscal 2013, 2014, and 2015, we granted PSAs that separately have a market and performance condition. The expense computed for the total shareholder return shares ( TSR\u201d) is fixed and recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The expense computed for the return on invested capital ( ROIC\u201d) shares can change depending on the attainment of performance condition goals. The expense for the ROIC shares can be within a range of 0% to 125% of the target. There is a possibility that this expense component will change in subsequent quarters depending on how the company performs relative to the ROIC target. The payouts for the TSR and ROIC shares to be issued in fiscal 2016 (on the 2014 awards) are estimated to be 27% and 96%, respectively.\nOur Chief Executive Officer ( CEO\u201d) received a time-based restricted stock award of approximately $1.3 million in 2013, which will vest 100% on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant provided the CEO remains employed by the company during this time. This award is being expensed on a straight line basis over the four year vesting period.\nCommitments and contingencies. The company and its subsidiaries from time to time are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including personal injury, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, product liability, health and safety and employment matters, including lawsuits related to the independent distributors, which are being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. While the company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it believes, based upon currently available facts, that it is remote that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its overall financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future. However, adverse developments could negatively impact earnings in a particular future fiscal period.\nResults of Operations\nMatters Affecting Analysis\nFiscal 2014 Week 53. The sales impact in our Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal 2014 week 53 was $63.2 million. The DSD Segment and Warehouse Segment impact was $53.4 million and $9.8 million, respectively. The impact to fiscal 2014 earnings per share was $0.01 per share.\nReporting Periods. The company operates on a 52-53 week fiscal year ending the Saturday nearest December 31. Fiscal 2014 consisted of 53 weeks. Fiscal 2015 and 2013 consisted of 52 weeks.\nRevision of prior period sales and Impairment of Assets. Refer to the Overview\u201d section above for a description of each of these items. Acquisitions are described below.\nAlpine Valley Bread acquisition (2015)\nOn October 13, 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Alpine Valley Bread Company, a family-owned producer of certified organic and all natural breads in the U.S. The acquisition expands our penetration into the organic market and provides additional organic production capacity.\nDave's Killer Bread acquisition (2015)\nOn September 12, 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Dave's Killer Bread, the nation's best-selling organic bread. We believe the acquisition of DKB strengthens our position as the second-largest baker in the U.S. by giving us access to the fast growing organic bread category and expanding our geographic reach into the Pacific Northwest.\nModesto, California acquisition (2013)\nOn July 27, 2013, the company completed the acquisition of certain assets related to a bun line in Modesto, California that now serves the California market for a total cash payment of $10.3 million. This acquisition is included in our DSD Segment and the total goodwill for this acquisition was $4.2 million.\nHostess Bread assets acquisition (2013)\nOn July 19, 2013, the company completed the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets acquisition for a total cash payment of $355.3 million. We continue to incur carrying costs on the acquired properties and depots not currently in operation and in fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, these costs were $12.8 million, $19.5 million and $10.6 million, respectively. These costs include workforce-related costs, property taxes, utilities, and depreciation, among other costs and were primarily included in the materials, supplies, labor, and other production costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately) line item in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. We began re-introducing the brands associated with the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets to the marketplace in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.\nSara Lee California acquisition (2013)\nOn February 23, 2013, the company completed its acquisition of certain assets and trademark licenses from BBU, Inc., a subsidiary of Grupo Bimbo, SAB de CV ( BBU\u201d), for a total cash payment of $50.0 million. The company acquired from BBU in the acquisition: (1) perpetual, exclusive, and royalty-free licenses to the Sara Lee and Earthgrains brands for sliced breads, buns, and rolls in the state of California and (2) a closed bakery in Stockton, California. In addition, we received a perpetual, exclusive, and royalty-free license to the Earthgrains brand for a broad range of fresh bakery products in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma market area. We financed this acquisition with cash on hand and debt. We believe the California acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase because the Department of Justice (the DOJ\u201d) required BBU to divest these assets, which resulted in a more favorable price to us than would have normally resulted from a typical arms-length negotiation. Accordingly, the fair value of the assets acquired exceeded the consideration paid by approximately $50.1 million after tax. The company agreed to a $10.0 million escrow holdback provision as a part of the Sara Lee California acquisition of which the company received $7.5 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The escrow holdback is described in more detail in Note 8, Acquisitions, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nThe company's results of operations, expressed as a
