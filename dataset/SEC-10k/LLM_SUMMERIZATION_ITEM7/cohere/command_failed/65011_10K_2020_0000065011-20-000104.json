Today, Meredith uses multiple distribution platforms- including print, digital, mobile, video, and broadcast television-to provide consumers with content they desire and to deliver the messages of its advertising and marketing partners.\nMeredith operates two business segments. The national media segment serves more than 190 million unduplicated American consumers, including 120 million women and 90 percent of U.S. millennial women. Meredith is a leader\nin creating content across media platforms and life stages in key consumer interest areas such as entertainment, food, lifestyle, parenting, and home. Meredith's leading national brands include People, Better Homes & Gardens, InStyle, Allrecipes, Real Simple, Shape, Southern Living, and Martha Stewart Living. The national media segment also features robust brand licensing activities, including more than 3,000 SKUs of branded products at 4,000 Walmart stores across the U.S. and at Walmart.com. The national media segment also includes leading affinity marketer Synapse, and The Foundry 360, the Company's state-of-the-art creative lab and content studio.\nMeredith's local media segment includes 17 television stations in 12 markets reaching 11 percent of U.S. households and nearly 30 million viewers. Meredith's portfolio is concentrated in large, fast-growing markets, with seven stations in the nation's Top 25 markets-including Atlanta, Phoenix, St. Louis, and Portland-and 13 in the Top 50. Meredith's stations produce 745 hours of local news and entertainment content each week and operate leading local digital destinations. The local media segment also includes MNI, which delivers targeted advertising solutions to more than 1,200 clients on a local, regional, and national level.\nBoth segments operate primarily in the U.S. and compete against similar media and other types of media on both a local and national basis. In fiscal 2020, the national media segment accounted for 73 percent of the Company's $2.8 billion in revenues while local media segment revenues contributed 27 percent.\nThe Company accomplished a number of initiatives during fiscal 2020, including increasing brand engagement with consumers and advertisers and improving our competitive position. Highlights include:\nFirst, in fiscal 2020 we added to our digital businesses and capabilities. For example:\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We built a new technology platform with robust data capabilities supporting our expanding digital activities. This new proprietary platform, which unifies legacy platforms onto the same technology stack, includes not only our content management system, but also our proprietary taxonomy, our first-party data, and our user identity graph. This prepares us well for a world where third party cookies are no longer supported.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIt also allows us to bring together consumer profiles, real-time insights, and intent signals to predict trends that inform our editorial and product roadmap, provide more personalized experiences to our consumers, and give advertisers the ability to tailor the right messages and products to the users most likely to buy at any given time.\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We advanced our video and audio strategies. Video views grew more than 50 percent in fiscal 2020 across our owned and operated properties. Responding to consumer demand, we published a third more videos during fiscal 2020. We also launched a series of new podcasts under the Allrecipes, Southern Living, and Parents brands as a way to tell stories in an increasingly popular way. We have more planned, including a new People podcast.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We added to our subscription acquisition and e-commerce capabilities, which are important avenues for growth. Meredith first entered the e-commerce space with the acquisition of ShopNation seven years ago. Since then, revenue growth from our e-commerce activities, including digital couponing, content, and affiliate commerce, has been exceptionally strong - up 28 percent in fiscal 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSecond, we launched a series of new brands, product expansions, and re-alignments to improve profitability in fiscal 2020. In our national media operations, we:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Launched Reveal, a new lifestyle magazine partnering with Property Brothers television show hosts Drew and Jonathan Scott; Sweet July, with best-selling author, restaurateur, and television host Ayesha Curry; and a new multimedia personal finance brand Millie that is dedicated to helping women achieve their financial goals.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Re-aligned several brands in our national media portfolio to improve efficiency. This included closing Family Circle magazine and transitioning Rachael Ray Every Day to a premium newsstand title published on a quarterly basis. This strategy has proven successful with other of our brands, including Coastal Living, Cooking Light, and Traditional Home. The latter three brands are now also offering subscriptions at a higher price point than under the previous advertising-driven model.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Completed the last of our planned asset sales.

People Now was a weekend program during fiscal 2020 and is expected to become a daily primetime show across our network in early fiscal 2021. Similarly, Southern Living has been expanded to weekly syndication. Leveraging our leading brands across additional platforms is an exciting opportunity and something we hope to scale over time.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continued to expand news production and are now producing 745 hours of local content each week.

In these challenging times, consumers are looking to Meredith's trusted brands for important news and information, practical advice, home improvement ideas, recipes, inspiration, and moments of escape.\nIn our national media operations:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Visits to our digital brands grew by 14 percent in our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter compared to the prior-year period, driven by strong growth in brands focused on food, health, and home lifestyle categories that give Meredith access to an extremely wide audience.

Allrecipes, which has seen strong consumer growth with an acceleration due to COVID-19, is now the industry's No. 2 brand. Better Homes & Gardens is also in the top 10.

It also drove digital results, as the number of visits to our local media sites grew 18 percent in fiscal 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We grew retransmission revenues by 10 percent in fiscal 2020 as we renewed nearly 60 percent of our retransmission consent relationships and all our CBS affiliations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNATIONAL MEDIA\nAdvertising related revenues made up 48 percent of fiscal 2020 national media revenues. These revenues were generated from the sale of advertising space in our magazines and on our digital properties to clients interested in promoting their brands, products, and services to consumers as well as revenue we generate selling advertising space on third-party platforms. Changes in advertising related revenues tend to correlate with changes in the level of economic activity in the U.S. Indicators of economic activity include changes in the level of gross domestic product, consumer spending, housing starts, unemployment rates, auto sales, and interest rates. Circulation levels of Meredith's magazines, reader demographic data, and the advertising rates charged relative to other comparable available advertising opportunities also affect the level of advertising related revenues.\nConsumer related revenues accounted for 48 percent of fiscal 2020 national media revenues. Consumer related revenue includes all revenues either driven by or otherwise linked to consumer buying decisions and include circulation activities; magazine subscriptions sales for third-party publishers; brand licensing; digital lead generation; and other e-commerce sales, product sales, and related activities. Circulation revenues result from the sale of magazines to consumers through subscriptions and by single copy sales on newsstands in print form, primarily at major retailers and grocery/drug stores, and in digital form on tablets and other media devices. In the short term, subscription revenues, which accounted for 61 percent of consumer related revenues, are less susceptible to economic changes because subscriptions are generally sold for terms of one to three years. The same economic factors that affect advertising related revenues also can influence consumers' response to subscription offers and result in lower revenues and/or higher costs to maintain subscriber levels over time. Subscription revenues per copy and related costs can also vary significantly by subscription source. Some subscription sources generate lower revenues than other sources but have proportionately lower related costs. A key factor in our subscription success is our industry-leading database. It contains an abundance of attributes on 180 million individuals, including 90 percent of U.S. millennial women. The size and depth of our database is a key to our circulation model and allows more precise consumer targeting. Newsstand revenues are more volatile than subscription revenues and can vary significantly month-to-month depending on economic and other factors. The remaining consumer related revenues are generally affected by changes in the level of economic activity in the U.S., including changes in the level of gross domestic product, consumer spending, unemployment rates, and interest rates.\nThe remaining 4 percent of national media revenues came from a variety of activities that included the sale of customer relationship marketing products and services. In addition, for certain sold brands, Meredith has provided consumer marketing, subscription fulfillment, paper purchasing, printing, and other services under outsourcing agreements and records such revenue in other revenue.\nNational media's major expense categories are employee compensation costs and production and delivery of publications and promotional mailings. Employee compensation, which includes benefits expense, represented 18 percent of national media's operating expenses in fiscal 2020. Compensation expense is affected by salary and incentive levels, the number of employees, the costs of our various employee benefit plans, and other factors.\nPaper, postage, and production charges represented 17 percent of the segment's operating expenses in fiscal 2020. The price of paper can vary significantly on the basis of worldwide demand and supply for paper in general and for specific types of paper used by Meredith. The printing of our publications is outsourced. We have a multi-year contract for the printing of our magazines, a practice which reduces price fluctuations over the contract term. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the USPS and legislative mandates imposed on the USPS. The USPS adjusted rates most recently in January 2020, which resulted in an increase of approximately 1.9 percent. While we expect postage rates to increase again in January 2021, an ongoing legislatively mandated review of the existing law by the Postal Regulatory Commission could potentially result in adjustments to the current rate-setting regime. Meredith continues to work independently and with others to encourage and help the USPS find and implement efficiencies to contain rate increases.\nImpairment charges accounted for 16 percent of national media's fiscal 2020 expenses. The remaining 49 percent of fiscal 2020 national media expenses included depreciation and amortization, costs for magazine newsstand distribution, advertising and promotional efforts, and overhead costs for facilities and technology services.\nLOCAL MEDIA\nLocal media derives the majority of its revenues-53 percent in fiscal 2020-from the sale of spot advertising on our stations' digital and mobile media properties as well as revenue we generate selling advertising space on third-party platforms. The remainder comes from television retransmission consent fees, television production, and other services.\nThe stations sell advertising to both local/regional and national accounts. Political advertising revenues are cyclical in that they are significantly greater during biennial election campaigns (which take place primarily in odd-numbered fiscal years) than at other times. We generate additional revenues from digital activities and programs focused on local interests such as community events and college and professional sports.\nChanges in advertising related revenues tend to correlate with changes in the level of economic activity in the U.S. and in the local markets in which we operate stations, and with the cyclical changes in political advertising discussed previously. Programming content, audience share, audience demographics, and the advertising rates charged relative to other available advertising opportunities also affect advertising revenues. On occasion, unusual events necessitate uninterrupted television coverage and will adversely affect spot advertising revenues.\nLocal media's major expense categories are programming fees paid to the networks and employee compensation. Programming fees paid to the networks represented 34 percent of this segment's fiscal 2020 expenses. Employee compensation represented 29 percent of local media's operating expenses in fiscal 2020 and is affected by the same factors noted for national media. Sales and promotional activities, costs to produce local news programming, and general overhead costs for facilities and technical resources accounted for most of the remaining 37 percent of local media's fiscal 2020 operating expenses.\nFISCAL 2020 FINANCIAL OVERVIEW\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $252.7 million to reduce the carrying value of the national media segment's goodwill.

Following the Overview is an analysis of the results of operations for the national media and local media segments and an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the last three fiscal years.\nAcquisitions\nOn January 31, 2018, Meredith completed its acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Time. As a result, Time became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Meredith. Since February 1, 2018, the first day of operations for the combined company, the operating results of Time have been included in the Company's consolidated operating results. While the majority of Time's operations are reported in Meredith's national media segment, one business unit of Time is reported in Meredith's local media segment and certain expenses are reported in unallocated corporate. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nAs the Company integrated Time, the ability to separately track Time-related revenues and expenses, especially unallocated corporate expenses, became less feasible. Therefore, throughout MD&A reasonable estimates of incremental Time revenues and expenses for fiscal 2019 have been disclosed where possible.\nTrends and Uncertainties\nAdvertising revenues accounted for 49 percent of total revenues in fiscal 2020. Advertising demand is the Company's key uncertainty, and its fluctuation from period to period can have a material effect on operating results. Demand for political advertising in the Company's local media segment is cyclical in nature, generally following the biennial cycle of election campaigns with peaks occurring in our odd fiscal years (e.g., fiscal 2019, fiscal 2021) and particularly in our second quarter of those fiscal years. Other significant uncertainties that can affect operating results include fluctuations in the cost of paper, postage rates, and over time, television programming rights. The Company's cash flows from operating activities, our primary source of liquidity, is adversely affected when the advertising market is weak or when costs rise. One of our priorities is to manage our businesses prudently during expanding and contracting economic cycles to maximize shareholder return over time. To manage the uncertainties inherent in our businesses, we prepare monthly internal forecasts of anticipated results of operations and monitor\nthe economic indicators mentioned in the Executive Overview. See Item 1A - Risk Factors in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nNATIONAL MEDIA\nThe following discussion reviews operating results for our national media segment, which includes magazine publishing, digital and customer relationship marketing, digital and mobile media, affinity marketing, brand licensing, database-related activities, and other related operations. The national media segment contributed 73 percent of Meredith's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2020.\nFiscal 2020 national media revenues declined 11 percent. Costs and expenses decreased 11 percent, and impairment charges of $367.0 million were recorded in the national media segment. Due to the impairment charges, the national media operations reported an operating loss of $167.7 million in fiscal 2020.\nNational media revenues increased 48 percent in fiscal 2019. Operating costs and expenses increased 48 percent. Acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities of $54.3 million and impairment charges of $41.8 million were recorded in the national media segment. Operating profit increased 48 percent primarily due to having a full year of results of the acquired Time business in fiscal 2019.\nNational media operating results for the last three fiscal years were as follows:\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Advertising related revenue decreased 14 percent in fiscal 2020.\nMeredith has made changes to its portfolio of brands and titles intended to enhance the consumer experience, provide more effective and efficient platforms for advertisers, and increase the profitability of the portfolio. These changes included closing the Money, Martha Stewart Weddings, and Family Circle magazines, changing the frequency of Entertainment Weekly to a monthly title, transitioning Coastal Living, Traditional Home, and Rachael Ray Every Day to premium newsstand titles, and merging Cooking Light into Meredith's popular EatingWell title, which resulted in declines in combined print advertising revenues of approximately $60.0 million in fiscal 2020. Of\nthe remaining decline in print advertising revenues of $76.6 million, the Company estimates that advertising cancellations and delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $45.2 million adverse impact in fiscal 2020, with $41.3 million of the decline coming in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. The remaining decrease in print advertising revenues is primarily due to changing market demands for print advertising.\nDigital advertising decreased 5 percent in fiscal 2020. While the Company saw increased digital advertising revenues during the first eight months of fiscal 2020, the Company estimates that cancellations and delays in digital advertising revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $33.0 million adverse impact in fiscal 2020 with $27.0 million of this impact occurring in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nThe 3 percent decrease in third party sales was primarily due to reductions in cover wrap sales as well as decreases in advertising pages in publications the Company produces on behalf of others. The Company estimates that cancellations and delays in digital third party sales due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $3.5 million adverse impact during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nWhile the Company is not able to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenues into fiscal 2021, the Company is seeing improvement in advertising related revenues into the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and, if the economy continues to recover, the Company expects this trend to continue into fiscal 2021. Future actions such as renewed shelter-in-place or business closing orders could negatively impact these expectations.\nNational media advertising related revenue increased 48 percent in fiscal 2019. The increase in print advertising was primarily due to the addition of print advertising revenues of Time partially offset by a 10 percent decline in comparative print advertising revenues. Approximately 30 percent of the decline in comparative print advertising revenue was due to changes to the marketing of Fit Pregnancy and Baby and Family Fun magazines. While the women's service category of titles saw a slight increase in print advertising revenues, the lifestyle and parenthood categories saw declines. Digital advertising increased primarily due to the addition of digital advertising revenues of Time. Comparative digital advertising revenues increased 14 percent in fiscal 2019. The increase in third party sales was primarily due to the addition of Time.\nConsumer Related Revenue\nConsumer related revenue includes all revenues either driven by or otherwise linked to consumer buying decisions. Fiscal 2020 consumer related revenues declined 9 percent as compared to the prior year.\nApproximately 65 percent of the decline in subscription revenue was due to the portfolio changes detailed above. In addition, a trade book line of business was closed, which resulted in a $5.4 million decrease in subscription revenue in fiscal 2020. The remaining decrease in subscription revenue in fiscal 2020 was due primarily to a change in mix to subscriptions received directly by the Company. Subscriptions received directly by the Company tend to have lower subscription revenues, lower acquisition costs, and higher renewal rates. Digital and other consumer driven revenue increased primarily due to increases in ecommerce revenues from direct product sales and lead generation referrals. The Company estimates that shelter-in-place orders and reductions in travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $17.6 million adverse impact on newsstand revenues in the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2020.\nConsumer related revenue increased 69 percent in fiscal 2019. The increases in subscription and newsstand revenues were primarily due to the addition of subscription revenues of Time partially offset by approximately 10 percent declines in comparative subscription and newsstand revenues. Digital and other consumer driven revenue increased primarily due to the growth in e-commerce revenues. The increases in the remaining categories of consumer related revenue were primarily due to the addition of Time revenues.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue increased 15 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the delivery of episodes of a streaming program created for a third party. The Company estimates that the cancellation of events sponsored by the Company due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $9.0 million adverse impact on other revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nFiscal 2019 other revenue decreased 48 percent primarily due to declines of $83.6 million in Meredith Xcelerated Marketing (MXM) revenues due to the sale of MXM in fiscal 2018.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nNational media operating costs and expenses decreased 11 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower combined production, distribution, and paper costs of $86.4 million, a reduction in employee-related compensation costs of $54.1 million, a decline in non-payroll editorial costs of $48.0 million, and a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $30.0 million.\nThe Company estimates the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a reduction in national media operating costs and expenses of $52.8 million in fiscal 2020, relating to reductions in production, distribution, editorial, employee-related compensation, performance-based compensation expenses, and selling expenses.\nWhile the Company is not able to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operating costs and expenses into fiscal 2021, the Company expects that to the extent advertising related revenues recover, related direct costs and expenses will also increase.\nFiscal 2019 national media costs and expenses increased 48 percent primarily due to the addition of Time operating costs and expenses of $767.4 million and an increase in employee compensation and related costs of $24.0 million partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of MXM of $86.9 million and a reduction in circulation expenses of $18.2 million.\nAcquisition, Disposition, and Restructuring Related Activities\nNational media acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities decreased $51.9 million in fiscal 2020 primarily due to declines in severance and related benefit expenses of $36.7 million and a reduction in integration costs of $18.3 million.\nFiscal 2019 national media acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities increased 26 percent primarily due to an increase in integration costs of $21.8 million partially offset by a decrease in severance and related benefit expenses of $12.3 million.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the national media segment recorded a non-cash impairment of goodwill of $252.7 million, non-cash impairments of an operating lease asset and associated leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures totaling $87.9 million, and non-cash impairments of trademarks of $21.2 million. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the national media segment recorded a $5.2 million non-cash impairment of a trademark. The magnitude of the impairments of goodwill and other long-lived assets recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was unfavorably impacted by the recent volatility of the financial markets and the uncertainty surrounding the long-term economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe national media segment recorded non-cash impairment charges of $41.8 million in fiscal 2019 related to trademarks.\nOperating Profit (Loss)\nNational media operations resulted in a $167.7 million loss in fiscal 2020 reflecting the $367.0 million non-cash impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets. Absent the impairment charges in both years, national media operating profit would have been $199.3 million, an increase of 19 percent when compared to $167.8 million in fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to previously executed restructuring activities and ongoing cost-savings initiatives reducing operating expenses partially offset by a reduction in revenues as discussed above.\nFiscal 2019 national media operating profit grew to $126.0 million primarily due to operating income from Time of $79.1 million and an increase in the profit contribution of our digital consumer products operations of $7.6 million partially offset by a $33.9 million decrease in the profit contribution of our magazine operations and an increase in the impairment of trademarks of $19.1 million.\nLOCAL MEDIA\nThe following discussion reviews operating results for the Company's local media segment, which consists of 17 television stations and related digital and mobile media as well as MNI, which generates revenue through the sale of geographic and demographic-targeted digital and print advertising programs sold to third parties. The local media segment contributed 27 percent of Meredith's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2020.\nFiscal 2020 local media revenues declined 11 percent and operating profit decreased 48 percent primarily due to lower political advertising due to the cyclical nature of such revenues, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenues, and a non-cash impairment charge.\nLocal media revenues rose 25 percent and operating profit grew 49 percent in fiscal 2019 primarily reflecting increased cyclical political advertising and higher retransmission consent revenues.\nLocal media operating results for the last three fiscal years were as follows:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended June 30,\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>769.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>863.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>693.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses\n</td> <td>(598.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(584.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(505.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of long-lived assets\n</td> <td>(22.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>(623.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(585.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(506.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>278.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>n/m -

Advertising related revenue declined 24 percent. Political spot advertising revenues totaled $23.9 million in the current year compared with $102.9 million in the prior year. Fluctuations in political spot advertising revenues at our stations and throughout the broadcasting industry generally follow the biennial cycle of election campaigns.\nNon-political spot advertising revenues declined 12 percent. Local non-political spot advertising revenues decreased 13 percent and national non-political spot advertising revenues declined 9 percent in fiscal 2020. The Company estimates that cancellations and delays in non-political spot revenues due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $37.2 million adverse impact on non-political spot revenues during fiscal 2020, with $30.7 million of this impact occurring in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nDigital advertising revenues increased 12 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to increased programmatic ad and video sales. The Company estimates that cancellations and delays in digital advertising revenues due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $0.8 million adverse impact on digital advertising revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nThird party sales, which represent revenue generated through selling advertising space on third-party platforms, declined 16 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to decreased coverwrap and print insert sales. The Company estimates that cancellations and delays in third party sales due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $7.4 million adverse impact on third party sales revenue during fiscal 2020, with $6.4 million of this impact occurring in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nLocal media revenues increased 25 percent in fiscal 2019. Advertising related revenues increased 29 percent. Political advertising revenues increased primarily due to the November 2018 elections. Political spot advertising revenues totaled $102.9 million in fiscal 2019 compared with $16.1 million in fiscal 2018. Political spot advertising displaces a certain amount of non-political spot advertising; therefore, the revenues are not entirely incremental.\nNon-political spot advertising revenues decreased 3 percent in fiscal 2019 due primarily to political spot advertising displacement. Local non-political advertising revenues declined 5 percent and national non-political advertising revenues decreased 3 percent in fiscal 2019. Digital advertising revenues increased slightly as compared to the prior year. Third party sales increased primarily due to the addition of revenues from Time.\nWhile the Company is not able to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenues into fiscal 2021, the Company saw month-by-month improvement in advertising related revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and, if the economy continues to recover, the Company expects this trend to continue into fiscal 2021. Future actions such as renewed shelter-in-place or business closing orders could negatively impact these expectations.\nConsumer Related Revenue\nConsumer related revenue represents retransmission consent fees from cable, satellite, and telecommunications operators. Consumer related revenue increased in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 primarily due to annual escalators and renegotiated contracts.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue increased 48 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to increased revenues from programming streams on digital channels. Fiscal 2019 other revenue increased 65 percent primarily due to an increase in closed captioning revenues.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nFiscal 2020 operating costs and expenses increased 2 percent primarily due to higher programming fees paid to affiliated networks of $27.2 million partially offset by reductions in third party acquisition costs of $6.2 million and performance-based compensation expenses of $3.8 million.\nThe Company estimates the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a reduction in local media operating costs and expenses of $12.5 million in fiscal 2020. Of the reductions in third party acquisition costs and performance-based compensation expenses noted above, the Company estimates that $5.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, were related to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company also estimates that employee-related compensation expenses declined $3.9 million and other costs and expenses were lower by $1.5 million due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhile the Company is not able to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operating costs and expenses into fiscal 2021, the Company expects that, to the extent advertising related revenues recover, related direct costs and expenses will also increase.\nFiscal 2019 operating costs and expenses increased 16 percent primarily due to the addition of operating expenses from Time of $44.6 million and the addition of higher programming fees paid to affiliated networks of $30.5 million.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $22.3 million to reduce the value of one of the local media segment's FCC licenses.\nOperating Profit\nFiscal 2020 operating profit declined 48 percent primarily due to lower political advertising revenues of $79.0 million, an estimated reduction in operating profit of $32.9 million due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the non-cash impairment charge of $22.3 million.\nLocal media operating profit increased 49 percent in fiscal 2019 primarily due to the increase in high-margin political spot advertising revenues.\nUNALLOCATED CORPORATE EXPENSES\nUnallocated corporate expenses are general corporate overhead expenses not attributable to the operating groups. These expenses for the last three fiscal years were as follows:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended June 30,\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities\n</td> <td>22.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated corporate expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnallocated corporate expenses decreased 38 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to decreases in integration and exit costs of $22.7 million, performance-based compensation expenses of $17.2 million, employee-related compensation costs of $6.1 million, and consulting services expenses of $4.3 million partially offset by increases in other miscellaneous business expenses.\nUnallocated corporate expenses decreased $67.5 million in fiscal 2019 primarily due to decreases in severance and related benefit expenses of $47.1 million, a reduction in transaction and integration-related costs of $17.2 million, and absence of accelerated share-based compensation expenses of $9.2 million related to Time awards that vested upon acquisition in fiscal 2018 and of $3.5 million in accelerated share-based compensation expense related to involuntary terminations. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $9.2 million in consulting services expense.\nOf the $17.2 million reduction in performance-based compensation expenses in fiscal 2020, the Company estimates that $4.4 million of that reduction was due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenues and operating results of the Company. Other than the reduction in performance-based compensation expenses and a reduction of $1.1 million in other expenses, the Company estimates that the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a significant impact on unallocated corporate operating costs and expenses during fiscal 2020. In addition, the Company does not anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a significant impact on unallocated corporate operating costs and expenses in fiscal 2021.\nCONSOLIDATED\nConsolidated Operating Expenses\nConsolidated operating expenses for the last three fiscal years were as follows:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended June 30,\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Production, distribution, and editorial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,047.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,161.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>868.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general, and administrative\n</td> <td>1,259.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,350.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>987.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities\n</td> <td>26.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>219.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>247.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets\n</td> <td>389.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,942.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,901.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,177.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>n/m - Not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduction, Distribution, and Editorial Costs\nProduction, distribution, and editorial costs decreased 10 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower combined production, distribution, and paper costs of $86.4 million and a decline in non-payroll related editorial costs of $48.0 million partially offset by an increase in programming fees paid to affiliated networks of $27.2 million.\nFiscal 2019 production, distribution, and editorial costs increased 34 percent as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the addition of production, distribution, and editorial costs of Time of $290.5 million and increases in programming fees paid to affiliated networks of $30.5 million. These increases were partially offset by declines in production, distribution, and editorial expenses of MXM of $26.9 million.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses declined 7 percent primarily due to a reduction in employee compensation costs of $49.0 million, decreases in performance-based compensation expenses of $26.5 million, and a reduction in third party acquisition costs of $17.5 million.\nFiscal 2019 selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 37 percent primarily due to an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses of Time in our national and local media segments of $406.0 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses of MXM of $60.0 million.\nAcquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities\nAcquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities expense declined by 73 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to reductions in severance and related benefit costs of $36.7 million and declines in integration and exit costs of $41.0 million.\nFiscal 2019 acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities expense primarily included $51.5 million of severance and related benefit costs and $64.6 million of integration costs primarily for business advisors and software and systems implementations and modifications, and a credit for a gain on the sale of the Company's 30 percent interest in Charleston Tennis of $6.4 million.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased 11 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to reductions in depreciation expense of $18.6 million and in amortization expense of $11.4 million in our national media segment.\nThe increase in fiscal 2019 depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the addition of Time's depreciation and amortization expense.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Long-lived Assets\nThe Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $252.7 million in fiscal 2020 to reduce the carrying value of the national media segment's goodwill. In addition, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $87.9 million in the national media segment related to vacant leased space at its location in New York City. The Company also recorded non-cash impairment charges of $26.4 million to reduce the value of several of the national media segment's trademarks and $22.3 million to reduce the value of one of the local media segment's FCC licenses. The magnitude of the impairments of goodwill and other long-lived assets were unfavorably impacted by the volatility of the financial markets and the uncertainty surrounding the long-term economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe impairment of long-lived assets recorded in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 related primarily to non-cash impairments of trademarks in the national media segment.\nOperating Expenses\nEmployee compensation, including benefits, was the largest component of our operating expenses in fiscal 2020. Employee compensation represented 23 percent of total operating expenses in fiscal 2020, compared to 26 percent\nin fiscal 2019, and 38 percent in fiscal 2018. National media paper, production, and postage combined expense was the second largest component of our operating costs in fiscal 2020, representing 13 percent of the total. These expenses were 15 percent of total operating expenses in fiscal 2019 and 14 percent of total operating expenses in fiscal 2018.\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\nFiscal 2020 loss from operations of $94.1 million was a decrease of $381.1 million from fiscal 2019 income from operations of $287.0 million. The decrease is primarily due to non-cash impairment charges of $389.3 million. Absent impairment charges in both years, fiscal 2020 income from operations would have been $295.2 million, a decrease of 10 percent compared to $328.8 million in fiscal 2019, primarily due to an estimated impact from the COVID-19 pandemic of $83.1 million and a reduction in political revenues of $79.0 million more than offsetting a reduction in acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities of $74.1 million, a decrease in depreciation and amortization of $27.7 million, and a decline in performance-based compensation expenses of $17.3 million.\nFiscal 2019 income from operations of $287.0 million increased $200.1 million primarily due to the increase in operating profit of our local media segment of $91.7 million resulting from the cyclical nature of political advertising, the addition of operating income from Time of $79.7 million, and a reduction in acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities of $69.2 million.\nNon-operating Income (Expense), net\nFiscal 2020 net non-operating expense was $1.3 million as compared to fiscal 2019 net non-operating income of $24.2 million. The change was primarily due to an increase in pension settlement charges of $16.4 million and the reduction in the pension and other postretirement plans benefit credits $10.7 million.\nNet non-operating income was $24.2 million in fiscal 2019, an increase of $23.5 million from $0.7 million in fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the pension and other postretirement plans benefit credit and a gain on the sale of the Company's 30 percent interest in Charleston Tennis, which was sold in September 2018.\nInterest Expense, net\nNet interest expense was $145.8 million in fiscal 2020, $170.6 million in fiscal 2019, and $97.2 million in fiscal 2018. Average long-term debt outstanding was $2.4 billion in fiscal 2020, $2.7 billion in fiscal 2019, and $1.9 billion in fiscal 2018. The Company's approximate weighted average interest rate was 6.1 percent in fiscal 2020, 7.1 percent in fiscal 2019, and 5.1 percent in fiscal 2018. The weighted average interest rates include the effects of extinguishment losses during fiscal 2019 and 2018, and derivative financial instruments until their termination in January 2018.\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $10.9 million of extinguishment losses related to the early payment of debt and repricing of its senior secured term loan (Term Loan B). During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Company's acquisition of Time, the Company repaid and terminated Meredith's existing indebtedness. In connection with the payoff of this indebtedness, Meredith recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.2 million. In conjunction with the repayment of its debt, the Company also settled the associated interest rate swap agreements and recognized a gain on the settlement of $1.6 million. In addition, the Company incurred $17.5 million in fees that were recorded in interest expense related to an undrawn bridge loan commitment fee.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 13.3 percent in fiscal 2020, 8.2 percent in fiscal 2019, and 1,282.4 percent in fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2020, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $32.2 million for an effective rate of 13.3 percent. The fiscal 2020 effective tax rate was impacted primarily by the national media goodwill impairment charge. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $252.7 million\nto reduce the carrying value of goodwill. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $26.9 million related to this goodwill impairment charge.\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company recorded income tax expense of $11.5 million for an effective rate of 8.2 percent. The fiscal 2019 effective tax rate was primarily impacted by a credit to income taxes of $23.5 million related to write-off of worthless stock and related bad debt. For fiscal 2018, Meredith recorded a tax benefit of $123.6 million primarily reflecting the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities and a reduced tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. This tax benefit was offset in part by non-deductible expenses including transaction costs.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Act, which significantly changed previous U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and other changes such as bonus depreciation that allows for full expensing of qualified property and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and certain executive compensation. For fiscal 2018, the change in the corporate tax rate resulted in a blended U.S. federal statutory rate for the Company of 28.1 percent.\nIn connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we recorded a provisional net tax benefit of $133.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2018. This net benefit primarily consists of a benefit for the corporate rate reduction. As the Company was projecting a net operating loss for the year ended June 30, 2018, deferred tax assets and liabilities expected to be recognized in the year ended June 30, 2018, were remeasured using the 21 percent U.S. corporate tax rate. Any legislative changes, as well as any other new or proposed Treasury regulations to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, may result in additional income tax impacts, which could be material in the period any such changes are enacted.\nEarnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations and Earnings (Loss) per Share from Continuing Operations\nThe loss from continuing operations was $209.0 million ($9.85 per diluted share) for the year ended June 30, 2020, compared to earnings from continuing operations of $129.1 million ($1.12 per diluted share) in the prior year. The current year losses reflect the non-cash impairment charges of $389.3 million ($327.6 million after tax) recorded in fiscal 2020. Absent impairment charges in both years, fiscal 2020 earnings from continuing operations would have been $118.6 million, a decrease of 26 percent from fiscal 2019 earnings from continuing operations of $160.3 million. This decrease is primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower political advertising revenues partially offset by ongoing cost-savings.\nFiscal 2019 earnings from continuing operations were $129.1 million ($1.12 per diluted share) compared to earnings from continuing operations of $114.0 million ($1.79 per diluted share) for fiscal 2018. The increase in earnings from continuing operations is primarily due to the growth in income from operations as discussed above partially offset by the tax benefit recorded in fiscal 2018 due to the Tax Act and an increase in interest expense.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes\nLoss from discontinued operations represents the results of operations and gain/loss on the sales, net of income taxes, of the properties that were held-for-sale during fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019, and fiscal 2018. The revenues and expenses of Sports Illustrated; FanSided, a Sports Illustrated brand marketed separately from Sports Illustrated; and the Company's investments in Viant and Xumo, which were sold in fiscal 2020, were included in loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss) for the fiscal 2020 period prior to their sales.\nThe fiscal 2019 loss from discontinued operations represents the operating results of the TIME and Fortune brands until their respective sale dates; the operations of Sports Illustrated as the Company continued to operate the brand until its second close date in fiscal 2020, and its related impairment charge; and the operations of the properties that were held-for-sale as of June 30, 2019.\nFor fiscal 2018, the loss from discontinued operations represents the operating results of Golf Magazine until the date it was sold and the associated loss on its sale; the operating results of TIUK until the date it was sold and the associated loss on its sale; and the operations of the properties that were held-for-sale as of June 30, 2018.\nThe revenues and expenses for each of these properties have, along with associated income taxes, been removed from continuing operations and reclassified into a single line item on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss) titled loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, as follows:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended June 30,\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>423.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses\n</td> <td>(108.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(408.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(242.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td>(16.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on disposal\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>(23.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(82.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss per common share from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.56\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.83\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>(0.56\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.82\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Earnings (Loss) and Earnings (Loss) per Share\nThe net loss was $234.3 million in fiscal 2020, compared to net earnings of $46.3 million in the prior year. Primarily due to the effects of preferred stock dividends payable on redemption of the preferred stock, the Company had a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $476.0 million ($10.41 per diluted common share) for the year ended June 30, 2020, and a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $32.0 million ($0.70 per diluted common share) for fiscal 2019. The current year losses reflect the non-cash impairment charges of $389.3 million ($327.6 million after tax) recorded in fiscal 2020. Absent the impairment charges in both years, fiscal 2020 net earnings would have been $93.3 million, an increase of 20 percent from the prior year net earnings of $77.5 million. The increase reflects previously executed restructuring activities and ongoing cost-savings initiatives reducing operating expenses and smaller losses on discontinued operations partially offset by a reduction in revenues. Both basic average common shares outstanding and diluted average common shares outstanding increased in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019.\nNet earnings were $46.3 million in fiscal 2019, down 53 percent from net earnings in fiscal 2018 of $99.4 million. The decrease in net earnings was primarily due to there being income tax expense in fiscal 2019 as compared to an income tax benefit recorded in fiscal 2018, increased interest expense, and an increase in the loss from discontinued operations. Due to the effects of other participating securities, the Company had a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $32.0 million ($0.70 per diluted share) in fiscal 2019 compared to net earnings attributable to common shareholders of $66.4 million ($1.47 per diluted share) for fiscal 2018. Both basic average common shares outstanding and diluted average common shares outstanding increased in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended June 30,\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows from operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>306.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows from investing activities\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>374.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,616.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows from financing activities\n</td> <td>(216.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,013.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,917.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in cash held-for-sale\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(392.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>415.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>437.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt\n</td> <td>3,045.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,370.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,195.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>388.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>974.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,097.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt to total capitalization\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOVERVIEW\nMeredith's primary source of liquidity is cash generated by operating activities. Debt financing is typically used for significant acquisitions. Our core businesses-magazine advertising, digital advertising, and television broadcasting-have been strong cash generators. Despite the introduction of many new technologies, we believe these businesses will continue to have strong market appeal for the foreseeable future. As is true in any business, changes in the level of demand for magazine, digital, and television advertising or our other products as well as changes in costs can have a significant effect on operating results and cash flows.\nHistorically, Meredith has been able to absorb normal business downturns without significant increases in debt and management believes the Company will continue to do so. We expect cash on hand, internally generated cash flow, and available credit from financing agreements will provide adequate funds for operating and recurring cash needs (e.g., working capital, capital expenditures, and debt repayments) into the foreseeable future. At June 30, 2020, we had up to $346.9 million available under our revolving credit facility. While there are no guarantees that we will be able to replace current credit agreements when they expire, we expect to be able to do so.\nSOURCES AND USES OF CASH\nCash and cash equivalents increased $87.4 million in fiscal 2020, decreased $392.6 million in fiscal 2019, and increased $415.3 million in fiscal 2018. Over the three-year period, net cash provided by operating activities was used for acquisitions, debt repayments, dividends, stock repurchases, and capital investments.\nOperating Activities\nThe largest single component of operating cash inflows is cash received from advertising customers. Advertising related revenue accounted for approximately 50 percent of total revenues in each of the past three fiscal years. Other sources of operating cash inflows include cash received from magazine circulation sales, retransmission consent fees, affinity marketing, brand licensing, and product sales. Operating cash outflows include payments to vendors and employees and payments of interest and income taxes. Our most significant vendor payments are for production and delivery of publications and promotional mailings, network programming fees, employee benefits (including pension plans), broadcast programming rights, and other services and supplies.\nCash provided by operating activities totaled $306.6 million in fiscal 2020 compared with $245.3 million in fiscal 2019. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to working capital improvements and a reduction in cash paid for severance and integration costs.\nCash provided by operating activities totaled $245.3 million in fiscal 2019 compared with $149.9 million in fiscal 2018. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increased earnings in our local media segment primarily due to increased political spot advertising and a reduction in transaction costs. These increases were partially offset by increases in cash paid for interest, severance, and integration costs.\nChanges in the Company's cash contributions to qualified defined benefit pension plans can have a significant effect on cash provided by operations. We did not make a pension contribution to our domestic plans in fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019, or fiscal 2018. We do not anticipate a required contribution for the domestic pension plans in fiscal 2021.\nIn connection with the sale of TIUK in fiscal 2018, we contributed \u00a360 million to the IPC Plan defined benefit pension plan in the U.K. From February 2018 through June 2020, we made a required \u00a30.9 million per month contribution to the IPC Plan. We expect to continue to make the required \u00a30.9 million per month contribution through fiscal 2021. In the event that on November 25, 2021, the IPC Plan has a funding deficit valuing its liabilities with a gilts plus 50 basis point discount rate, the Company, as the sponsor of the IPC Plan, will make a contribution equal to that funding deficit. In the event that on November 25, 2025, the IPC Plan has a funding deficit valuing its liabilities with a gilts flat discount rate, the Company will make a contribution equal to 50 percent of that funding deficit. In the event that on November 25, 2026, the IPC Plan has a funding deficit valuing its liabilities with a gilts flat discount rate, the Company will make a contribution equal to 50 percent of that funding deficit. In the event that on November 25, 2027, the IPC Plan has a funding deficit valuing its liabilities with a gilts flat discount rate, the Company will make a contribution equal to that funding deficit. Contributions shall cease to be payable from the date that the IPC Plan is confirmed to be fully funded.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting cash inflows generally include proceeds from the sale of assets or a business. Investing cash outflows generally include payments for the acquisition of new businesses; investments; and additions to property, plant, and equipment.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $3.1 million in fiscal 2020 due to proceeds from the sale of the Money and FanSided brands and our interests in Viant and Xumo. These proceeds were almost entirely offset by cash paid for acquisitions and capital expenditures. Net cash provided by investing activities was $374.3 million in fiscal 2019 due to proceeds from the sale of TIME, Fortune, and our remaining interest in Charleston Tennis LLC and proceeds received in advance of the sale of Sports Illustrated.\nNet cash provided by investing activities increased to $374.3 million in fiscal 2019 primarily due to proceeds from the sale of TIME, Fortune, and our remaining interest in Charleston Tennis LLC and proceeds received in advance of the sale of Sports Illustrated. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018 primarily due to the acquisition of Time partially offset by cash received from the sales of TIUK and MXM.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing cash inflows generally include borrowings under debt agreements and proceeds from the exercise of common stock options issued under share-based compensation plans. Financing cash outflows generally include the repayment of long-term debt, repurchases of Company stock, the payment of dividends, and the payment of acquisition-related contingent consideration.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $216.7 million in fiscal 2020, compared to $1.0 billion in the prior year. The reduction in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to $675.0 million of net debt issuances in fiscal\n2020 as compared to $827.0 million of net debt repayments in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2020, we paid $722.0 million to redeem our Series A preferred stock and $26.6 million in original issue discount and debt issuance costs, which offset the net debt proceeds received in fiscal 2020.\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $1.0 billion in fiscal 2019, compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $2.9 billion in fiscal 2018. The change in cash flows from financing activities is primarily due to $827.0 million of net debt repayments in fiscal 2019, compared to $2.5 billion of net debt issuances in fiscal 2018. In addition, $631.0 million of preferred equity was issued in fiscal 2018. The debt and preferred equity issuances were related to the acquisition of Time.\nLong-term Debt\nAt June 30, 2020, total long-term debt outstanding was $3.1 billion consisting of $1.5 billion under variable-rate term loans and $1.6 billion in fixed-rate senior notes.\nThe variable-rate credit facility includes the Term Loan B and an incremental secured term loan (Incremental Term Loan) with $1.1 billion and $410.0 million of aggregate principal, respectively, and a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility of $350.0 million, of which $175.0 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit and $35.0 million of swingline loans. On June 30, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. There were $3.1 million of standby letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility resulting in availability of $346.9 million at June 30, 2020. The Incremental Term Loan amortizes at 1.0 percent per annum in equal quarterly installments until the final maturity date, which is in 2025, at which time the remaining principal on the Term Loan B will also mature. The interest rate under the Term Loan B is based on LIBOR plus 2.50 percent and bore interest at a rate of 3.26 percent at June 30, 2020. The interest rate under the Incremental Term Loan is based on LIBOR plus 4.25 percent with a floor of 1.00 percent for LIBOR and bore interest at a rate of 5.25 percent at June 30, 2020.\nOur credit agreements include a financial covenant that is applicable based on a certain utilization level of the revolving credit line. Failure to comply with this covenant could result in the debt becoming payable on demand. The covenant did not apply at June 30, 2020, as we were below the specified utilization level on the revolving credit line. The revolving credit facility was amended in June 2020, and certain covenants and terms were modified during the Covenant Relief Period, which is effective until March 31, 2022. During the Covenant Relief Period, the revolving credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 2.50 percent to 3.50 percent. After the Covenant Relief Period, the revolving credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 2.50 percent to 3.00 percent. It also has a commitment fee ranging from 0.375 percent to 0.500 percent of the unused commitment. All interest rates and commitment fees associated with this variable-rate revolving credit facility are derived from a leverage-based pricing grid. The fixed-rate Senior Notes include the 2026 Unsecured Senior Notes with $1.3 billion of aggregate principal and the 2025 Secured Senior Notes with $300.0 million of aggregate principal. The Senior Unsecured Notes mature in 2026 with an interest rate of 6.875 percent per annum, and the Senior Secured Notes mature in 2025 with an interest rate of 6.50 percent per annum. Total outstanding principal is due at the final maturity dates.\nPreferred Stock\nOn January 31, 2018, in exchange for a preferred equity investment of $650.0 million, Meredith issued 650,000 shares of Series A preferred stock as well as detachable warrants to purchase up to 1,625,000 shares of Meredith's common stock with an exercise price of $1.00 per share and options to purchase up to 875,000 shares of Meredith's common stock with an exercise price of $70.50 per share. On June 30, 2020, the Company redeemed all its outstanding Series A preferred stock. The detachable warrants and options continue to be outstanding as of June 30, 2020.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of June 30, 2020:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,045.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,460.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,572.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt interest 1\n</td> <td>858.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>291.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Broadcast rights and network programming\n</td> <td>707.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>451.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>673.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>371.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing leases\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent consideration 2\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations and other\n</td> <td>126.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit plans\n</td> <td>368.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liability to Time Warner 3\n</td> <td>28.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,818.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>592.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,034.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,956.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,236.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>Debt interest represents semi-annual interest payments due on fixed-rate Senior Notes and estimated interest payments on variable-rate term loans outstanding at June 30, 2020.

Therefore, $53.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes.\nPurchase obligations represent legally binding agreements to purchase goods and services that specify all significant terms. Outstanding purchase orders, which represent authorizations to purchase goods and services but are not legally binding, are not included in purchase obligations. We believe current cash balances, cash generated by future operating activities, and cash available under existing credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our contractual cash obligations and other operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future. Projections of future cash flows are, however, subject to substantial uncertainty as discussed throughout MD&A and particularly in Item 1A - Risk Factors beginning on page 13. Debt agreements may be renewed or refinanced if we determine it is advantageous to do so. We also have commitments in the form of standby letters of credit totaling $3.1 million that expire within one year.\nShare Repurchase Program\nWe have maintained a program of Company share repurchases for 32 years. In fiscal 2020, we spent $4.7 million to repurchase an aggregate of 120,000 shares of Meredith common and class B stock at then current market prices. We spent $10.0 million to repurchase an aggregate of 190,000 shares in fiscal 2019 and $31.1 million to repurchase an aggregate of 520,000 shares in fiscal 2018.\nWe expect to continue repurchasing shares from time to time subject to market conditions. In May 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million in additional shares of the Company's stock through public and private transactions. As of June 30, 2020, $46.6 million remained available under the current authorization for future repurchases. See Item 5 - Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this Form 10-K for detailed information on share repurchases during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. Pursuant to the terms of our debt facilities, we may be subject to certain limitations with respect to our ability to conduct share repurchases, as further discussed under Item 1A - Risk Factors.\nDividends\nMeredith had paid quarterly dividends continuously since 1947, and we increased our dividend annually for 27 consecutive years. The last increase occurred in February 2020 when the Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of 0.595 cents per share effective with the dividend payable in March 2020. However, in April 2020, we announced that in response to uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, Meredith paused the common and class B stock dividends. The Board remains committed to paying a dividend in the future when circumstances permit and will consider the following factors, among others, when evaluating the Company's dividend policy going forward: seeing a path to economic recovery, including recovery of the advertising market, evaluating the Company's cash flow needs to support future growth, and ensuring compliance with terms of the Company's debt agreements.\nDividend payments on common and class B stock totaled $83.0 million, or $1.745 per share, in fiscal 2020 compared with $106.0 million, or $2.240 per share, in fiscal 2019, and $98.6 million, or $2.130 per share, in fiscal 2018. The Series A preferred stock was paid a quarterly dividend at a rate of 8.5 percent per annum. As the Series A preferred stock was redeemed in June 2020, there will be no future dividend payments. Dividend payments on the Series A preferred stock totaled $56.5 million in fiscal 2020, $55.9 million fiscal 2019, and $22.9 million in fiscal 2018.\nPursuant to the terms of our debt facilities, we may be subject to certain limitations with respect to our ability to pay dividends on our stock, as further discussed under Item 1A - Risk Factors.\nCapital Expenditures\nSpending for property, plant, and equipment totaled $55.4 million in fiscal 2020, $46.4 million in fiscal 2019, and $53.2 million in fiscal 2018. Spending for all fiscal years primarily related to assets acquired in the normal course of business. The Company incurred $2.3 million in fiscal 2020, $6.0 million in fiscal 2019, and $6.3 million in fiscal 2018, related to the spectrum repack required by the FCC. We anticipate spending an additional $0.5 million in fiscal 2021 to complete the repack. We received reimbursements from the FCC's special fund of $5.5 million in fiscal 2020 and $6.1 million in fiscal 2019, respectively, and expect to receive additional reimbursements to cover the majority of our capital costs and expense related to the repacking. While we expect to receive all reimbursements submitted, we cannot predict that the fund will be sufficient to reimburse all of our expenses related to the repacking and the timing of reimbursement or any spectrum-related FCC regulatory action. We have no material commitments for future capital expenditures. We expect funds for future capital expenditures to come from operating activities or, if necessary, borrowings under credit agreements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the years presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nGuarantor Financial Information\nThe 2026 Unsecured Senior Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of Meredith Corporation (Parent Issuer) and are guaranteed on a full, unconditional, joint, and several basis, by the combined Guarantor Subsidiaries.\u201d The other subsidiaries (the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries) of the Company do not guarantee the 2026 Unsecured Senior\nNotes.

Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Some of these estimates and assumptions are inherently difficult to make and subjective in nature. We base our estimates on historical experience, recent trends, our expectations for future performance, and other assumptions as appropriate. We reevaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis; actual results, however, may vary from these estimates.\nThe following are the accounting policies that management believes are most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. In addition, there are other items within the consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed to be critical accounting policies. Changes in the estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe Company has a significant amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that are reviewed at least annually for impairment. At June 30, 2020, goodwill and intangible assets totaled $3.4 billion, or 61 percent of Meredith's total assets, with $2.6 billion in the national media segment and $0.8 billion in the local media segment. The impairment analyses of these assets are considered critical because of their significance to the Company and our national media and local media segments.\nManagement is required to evaluate goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis or when events occur or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying value exceeds the fair value. In reviewing goodwill for impairment, the Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.\nMeredith uses the discounted cash flow and guideline public company methods for determining fair value. The Company selected 60 percent weighting of the discounted cash flow and 40 percent weighting of the guideline public company methods as the valuation approach to estimate fair value. The discounted cash flow model requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions to estimate the future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit or to result from the use of the assets. These estimates depend upon assumptions about future revenues (including projections of overall market growth and our share of market), estimated costs, and appropriate discount rates. Our assumptions are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and a variety of external sources and are consistent with the assumptions used in both our short-term financial forecasts and long-term strategic plans. Future cash flow projections can vary within a range of outcomes depending on the assumptions and estimates used.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company determined that interim triggering events, including declines in the price of its stock and the economic downturn caused by COVID-19 required an interim evaluation of goodwill at March 31, 2020. The impairment test determined the carrying value of goodwill in the national media segment exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $252.7 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the national media segment in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $26.9 million related to this goodwill impairment charge. In addition, during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company experienced revenue declines, primarily related to advertising, as advertisers faced economic challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These declines caused the Company to revise forecasts and to determine that it had a triggering event to test the value of intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment as of March 31, 2020. As a result, the national media segment recorded non-cash impairment charges of $21.2 million to partially impair certain national media segment trademarks. In addition, the local media segment recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $22.3 million to partially impair one of its FCC licenses. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company also recorded an impairment charge of $5.2 million on a national media trademark. The fair values of the trademarks are determined based on significant inputs not observable in the market. The Company performed its fiscal 2020 annual impairment review for the national media and local media reporting units using qualitative assessments as of its measurement date of May 31, 2020. Based on the results of the assessments, there was no further indication of impairment.\nAs goodwill and intangible assets of the national media reporting unit were written down to their estimated fair values as of March 31, 2020, those amounts are more susceptible to risk of impairment if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate. Changes in key assumptions about the national media and local media businesses and their prospects or changes in market conditions could result in an impairment charge. See Item 1A.-Risk Factors for other factors that could affect our assumptions.\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company's decisions to discontinue the print publication of Money and transition Coastal Living from a subscription magazine to a newsstand only title resulted in the impairment of these trademarks. The lack of sales growth resulted in the carrying value of the trademarks for the Shape and Family Circle brands to exceed their fair values. Accordingly, at May 31, 2019, the national media segment recorded non-cash impairments charge of\n$41.8 million to fully impair the Money and Coastal Living brand trademarks and to partially impair the Shape and Family Circle brand trademarks.\nDuring fiscal 2018, Meredith made the strategic decision to no longer publish Fit Pregnancy and Baby magazine as a standalone title, rather include it as a feature within Parents magazine and to discontinue FamilyFun as a subscription title and instead publish it only for sale on the newsstand. These decisions were determined to be triggering events requiring Meredith to evaluate the trademarks within our Parents Network for impairment. As a result of those analyses, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $22.7 million related to those trademarks.\nSee Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nINCOME TAXES\nIncome taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable for the current year and for the impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which represent future tax consequences of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using the enacted statutory tax rates and are adjusted for any changes in such rates in the period of change. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe tax benefit in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the tax effect of the impairment charges for national media goodwill. As a result, Meredith's tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 13.3 percent. Net deferred tax liabilities totaled $463.8 million, or 9 percent of total liabilities, at June 30, 2020.\nWe consider accounting for income taxes critical to our operations because management is required to make significant subjective judgments in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities, any valuation allowances that may be required against deferred tax assets, and reserves for uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company operates in numerous taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in each of these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues that tend to require an extended period of time to resolve and may eventually result in an increase or decrease to amounts previously paid to the taxing jurisdictions. Any such audits are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS\nADOPTED OR PENDING ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nAccounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases, became effective for the Company on July 1, 2019. The adoption of the update had a material impact on our consolidated financial position, but did not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.\nThere were no other new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year which have had or are expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021, while the Company is still completing its assessment, we do not expect that the adoption of the new credit losses standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information related to our adoption of new accounting standards and for information on our anticipated adoption of recently issued accounting standards.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am unable to identify the information you are requesting.\n- Can you provide additional details or

The national media segment also features robust brand licensing activities, including more than 3,000 SKUs of branded products at 4,000 Walmart stores across the U.S. and at Walmart.com. The national media segment also includes leading affinity marketer Synapse, and The Foundry 360, the Company's state-of-the-art creative lab and content studio.\nMeredith's local media segment includes 17 television stations in 12 markets reaching 11 percent of U.S. households and nearly 30 million viewers. Meredith's portfolio is concentrated in large, fast-growing markets, with seven stations in the nation's Top 25 markets-including Atlanta, Phoenix, St. Louis, and Portland-and 13 in the Top 50. Meredith's stations produce 745 hours of local news and entertainment content each week and operate leading local digital destinations. The local media segment also includes MNI, which delivers targeted advertising solutions to more than 1,200 clients on a local, regional, and national level.\nBoth segments operate primarily in the U.S. and compete against similar media and other types of media on both a local and national basis. In fiscal 2020, the national media segment accounted for 73 percent of the Company's $2.8 billion in revenues while local media segment revenues contributed 27 percent.\nThe Company accomplished a number of initiatives during fiscal 2020, including increasing brand engagement with consumers and advertisers and improving our competitive position. Highlights include:\nFirst, in fiscal 2020 we added to our digital businesses and capabilities. For example:\n \u2022 We built a new technology platform with robust data capabilities supporting our expanding digital activities. This new proprietary platform, which unifies legacy platforms onto the same technology stack, includes not only our content management system, but also our proprietary taxonomy, our first-party data, and our user identity graph. This prepares us well for a world where third party cookies are no longer supported. \nIt also allows us to bring together consumer profiles, real-time insights, and intent signals to predict trends that inform our editorial and product roadmap, provide more personalized experiences to our consumers, and give advertisers the ability to tailor the right messages and products to the users most likely to buy at any given time.\n \u2022 We advanced our video and audio strategies. Video views grew more than 50 percent in fiscal 2020 across our owned and operated properties. Responding to consumer demand, we published a third more videos during fiscal 2020. We also launched a series of new podcasts under the Allrecipes, Southern Living, and Parents brands as a way to tell stories in an increasingly popular way. We have more planned, including a new People podcast. \n \u2022 We added to our subscription acquisition and e-commerce capabilities, which are important avenues for growth. Meredith first entered the e-commerce space with the acquisition of ShopNation seven years ago. Since then, revenue growth from our e-commerce activities, including digital couponing, content, and affiliate commerce, has been exceptionally strong - up 28 percent in fiscal 2020. \nSecond, we launched a series of new brands, product expansions, and re-alignments to improve profitability in fiscal 2020. In our national media operations, we:\n \u2022 Launched Reveal, a new lifestyle magazine partnering with Property Brothers television show hosts Drew and Jonathan Scott; Sweet July, with best-selling author, restaurateur, and television host Ayesha Curry; and a new multimedia personal finance brand Millie that is dedicated to helping women achieve their financial goals. \n \u2022 Re-aligned several brands in our national media portfolio to improve efficiency. This included closing Family Circle magazine and transitioning Rachael Ray Every Day to a premium newsstand title published on a quarterly basis. This strategy has proven successful with other of our brands, including Coastal Living, Cooking Light, and Traditional Home. The latter three brands are now also offering subscriptions at a higher price point than under the previous advertising-driven model. \n \u2022 Completed the last of our planned asset sales. This included the Money brand, FanSided, and Meredith's interests in Viant and Xumo. \nIn our local media operations, we:\n \u2022 Launched two national television shows based on the People and Southern Living brands. People Now was a weekend program during fiscal 2020 and is expected to become a daily primetime show across our network in early fiscal 2021. Similarly, Southern Living has been expanded to weekly syndication. Leveraging our leading brands across additional platforms is an exciting opportunity and something we hope to scale over time. \n \u2022 Continued to expand news production and are now producing 745 hours of local content each week. We have seen significant growth in ratings as a result of consumer interest in local news during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nWe pursued a number of initiatives in fiscal 2020 to grow engagement and revenues from the more than 190 million U.S. consumers who regularly interact with our brands. In these challenging times, consumers are looking to Meredith's trusted brands for important news and information, practical advice, home improvement ideas, recipes, inspiration, and moments of escape.\nIn our national media operations:\n \u2022 Visits to our digital brands grew by 14 percent in our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter compared to the prior-year period, driven by strong growth in brands focused on food, health, and home lifestyle categories that give Meredith access to an extremely wide audience. These include Allrecipes, Shape, and Martha Stewart. \n \u2022 Our licensing and digital and other consumer driven revenues grew 8 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and 12 percent in fiscal 2020. This growth was driven primarily by Apple News + royalties, e-commerce, and our performance marketing activities. It also included stronger sales of our branded products at retail - particularly our Better Homes & Gardens line at Walmart. \n \u2022 Our magazine business is the largest in the United States, reaching more than 120 million women. This is nearly 95 percent of women and is one of our most powerful points of differentiation. People is the industry's largest brand, reaching nearly 90 million unduplicated consumers. Allrecipes, which has seen strong consumer growth with an acceleration due to COVID-19, is now the industry's No. 2 brand. Better Homes & Gardens is also in the top 10. On average, we sell approximately 70 magazines brands at newsstand and more than 30 subscriptions every minute. \n \u2022 We continued to see strong growth in various subscription channels that drive high lifetime subscriber value in our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. These include our owned and operated digital properties, paid search, direct mail, and renewal campaigns. For example: \n \u25e6 Demand via our digital and partner networks is strong. Since mid-March, we have seen consistent year-over-year growth with conversion rates 50 percent higher than normal. \n \u25e6 Traditional magazine subscription acquisition and renewal efforts for all of our major titles are up strongly as well. For example, two direct mail campaigns for the People brand are performing more than 50 percent above targets, and a campaign for Southern Living is performing at twice our expectations. In addition, renewals are pacing well above historical trends. \n \u25e6 Our newsstand business, Meredith Premium Publishing, produces 300 special interest issues annually at prices ranging from $10 to $15. Our strong consumer data capability and high-quality brands are competitive advantages, giving us the ability to adapt quickly to changing trends and produce content consumers want under brands that have strong consumer recognition. During Fiscal 2020, we added almost 20 percent more magazine pockets at newsstand, bringing our total to 1.9 million. \nIn our local media operations:\n \u2022 Our television stations' focus on their individual markets drove strong ratings performance throughout the fiscal year. For example, during the July 2020 rating period, our stations in 7 of our 12 markets ranked No. 1 or No. 2 from sign-on to sign-off. It also drove digital results, as the number of visits to our local media sites grew 18 percent in fiscal 2020. \n \u2022 We grew retransmission revenues by 10 percent in fiscal 2020 as we renewed nearly 60 percent of our retransmission consent relationships and all our CBS affiliations. \nNATIONAL MEDIA\nAdvertising related revenues made up 48 percent of fiscal 2020 national media revenues. These revenues were generated from the sale of advertising space in our magazines and on our digital properties to clients interested in promoting their brands, products, and services to consumers as well as revenue we generate selling advertising space on third-party platforms. Changes in advertising related revenues tend to correlate with changes in the level of economic activity in the U.S. Indicators of economic activity include changes in the level of gross domestic product, consumer spending, housing starts, unemployment rates, auto sales, and interest rates. Circulation levels of Meredith's magazines, reader demographic data, and the advertising rates charged relative to other comparable available advertising opportunities also affect the level of advertising related revenues.\nConsumer related revenues accounted for 48 percent of fiscal 2020 national media revenues. Consumer related revenue includes all revenues either driven by or otherwise linked to consumer buying decisions and include circulation activities; magazine subscriptions sales for third-party publishers; brand licensing; digital lead generation; and other e-commerce sales, product sales, and related activities. Circulation revenues result from the sale of magazines to consumers through subscriptions and by single copy sales on newsstands in print form, primarily at major retailers and grocery/drug stores, and in digital form on tablets and other media devices. In the short term, subscription revenues, which accounted for 61 percent of consumer related revenues, are less susceptible to economic changes because subscriptions are generally sold for terms of one to three years. The same economic factors that affect advertising related revenues also can influence consumers' response to subscription offers and result in lower revenues and/or higher costs to maintain subscriber levels over time. Subscription revenues per copy and related costs can also vary significantly by subscription source. Some subscription sources generate lower revenues than other sources but have proportionately lower related costs. A key factor in our subscription success is our industry-leading database. It contains an abundance of attributes on 180 million individuals, including 90 percent of U.S. millennial women. The size and depth of our database is a key to our circulation model and allows more precise consumer targeting. Newsstand revenues are more volatile than subscription revenues and can vary significantly month-to-month depending on economic and other factors. The remaining consumer related revenues are generally affected by changes in the level of economic activity in the U.S., including changes in the level of gross domestic product, consumer spending, unemployment rates, and interest rates.\nThe remaining 4 percent of national media revenues came from a variety of activities that included the sale of customer relationship marketing products and services. In addition, for certain sold brands, Meredith has provided consumer marketing, subscription fulfillment, paper purchasing, printing, and other services under outsourcing agreements and records such revenue in other revenue.\nNational media's major expense categories are employee compensation costs and production and delivery of publications and promotional mailings. Employee compensation, which includes benefits expense, represented 18 percent of national media's operating expenses in fiscal 2020. Compensation expense is affected by salary and incentive levels, the number of employees, the costs of our various employee benefit plans, and other factors.\nPaper, postage, and production charges represented 17 percent of the segment's operating expenses in fiscal 2020. The price of paper can vary significantly on the basis of worldwide demand and supply for paper in general and for specific types of paper used by Meredith. The printing of our publications is outsourced. We have a multi-year contract for the printing of our magazines, a practice which reduces price fluctuations over the contract term. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the USPS and legislative mandates imposed on the USPS. The USPS adjusted rates most recently in January 2020, which resulted in an increase of approximately 1.9 percent. While we expect postage rates to increase again in January 2021, an ongoing legislatively mandated review of the existing law by the Postal Regulatory Commission could potentially result in adjustments to the current rate-setting regime. Meredith continues to work independently and with others to encourage and help the USPS find and implement efficiencies to contain rate increases.\nImpairment charges accounted for 16 percent of national media's fiscal 2020 expenses. The remaining 49 percent of fiscal 2020 national media expenses included depreciation and amortization, costs for magazine newsstand distribution, advertising and promotional efforts, and overhead costs for facilities and technology services.\nLOCAL MEDIA\nLocal media derives the majority of its revenues-53 percent in fiscal 2020-from the sale of spot advertising on our stations' digital and mobile media properties as well as revenue we generate selling advertising space on third-party platforms. The remainder comes from television retransmission consent fees, television production, and other services.\nThe stations sell advertising to both local/regional and national accounts. Political advertising revenues are cyclical in that they are significantly greater during biennial election campaigns (which take place primarily in odd-numbered fiscal years) than at other times. We generate additional revenues from digital activities and programs focused on local interests such as community events and college and professional sports.\nChanges in advertising related revenues tend to correlate with changes in the level of economic activity in the U.S. and in the local markets in which we operate stations, and with the cyclical changes in political advertising discussed previously. Programming content, audience share, audience demographics, and the advertising rates charged relative to other available advertising opportunities also affect advertising revenues. On occasion, unusual events necessitate uninterrupted television coverage and will adversely affect spot advertising revenues.\nLocal media's major expense categories are programming fees paid to the networks and employee compensation. Programming fees paid to the networks represented 34 percent of this segment's fiscal 2020 expenses. Employee compensation represented 29 percent of local media's operating expenses in fiscal 2020 and is affected by the same factors noted for national media. Sales and promotional activities, costs to produce local news programming, and general overhead costs for facilities and technical resources accounted for most of the remaining 37 percent of local media's fiscal 2020 operating expenses.\nFISCAL 2020 FINANCIAL OVERVIEW\n \u2022 The Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $252.7 million to reduce the carrying value of the national media segment's goodwill. In addition, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $26.4 million to reduce the value of several of the national media segment's trademarks and $22.3 million to reduce the value of one of the local media segment's FCC licenses. \n \u2022 The Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $87.9 million in the national media segment related to vacant leased space at its location in New York City. \n \u2022 The Company estimates that cancellations or delays in advertising campaigns, declines in newsstand sales, and the cancellation of events due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $153.7 million adverse impact on revenues in fiscal 2020. Correspondingly, the Company estimates that operating expenses declined $70.6 million due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \u2022 National media revenues decreased 11 percent primarily due to declines in print advertising and subscription revenues as a result of portfolio changes and a reduction in advertising related and consumer related revenues due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic partially offset by increases in digital and other consumer driven and other revenues. Operating expenses increased primarily due to the goodwill, vacated lease space, and trademark impairment charges noted above. Due primarily to the impairment charges, the national media segment ended fiscal 2020 with an operating loss of $167.7 million. \n \u2022 Local media revenues decreased 11 percent primarily due to declines in high margin political advertising revenues due to the cyclical nature of political advertising and a reduction in non-political and third party advertising related revenues due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating profit declined 48 percent primarily due to lower political advertising revenues and other advertising related revenues and the non-cash impairment charge noted above. \n \u2022 Unallocated corporate expenses decreased $44.9 million primarily due to reductions in integration and exit costs and performance-based compensation expenses. \n \u2022 The Company raised $710 million of new secured debt, and used the proceeds, along with existing cash on hand, to redeem all outstanding Series A preferred stock. \n \u2022 The Company reported a net loss from continuing operations for fiscal 2020 of $209.0 million reflecting the non-cash impairment charges of $389.3 million ($327.6 million after-tax). Absent impairment charges in both years, the Company would have had net earnings from continuing operations of $118.6 million compared to $160.3 million in fiscal 2019, a decline of 26 percent. \n \u2022 In fiscal 2020, we generated $306.6 million in operating cash flows, invested $55.4 million in capital improvements, and invested $23.1 million in acquisitions of and investments in businesses. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nOVERVIEW\nFollowing are brief descriptions of recent material acquisitions and a discussion of the trends and uncertainties that affected our businesses. Following the Overview is an analysis of the results of operations for the national media and local media segments and an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the last three fiscal years.\nAcquisitions\nOn January 31, 2018, Meredith completed its acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Time. As a result, Time became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Meredith. Since February 1, 2018, the first day of operations for the combined company, the operating results of Time have been included in the Company's consolidated operating results. While the majority of Time's operations are reported in Meredith's national media segment, one business unit of Time is reported in Meredith's local media segment and certain expenses are reported in unallocated corporate. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nAs the Company integrated Time, the ability to separately track Time-related revenues and expenses, especially unallocated corporate expenses, became less feasible. Therefore, throughout MD&A reasonable estimates of incremental Time revenues and expenses for fiscal 2019 have been disclosed where possible.\nTrends and Uncertainties\nAdvertising revenues accounted for 49 percent of total revenues in fiscal 2020. Advertising demand is the Company's key uncertainty, and its fluctuation from period to period can have a material effect on operating results. Demand for political advertising in the Company's local media segment is cyclical in nature, generally following the biennial cycle of election campaigns with peaks occurring in our odd fiscal years (e.g., fiscal 2019, fiscal 2021) and particularly in our second quarter of those fiscal years. Other significant uncertainties that can affect operating results include fluctuations in the cost of paper, postage rates, and over time, television programming rights. The Company's cash flows from operating activities, our primary source of liquidity, is adversely affected when the advertising market is weak or when costs rise. One of our priorities is to manage our businesses prudently during expanding and contracting economic cycles to maximize shareholder return over time. To manage the uncertainties inherent in our businesses, we prepare monthly internal forecasts of anticipated results of operations and monitor\nthe economic indicators mentioned in the Executive Overview. See Item 1A - Risk Factors in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nNATIONAL MEDIA\nThe following discussion reviews operating results for our national media segment, which includes magazine publishing, digital and customer relationship marketing, digital and mobile media, affinity marketing, brand licensing, database-related activities, and other related operations. The national media segment contributed 73 percent of Meredith's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2020.\nFiscal 2020 national media revenues declined 11 percent. Costs and expenses decreased 11 percent, and impairment charges of $367.0 million were recorded in the national media segment. Due to the impairment charges, the national media operations reported an operating loss of $167.7 million in fiscal 2020.\nNational media revenues increased 48 percent in fiscal 2019. Operating costs and expenses increased 48 percent. Acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities of $54.3 million and impairment charges of $41.8 million were recorded in the national media segment. Operating profit increased 48 percent primarily due to having a full year of results of the acquired Time business in fiscal 2019.\nNational media operating results for the last three fiscal years were as follows:\n\nRevenues\nThe table below presents the components of national media revenues for the last three fiscal years.\n\nAdvertising Related Revenue\nThe following table presents advertising page information according to MediaRadar, an independent agency that measures advertising sales volume, for our major subscription-based magazines for the last three fiscal years:\n\nNational media advertising related revenue includes all advertising in Meredith owned publications and on Meredith owned websites as well as revenue generated from selling advertising space on third-party platforms. Advertising related revenue decreased 14 percent in fiscal 2020.\nMeredith has made changes to its portfolio of brands and titles intended to enhance the consumer experience, provide more effective and efficient platforms for advertisers, and increase the profitability of the portfolio. These changes included closing the Money, Martha Stewart Weddings, and Family Circle magazines, changing the frequency of Entertainment Weekly to a monthly title, transitioning Coastal Living, Traditional Home, and Rachael Ray Every Day to premium newsstand titles, and merging Cooking Light into Meredith's popular EatingWell title, which resulted in declines in combined print advertising revenues of approximately $60.0 million in fiscal 2020. Of\nthe remaining decline in print advertising revenues of $76.6 million, the Company estimates that advertising cancellations and delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $45.2 million adverse impact in fiscal 2020, with $41.3 million of the decline coming in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. The remaining decrease in print advertising revenues is primarily due to changing market demands for print advertising.\nDigital advertising decreased 5 percent in fiscal 2020. While the Company saw increased digital advertising revenues during the first eight months of fiscal 2020, the Company estimates that cancellations and delays in digital advertising revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $33.0 million adverse impact in fiscal 2020 with $27.0 million of this impact occurring in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nThe 3 percent decrease in third party sales was primarily due to reductions in cover wrap sales as well as decreases in advertising pages in publications the Company produces on behalf of others. The Company estimates that cancellations and delays in digital third party sales due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $3.5 million adverse impact during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nWhile the Company is not able to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenues into fiscal 2021, the Company is seeing improvement in advertising related revenues into the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and, if the economy continues to recover, the Company expects this trend to continue into fiscal 2021. Future actions such as renewed shelter-in-place or business closing orders could negatively impact these expectations.\nNational media advertising related revenue increased 48 percent in fiscal 2019. The increase in print advertising was primarily due to the addition of print advertising revenues of Time partially offset by a 10 percent decline in comparative print advertising revenues. Approximately 30 percent of the decline in comparative print advertising revenue was due to changes to the marketing of Fit Pregnancy and Baby and Family Fun magazines. While the women's service category of titles saw a slight increase in print advertising revenues, the lifestyle and parenthood categories saw declines. Digital advertising increased primarily due to the addition of digital advertising revenues of Time. Comparative digital advertising revenues increased 14 percent in fiscal 2019. The increase in third party sales was primarily due to the addition of Time.\nConsumer Related Revenue\nConsumer related revenue includes all revenues either driven by or otherwise linked to consumer buying decisions. Fiscal 2020 consumer related revenues declined 9 percent as compared to the prior year.\nApproximately 65 percent of the decline in subscription revenue was due to the portfolio changes detailed above. In addition, a trade book line of business was closed, which resulted in a $5.4 million decrease in subscription revenue in fiscal 2020. The remaining decrease in subscription revenue in fiscal 2020 was due primarily to a change in mix to subscriptions received directly by the Company. Subscriptions received directly by the Company tend to have lower subscription revenues, lower acquisition costs, and higher renewal rates. Digital and other consumer driven revenue increased primarily due to increases in ecommerce revenues from direct product sales and lead generation referrals. The Company estimates that shelter-in-place orders and reductions in travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $17.6 million adverse impact on newsstand revenues in the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2020.\nConsumer related revenue increased 69 percent in fiscal 2019. The increases in subscription and newsstand revenues were primarily due to the addition of subscription revenues of Time partially offset by approximately 10 percent declines in comparative subscription and newsstand revenues. Digital and other consumer driven revenue increased primarily due to the growth in e-commerce revenues. The increases in the remaining categories of consumer related revenue were primarily due to the addition of Time revenues.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue increased 15 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the delivery of episodes of a streaming program created for a third party. The Company estimates that the cancellation of events sponsored by the Company due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $9.0 million adverse impact on other revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nFiscal 2019 other revenue decreased 48 percent primarily due to declines of $83.6 million in Meredith Xcelerated Marketing (MXM) revenues due to the sale of MXM in fiscal 2018.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nNational media operating costs and expenses decreased 11 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower combined production, distribution, and paper costs of $86.4 million, a reduction in employee-related compensation costs of $54.1 million, a decline in non-payroll editorial costs of $48.0 million, and a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $30.0 million.\nThe Company estimates the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a reduction in national media operating costs and expenses of $52.8 million in fiscal 2020, relating to reductions in production, distribution, editorial, employee-related compensation, performance-based compensation expenses, and selling expenses.\nWhile the Company is not able to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operating costs and expenses into fiscal 2021, the Company expects that to the extent advertising related revenues recover, related direct costs and expenses will also increase.\nFiscal 2019 national media costs and expenses increased 48 percent primarily due to the addition of Time operating costs and expenses of $767.4 million and an increase in employee compensation and related costs of $24.0 million partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of MXM of $86.9 million and a reduction in circulation expenses of $18.2 million.\nAcquisition, Disposition, and Restructuring Related Activities\nNational media acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities decreased $51.9 million in fiscal 2020 primarily due to declines in severance and related benefit expenses of $36.7 million and a reduction in integration costs of $18.3 million.\nFiscal 2019 national media acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities increased 26 percent primarily due to an increase in integration costs of $21.8 million partially offset by a decrease in severance and related benefit expenses of $12.3 million.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the national media segment recorded a non-cash impairment of goodwill of $252.7 million, non-cash impairments of an operating lease asset and associated leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures totaling $87.9 million, and non-cash impairments of trademarks of $21.2 million. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the national media segment recorded a $5.2 million non-cash impairment of a trademark. The magnitude of the impairments of goodwill and other long-lived assets recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was unfavorably impacted by the recent volatility of the financial markets and the uncertainty surrounding the long-term economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe national media segment recorded non-cash impairment charges of $41.8 million in fiscal 2019 related to trademarks.\nOperating Profit (Loss)\nNational media operations resulted in a $167.7 million loss in fiscal 2020 reflecting the $367.0 million non-cash impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets. Absent the impairment charges in both years, national media operating profit would have been $199.3 million, an increase of 19 percent when compared to $167.8 million in fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to previously executed restructuring activities and ongoing cost-savings initiatives reducing operating expenses partially offset by a reduction in revenues as discussed above.\nFiscal 2019 national media operating profit grew to $126.0 million primarily due to operating income from Time of $79.1 million and an increase in the profit contribution of our digital consumer products operations of $7.6 million partially offset by a $33.9 million decrease in the profit contribution of our magazine operations and an increase in the impairment of trademarks of $19.1 million.\nLOCAL MEDIA\nThe following discussion reviews operating results for the Company's local media segment, which consists of 17 television stations and related digital and mobile media as well as MNI, which generates revenue through the sale of geographic and demographic-targeted digital and print advertising programs sold to third parties. The local media segment contributed 27 percent of Meredith's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2020.\nFiscal 2020 local media revenues declined 11 percent and operating profit decreased 48 percent primarily due to lower political advertising due to the cyclical nature of such revenues, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenues, and a non-cash impairment charge.\nLocal media revenues rose 25 percent and operating profit grew 49 percent in fiscal 2019 primarily reflecting increased cyclical political advertising and higher retransmission consent revenues.\nLocal media operating results for the last three fiscal years were as follows:\n\nRevenues\nThe table below presents the components of local media revenues for the last three fiscal years.\n\nAdvertising Related Revenue\nFiscal 2020 local media revenues decreased 11 percent as compared to the prior year. Advertising related revenue declined 24 percent. Political spot advertising revenues totaled $23.9 million in the current year compared with $102.9 million in the prior year. Fluctuations in political spot advertising revenues at our stations and throughout the broadcasting industry generally follow the biennial cycle of election campaigns.\nNon-political spot advertising revenues declined 12 percent. Local non-political spot advertising revenues decreased 13 percent and national non-political spot advertising revenues declined 9 percent in fiscal 2020. The Company estimates that cancellations and delays in non-political spot revenues due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $37.2 million adverse impact on non-political spot revenues during fiscal 2020, with $30.7 million of this impact occurring in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nDigital advertising revenues increased 12 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to increased programmatic ad and video sales. The Company estimates that cancellations and delays in digital advertising revenues due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $0.8 million adverse impact on digital advertising revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nThird party sales, which represent revenue generated through selling advertising space on third-party platforms, declined 16 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to decreased coverwrap and print insert sales. The Company estimates that cancellations and delays in third party sales due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $7.4 million adverse impact on third party sales revenue during fiscal 2020, with $6.4 million of this impact occurring in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nLocal media revenues increased 25 percent in fiscal 2019. Advertising related revenues increased 29 percent. Political advertising revenues increased primarily due to the November 2018 elections. Political spot advertising revenues totaled $102.9 million in fiscal 2019 compared with $16.1 million in fiscal 2018. Political spot advertising displaces a certain amount of non-political spot advertising; therefore, the revenues are not entirely incremental.\nNon-political spot advertising revenues decreased 3 percent in fiscal 2019 due primarily to political spot advertising displacement. Local non-political advertising revenues declined 5 percent and national non-political advertising revenues decreased 3 percent in fiscal 2019. Digital advertising revenues increased slightly as compared to the prior year. Third party sales increased primarily due to the addition of revenues from Time.\nWhile the Company is not able to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenues into fiscal 2021, the Company saw month-by-month improvement in advertising related revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and, if the economy continues to recover, the Company expects this trend to continue into fiscal 2021. Future actions such as renewed shelter-in-place or business closing orders could negatively impact these expectations.\nConsumer Related Revenue\nConsumer related revenue represents retransmission consent fees from cable, satellite, and telecommunications operators. Consumer related revenue increased in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 primarily due to annual escalators and renegotiated contracts.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue increased 48 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to increased revenues from programming streams on digital channels. Fiscal 2019 other revenue increased 65 percent primarily due to an increase in closed captioning revenues.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nFiscal 2020 operating costs and expenses increased 2 percent primarily due to higher programming fees paid to affiliated networks of $27.2 million partially offset by reductions in third party acquisition costs of $6.2 million and performance-based compensation expenses of $3.8 million.\nThe Company estimates the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a reduction in local media operating costs and expenses of $12.5 million in fiscal 2020. Of the reductions in third party acquisition costs and performance-based compensation expenses noted above, the Company estimates that $5.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, were related to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company also estimates that employee-related compensation expenses declined $3.9 million and other costs and expenses were lower by $1.5 million due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhile the Company is not able to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operating costs and expenses into fiscal 2021, the Company expects that, to the extent advertising related revenues recover, related direct costs and expenses will also increase.\nFiscal 2019 operating costs and expenses increased 16 percent primarily due to the addition of operating expenses from Time of $44.6 million and the addition of higher programming fees paid to affiliated networks of $30.5 million.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $22.3 million to reduce the value of one of the local media segment's FCC licenses.\nOperating Profit\nFiscal 2020 operating profit declined 48 percent primarily due to lower political advertising revenues of $79.0 million, an estimated reduction in operating profit of $32.9 million due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the non-cash impairment charge of $22.3 million.\nLocal media operating profit increased 49 percent in fiscal 2019 primarily due to the increase in high-margin political spot advertising revenues.\nUNALLOCATED CORPORATE EXPENSES\nUnallocated corporate expenses are general corporate overhead expenses not attributable to the operating groups. These expenses for the last three fiscal years were as follows:\n\nUnallocated corporate expenses decreased 38 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to decreases in integration and exit costs of $22.7 million, performance-based compensation expenses of $17.2 million, employee-related compensation costs of $6.1 million, and consulting services expenses of $4.3 million partially offset by increases in other miscellaneous business expenses.\nUnallocated corporate expenses decreased $67.5 million in fiscal 2019 primarily due to decreases in severance and related benefit expenses of $47.1 million, a reduction in transaction and integration-related costs of $17.2 million, and absence of accelerated share-based compensation expenses of $9.2 million related to Time awards that vested upon acquisition in fiscal 2018 and of $3.5 million in accelerated share-based compensation expense related to involuntary terminations. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $9.2 million in consulting services expense.\nOf the $17.2 million reduction in performance-based compensation expenses in fiscal 2020, the Company estimates that $4.4 million of that reduction was due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenues and operating results of the Company. Other than the reduction in performance-based compensation expenses and a reduction of $1.1 million in other expenses, the Company estimates that the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a significant impact on unallocated corporate operating costs and expenses during fiscal 2020. In addition, the Company does not anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a significant impact on unallocated corporate operating costs and expenses in fiscal 2021.\nCONSOLIDATED\nConsolidated Operating Expenses\nConsolidated operating expenses for the last three fiscal years were as follows:\n\nProduction, Distribution, and Editorial Costs\nProduction, distribution, and editorial costs decreased 10 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower combined production, distribution, and paper costs of $86.4 million and a decline in non-payroll related editorial costs of $48.0 million partially offset by an increase in programming fees paid to affiliated networks of $27.2 million.\nFiscal 2019 production, distribution, and editorial costs increased 34 percent as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the addition of production, distribution, and editorial costs of Time of $290.5 million and increases in programming fees paid to affiliated networks of $30.5 million. These increases were partially offset by declines in production, distribution, and editorial expenses of MXM of $26.9 million.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses declined 7 percent primarily due to a reduction in employee compensation costs of $49.0 million, decreases in performance-based compensation expenses of $26.5 million, and a reduction in third party acquisition costs of $17.5 million.\nFiscal 2019 selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 37 percent primarily due to an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses of Time in our national and local media segments of $406.0 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses of MXM of $60.0 million.\nAcquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities\nAcquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities expense declined by 73 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to reductions in severance and related benefit costs of $36.7 million and declines in integration and exit costs of $41.0 million.\nFiscal 2019 acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities expense primarily included $51.5 million of severance and related benefit costs and $64.6 million of integration costs primarily for business advisors and software and systems implementations and modifications, and a credit for a gain on the sale of the Company's 30 percent interest in Charleston Tennis of $6.4 million.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased 11 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to reductions in depreciation expense of $18.6 million and in amortization expense of $11.4 million in our national media segment.\nThe increase in fiscal 2019 depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the addition of Time's depreciation and amortization expense.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Long-lived Assets\nThe Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $252.7 million in fiscal 2020 to reduce the carrying value of the national media segment's goodwill. In addition, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $87.9 million in the national media segment related to vacant leased space at its location in New York City. The Company also recorded non-cash impairment charges of $26.4 million to reduce the value of several of the national media segment's trademarks and $22.3 million to reduce the value of one of the local media segment's FCC licenses. The magnitude of the impairments of goodwill and other long-lived assets were unfavorably impacted by the volatility of the financial markets and the uncertainty surrounding the long-term economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe impairment of long-lived assets recorded in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 related primarily to non-cash impairments of trademarks in the national media segment.\nOperating Expenses\nEmployee compensation, including benefits, was the largest component of our operating expenses in fiscal 2020. Employee compensation represented 23 percent of total operating expenses in fiscal 2020, compared to 26 percent\nin fiscal 2019, and 38 percent in fiscal 2018. National media paper, production, and postage combined expense was the second largest component of our operating costs in fiscal 2020, representing 13 percent of the total. These expenses were 15 percent of total operating expenses in fiscal 2019 and 14 percent of total operating expenses in fiscal 2018.\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\nFiscal 2020 loss from operations of $94.1 million was a decrease of $381.1 million from fiscal 2019 income from operations of $287.0 million. The decrease is primarily due to non-cash impairment charges of $389.3 million. Absent impairment charges in both years, fiscal 2020 income from operations would have been $295.2 million, a decrease of 10 percent compared to $328.8 million in fiscal 2019, primarily due to an estimated impact from the COVID-19 pandemic of $83.1 million and a reduction in political revenues of $79.0 million more than offsetting a reduction in acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities of $74.1 million, a decrease in depreciation and amortization of $27.7 million, and a decline in performance-based compensation expenses of $17.3 million.\nFiscal 2019 income from operations of $287.0 million increased $200.1 million primarily due to the increase in operating profit of our local media segment of $91.7 million resulting from the cyclical nature of political advertising, the addition of operating income from Time of $79.7 million, and a reduction in acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities of $69.2 million.\nNon-operating Income (Expense), net\nFiscal 2020 net non-operating expense was $1.3 million as compared to fiscal 2019 net non-operating income of $24.2 million. The change was primarily due to an increase in pension settlement charges of $16.4 million and the reduction in the pension and other postretirement plans benefit credits $10.7 million.\nNet non-operating income was $24.2 million in fiscal 2019, an increase of $23.5 million from $0.7 million in fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the pension and other postretirement plans benefit credit and a gain on the sale of the Company's 30 percent interest in Charleston Tennis, which was sold in September 2018.\nInterest Expense, net\nNet interest expense was $145.8 million in fiscal 2020, $170.6 million in fiscal 2019, and $97.2 million in fiscal 2018. Average long-term debt outstanding was $2.4 billion in fiscal 2020, $2.7 billion in fiscal 2019, and $1.9 billion in fiscal 2018. The Company's approximate weighted average interest rate was 6.1 percent in fiscal 2020, 7.1 percent in fiscal 2019, and 5.1 percent in fiscal 2018. The weighted average interest rates include the effects of extinguishment losses during fiscal 2019 and 2018, and derivative financial instruments until their termination in January 2018.\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $10.9 million of extinguishment losses related to the early payment of debt and repricing of its senior secured term loan (Term Loan B). During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Company's acquisition of Time, the Company repaid and terminated Meredith's existing indebtedness. In connection with the payoff of this indebtedness, Meredith recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.2 million. In conjunction with the repayment of its debt, the Company also settled the associated interest rate swap agreements and recognized a gain on the settlement of $1.6 million. In addition, the Company incurred $17.5 million in fees that were recorded in interest expense related to an undrawn bridge loan commitment fee.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 13.3 percent in fiscal 2020, 8.2 percent in fiscal 2019, and 1,282.4 percent in fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2020, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $32.2 million for an effective rate of 13.3 percent. The fiscal 2020 effective tax rate was impacted primarily by the national media goodwill impairment charge. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $252.7 million\nto reduce the carrying value of goodwill. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $26.9 million related to this goodwill impairment charge.\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company recorded income tax expense of $11.5 million for an effective rate of 8.2 percent. The fiscal 2019 effective tax rate was primarily impacted by a credit to income taxes of $23.5 million related to write-off of worthless stock and related bad debt. For fiscal 2018, Meredith recorded a tax benefit of $123.6 million primarily reflecting the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities and a reduced tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. This tax benefit was offset in part by non-deductible expenses including transaction costs.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Act, which significantly changed previous U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and other changes such as bonus depreciation that allows for full expensing of qualified property and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and certain executive compensation. For fiscal 2018, the change in the corporate tax rate resulted in a blended U.S. federal statutory rate for the Company of 28.1 percent.\nIn connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we recorded a provisional net tax benefit of $133.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2018.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Today, Meredith uses multiple distribution platforms- including print, digital, mobile, video, and broadcast television-to provide consumers with content they desire and to deliver the messages of its advertising and marketing partners.\nMeredith operates two business segments. The national media segment serves more than 190 million unduplicated American consumers, including 120 million women and 90 percent of U.S. millennial women. Meredith is a leader\nin creating content across media platforms and life stages in key consumer interest areas such as entertainment, food, lifestyle, parenting, and home. Meredith's leading national brands include People, Better Homes & Gardens, InStyle, Allrecipes, Real Simple, Shape, Southern Living, and Martha Stewart Living. The national media segment also features robust brand licensing activities, including more than 3,000 SKUs of branded products at 4,000 Walmart stores across the U.S. and at Walmart.com. The national media segment also includes leading affinity marketer Synapse, and The Foundry 360, the Company's state-of-the-art creative lab and content studio.\nMeredith's local media segment includes 17 television stations in 12 markets reaching 11 percent of U.S. households and nearly 30 million viewers. Meredith's portfolio is concentrated in large, fast-growing markets, with seven stations in the nation's Top 25 markets-including Atlanta, Phoenix, St. Louis, and Portland-and 13 in the Top 50. Meredith's stations produce 745 hours of local news and entertainment content each week and operate leading local digital destinations. The local media segment also includes MNI, which delivers targeted advertising solutions to more than 1,200 clients on a local, regional, and national level.\nBoth segments operate primarily in the U.S. and compete against similar media and other types of media on both a local and national basis. In fiscal 2020, the national media segment accounted for 73 percent of the Company's $2.8 billion in revenues while local media segment revenues contributed 27 percent.\nThe Company accomplished a number of initiatives during fiscal 2020, including increasing brand engagement with consumers and advertisers and improving our competitive position. Highlights include:\nFirst, in fiscal 2020 we added to our digital businesses and capabilities. For example:\n \u2022 We built a new technology platform with robust data capabilities supporting our expanding digital activities. This new proprietary platform, which unifies legacy platforms onto the same technology stack, includes not only our content management system, but also our proprietary taxonomy, our first-party data, and our user identity graph. This prepares us well for a world where third party cookies are no longer supported. \nIt also allows us to bring together consumer profiles, real-time insights, and intent signals to predict trends that inform our editorial and product roadmap, provide more personalized experiences to our consumers, and give advertisers the ability to tailor the right messages and products to the users most likely to buy at any given time.\n \u2022 We advanced our video and audio strategies. Video views grew more than 50 percent in fiscal 2020 across our owned and operated properties. Responding to consumer demand, we published a third more videos during fiscal 2020. We also launched a series of new podcasts under the Allrecipes, Southern Living, and Parents brands as a way to tell stories in an increasingly popular way. We have more planned, including a new People podcast. \n \u2022 We added to our subscription acquisition and e-commerce capabilities, which are important avenues for growth. Meredith first entered the e-commerce space with the acquisition of ShopNation seven years ago. Since then, revenue growth from our e-commerce activities, including digital couponing, content, and affiliate commerce, has been exceptionally strong - up 28 percent in fiscal 2020. \nSecond, we launched a series of new brands, product expansions, and re-alignments to improve profitability in fiscal 2020. In our national media operations, we:\n \u2022 Launched Reveal, a new lifestyle magazine partnering with Property Brothers television show hosts Drew and Jonathan Scott; Sweet July, with best-selling author, restaurateur, and television host Ayesha Curry; and a new multimedia personal finance brand Millie that is dedicated to helping women achieve their financial goals. \n \u2022 Re-aligned several brands in our national media portfolio to improve efficiency. This included closing Family Circle magazine and transitioning Rachael Ray Every Day to a premium newsstand title published on a quarterly basis. This strategy has proven successful with other of our brands, including Coastal Living, Cooking Light, and Traditional Home. The latter three brands are now also offering subscriptions at a higher price point than under the previous advertising-driven model. \n \u2022 Completed the last of our planned asset sales. This included the Money brand, FanSided, and Meredith's interests in Viant and Xumo. \nIn our local media operations, we:\n \u2022 Launched two national television shows based on the People and Southern Living brands. People Now was a weekend program during fiscal 2020 and is expected to become a daily primetime show across our network in early fiscal 2021. Similarly, Southern Living has been expanded to weekly syndication. Leveraging our leading brands across additional platforms is an exciting opportunity and something we hope to scale over time. \n \u2022 Continued to expand news production and are now producing 745 hours of local content each week. We have seen significant growth in ratings as a result of consumer interest in local news during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nWe pursued a number of initiatives in fiscal 2020 to grow engagement and revenues from the more than 190 million U.S. consumers who regularly interact with our brands. In these challenging times, consumers are looking to Meredith's trusted brands for important news and information, practical advice, home improvement ideas, recipes, inspiration, and moments of escape.\nIn our national media operations:\n \u2022 Visits to our digital brands grew by 14 percent in our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter compared to the prior-year period, driven by strong growth in brands focused on food, health, and home lifestyle categories that give Meredith access to an extremely wide audience. These include Allrecipes, Shape, and Martha Stewart. \n \u2022 Our licensing and digital and other consumer driven revenues grew 8 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and 12 percent in fiscal 2020. This growth was driven primarily by Apple News + royalties, e-commerce, and our performance marketing activities. It also included stronger sales of our branded products at retail - particularly our Better Homes & Gardens line at Walmart. \n \u2022 Our magazine business is the largest in the United States, reaching more than 120 million women. This is nearly 95 percent of women and is one of our most powerful points of differentiation. People is the industry's largest brand, reaching nearly 90 million unduplicated consumers. Allrecipes, which has seen strong consumer growth with an acceleration due to COVID-19, is now the industry's No. 2 brand. Better Homes & Gardens is also in the top 10. On average, we sell approximately 70 magazines brands at newsstand and more than 30 subscriptions every minute. \n \u2022 We continued to see strong growth in various subscription channels that drive high lifetime subscriber value in our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. These include our owned and operated digital properties, paid search, direct mail, and renewal campaigns. For example: \n \u25e6 Demand via our digital and partner networks is strong. Since mid-March, we have seen consistent year-over-year growth with conversion rates 50 percent higher than normal. \n \u25e6 Traditional magazine subscription acquisition and renewal efforts for all of our major titles are up strongly as well. For example, two direct mail campaigns for the People brand are performing more than 50 percent above targets, and a campaign for Southern Living is performing at twice our expectations. In addition, renewals are pacing well above historical trends. \n \u25e6 Our newsstand business, Meredith Premium Publishing, produces 300 special interest issues annually at prices ranging from $10 to $15. Our strong consumer data capability and high-quality brands are competitive advantages, giving us the ability to adapt quickly to changing trends and produce content consumers want under brands that have strong consumer recognition. During Fiscal 2020, we added almost 20 percent more magazine pockets at newsstand, bringing our total to 1.9 million. \nIn our local media operations:\n \u2022 Our television stations' focus on their individual markets drove strong ratings performance throughout the fiscal year. For example, during the July 2020 rating period, our stations in 7 of our 12 markets ranked No. 1 or No. 2 from sign-on to sign-off. It also drove digital results, as the number of visits to our local media sites grew 18 percent in fiscal 2020. \n \u2022 We grew retransmission revenues by 10 percent in fiscal 2020 as we renewed nearly 60 percent of our retransmission consent relationships and all our CBS affiliations. \nNATIONAL MEDIA\nAdvertising related revenues made up 48 percent of fiscal 2020 national media revenues. These revenues were generated from the sale of advertising space in our magazines and on our digital properties to clients interested in promoting their brands, products, and services to consumers as well as revenue we generate selling advertising space on third-party platforms. Changes in advertising related revenues tend to correlate with changes in the level of economic activity in the U.S. Indicators of economic activity include changes in the level of gross domestic product, consumer spending, housing starts, unemployment rates, auto sales, and interest rates. Circulation levels of Meredith's magazines, reader demographic data, and the advertising rates charged relative to other comparable available advertising opportunities also affect the level of advertising related revenues.\nConsumer related revenues accounted for 48 percent of fiscal 2020 national media revenues. Consumer related revenue includes all revenues either driven by or otherwise linked to consumer buying decisions and include circulation activities; magazine subscriptions sales for third-party publishers; brand licensing; digital lead generation; and other e-commerce sales, product sales, and related activities. Circulation revenues result from the sale of magazines to consumers through subscriptions and by single copy sales on newsstands in print form, primarily at major retailers and grocery/drug stores, and in digital form on tablets and other media devices. In the short term, subscription revenues, which accounted for 61 percent of consumer related revenues, are less susceptible to economic changes because subscriptions are generally sold for terms of one to three years. The same economic factors that affect advertising related revenues also can influence consumers' response to subscription offers and result in lower revenues and/or higher costs to maintain subscriber levels over time. Subscription revenues per copy and related costs can also vary significantly by subscription source. Some subscription sources generate lower revenues than other sources but have proportionately lower related costs. A key factor in our subscription success is our industry-leading database. It contains an abundance of attributes on 180 million individuals, including 90 percent of U.S. millennial women. The size and depth of our database is a key to our circulation model and allows more precise consumer targeting. Newsstand revenues are more volatile than subscription revenues and can vary significantly month-to-month depending on economic and other factors. The remaining consumer related revenues are generally affected by changes in the level of economic activity in the U.S., including changes in the level of gross domestic product, consumer spending, unemployment rates, and interest rates.\nThe remaining 4 percent of national media revenues came from a variety of activities that included the sale of customer relationship marketing products and services. In addition, for certain sold brands, Meredith has provided consumer marketing, subscription fulfillment, paper purchasing, printing, and other services under outsourcing agreements and records such revenue in other revenue.\nNational media's major expense categories are employee compensation costs and production and delivery of publications and promotional mailings. Employee compensation, which includes benefits expense, represented 18 percent of national media's operating expenses in fiscal 2020. Compensation expense is affected by salary and incentive levels, the number of employees, the costs of our various employee benefit plans, and other factors.\nPaper, postage, and production charges represented 17 percent of the segment's operating expenses in fiscal 2020. The price of paper can vary significantly on the basis of worldwide demand and supply for paper in general and for specific types of paper used by Meredith. The printing of our publications is outsourced. We have a multi-year contract for the printing of our magazines, a practice which reduces price fluctuations over the contract term. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the USPS and legislative mandates imposed on the USPS. The USPS adjusted rates most recently in January 2020, which resulted in an increase of approximately 1.9 percent. While we expect postage rates to increase again in January 2021, an ongoing legislatively mandated review of the existing law by the Postal Regulatory Commission could potentially result in adjustments to the current rate-setting regime. Meredith continues to work independently and with others to encourage and help the USPS find and implement efficiencies to contain rate increases.\nImpairment charges accounted for 16 percent of national media's fiscal 2020 expenses. The remaining 49 percent of fiscal 2020 national media expenses included depreciation and amortization, costs for magazine newsstand distribution, advertising and promotional efforts, and overhead costs for facilities and technology services.\nLOCAL MEDIA\nLocal media derives the majority of its revenues-53 percent in fiscal 2020-from the sale of spot advertising on our stations' digital and mobile media properties as well as revenue we generate selling advertising space on third-party platforms. The remainder comes from television retransmission consent fees, television production, and other services.\nThe stations sell advertising to both local/regional and national accounts. Political advertising revenues are cyclical in that they are significantly greater during biennial election campaigns (which take place primarily in odd-numbered fiscal years) than at other times. We generate additional revenues from digital activities and programs focused on local interests such as community events and college and professional sports.\nChanges in advertising related revenues tend to correlate with changes in the level of economic activity in the U.S. and in the local markets in which we operate stations, and with the cyclical changes in political advertising discussed previously. Programming content, audience share, audience demographics, and the advertising rates charged relative to other available advertising opportunities also affect advertising revenues. On occasion, unusual events necessitate uninterrupted television coverage and will adversely affect spot advertising revenues.\nLocal media's major expense categories are programming fees paid to the networks and employee compensation. Programming fees paid to the networks represented 34 percent of this segment's fiscal 2020 expenses. Employee compensation represented 29 percent of local media's operating expenses in fiscal 2020 and is affected by the same factors noted for national media. Sales and promotional activities, costs to produce local news programming, and general overhead costs for facilities and technical resources accounted for most of the remaining 37 percent of local media's fiscal 2020 operating expenses.\nFISCAL 2020 FINANCIAL OVERVIEW\n \u2022 The Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $252.7 million to reduce the carrying value of the national media segment's goodwill. In addition, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $26.4 million to reduce the value of several of the national media segment's trademarks and $22.3 million to reduce the value of one of the local media segment's FCC licenses. \n \u2022 The Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $87.9 million in the national media segment related to vacant leased space at its location in New York City. \n \u2022 The Company estimates that cancellations or delays in advertising campaigns, declines in newsstand sales, and the cancellation of events due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $153.7 million adverse impact on revenues in fiscal 2020. Correspondingly, the Company estimates that operating expenses declined $70.6 million due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \u2022 National media revenues decreased 11 percent primarily due to declines in print advertising and subscription revenues as a result of portfolio changes and a reduction in advertising related and consumer related revenues due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic partially offset by increases in digital and other consumer driven and other revenues. Operating expenses increased primarily due to the goodwill, vacated lease space, and trademark impairment charges noted above. Due primarily to the impairment charges, the national media segment ended fiscal 2020 with an operating loss of $167.7 million. \n \u2022 Local media revenues decreased 11 percent primarily due to declines in high margin political advertising revenues due to the cyclical nature of political advertising and a reduction in non-political and third party advertising related revenues due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating profit declined 48 percent primarily due to lower political advertising revenues and other advertising related revenues and the non-cash impairment charge noted above. \n \u2022 Unallocated corporate expenses decreased $44.9 million primarily due to reductions in integration and exit costs and performance-based compensation expenses. \n \u2022 The Company raised $710 million of new secured debt, and used the proceeds, along with existing cash on hand, to redeem all outstanding Series A preferred stock. \n \u2022 The Company reported a net loss from continuing operations for fiscal 2020 of $209.0 million reflecting the non-cash impairment charges of $389.3 million ($327.6 million after-tax). Absent impairment charges in both years, the Company would have had net earnings from continuing operations of $118.6 million compared to $160.3 million in fiscal 2019, a decline of 26 percent. \n \u2022 In fiscal 2020, we generated $306.6 million in operating cash flows, invested $55.4 million in capital improvements, and invested $23.1 million in acquisitions of and investments in businesses. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended June 30,\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,848.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,188.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,264.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses\n</td> <td>(2,526.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,758.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,984.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities\n</td> <td>(26.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(170.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets\n</td> <td>(389.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>(2,942.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,901.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,177.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(94.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>287.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings (loss) from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(209.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings (loss)\n</td> <td>(234.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings (loss) per common share from continuing operations\n</td> <td>(9.85\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings (loss) per common share\n</td> <td>(10.41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.70\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.47\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>n/m - Not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOVERVIEW\nFollowing are brief descriptions of recent material acquisitions and a discussion of the trends and uncertainties that affected our businesses. Following the Overview is an analysis of the results of operations for the national media and local media segments and an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the last three fiscal years.\nAcquisitions\nOn January 31, 2018, Meredith completed its acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Time. As a result, Time became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Meredith. Since February 1, 2018, the first day of operations for the combined company, the operating results of Time have been included in the Company's consolidated operating results. While the majority of Time's operations are reported in Meredith's national media segment, one business unit of Time is reported in Meredith's local media segment and certain expenses are reported in unallocated corporate. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nAs the Company integrated Time, the ability to separately track Time-related revenues and expenses, especially unallocated corporate expenses, became less feasible. Therefore, throughout MD&A reasonable estimates of incremental Time revenues and expenses for fiscal 2019 have been disclosed where possible.\nTrends and Uncertainties\nAdvertising revenues accounted for 49 percent of total revenues in fiscal 2020. Advertising demand is the Company's key uncertainty, and its fluctuation from period to period can have a material effect on operating results. Demand for political advertising in the Company's local media segment is cyclical in nature, generally following the biennial cycle of election campaigns with peaks occurring in our odd fiscal years (e.g., fiscal 2019, fiscal 2021) and particularly in our second quarter of those fiscal years. Other significant uncertainties that can affect operating results include fluctuations in the cost of paper, postage rates, and over time, television programming rights. The Company's cash flows from operating activities, our primary source of liquidity, is adversely affected when the advertising market is weak or when costs rise. One of our priorities is to manage our businesses prudently during expanding and contracting economic cycles to maximize shareholder return over time. To manage the uncertainties inherent in our businesses, we prepare monthly internal forecasts of anticipated results of operations and monitor\nthe economic indicators mentioned in the Executive Overview. See Item 1A - Risk Factors in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nNATIONAL MEDIA\nThe following discussion reviews operating results for our national media segment, which includes magazine publishing, digital and customer relationship marketing, digital and mobile media, affinity marketing, brand licensing, database-related activities, and other related operations. The national media segment contributed 73 percent of Meredith's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2020.\nFiscal 2020 national media revenues declined 11 percent. Costs and expenses decreased 11 percent, and impairment charges of $367.0 million were recorded in the national media segment. Due to the impairment charges, the national media operations reported an operating loss of $167.7 million in fiscal 2020.\nNational media revenues increased 48 percent in fiscal 2019. Operating costs and expenses increased 48 percent. Acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities of $54.3 million and impairment charges of $41.8 million were recorded in the national media segment. Operating profit increased 48 percent primarily due to having a full year of results of the acquired Time business in fiscal 2019.\nNational media operating results for the last three fiscal years were as follows:\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Advertising related revenue decreased 14 percent in fiscal 2020.\nMeredith has made changes to its portfolio of brands and titles intended to enhance the consumer experience, provide more effective and efficient platforms for advertisers, and increase the profitability of the portfolio. These changes included closing the Money, Martha Stewart Weddings, and Family Circle magazines, changing the frequency of Entertainment Weekly to a monthly title, transitioning Coastal Living, Traditional Home, and Rachael Ray Every Day to premium newsstand titles, and merging Cooking Light into Meredith's popular EatingWell title, which resulted in declines in combined print advertising revenues of approximately $60.0 million in fiscal 2020. Of\nthe remaining decline in print advertising revenues of $76.6 million, the Company estimates that advertising cancellations and delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $45.2 million adverse impact in fiscal 2020, with $41.3 million of the decline coming in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. The remaining decrease in print advertising revenues is primarily due to changing market demands for print advertising.\nDigital advertising decreased 5 percent in fiscal 2020. While the Company saw increased digital advertising revenues during the first eight months of fiscal 2020, the Company estimates that cancellations and delays in digital advertising revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $33.0 million adverse impact in fiscal 2020 with $27.0 million of this impact occurring in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nThe 3 percent decrease in third party sales was primarily due to reductions in cover wrap sales as well as decreases in advertising pages in publications the Company produces on behalf of others. The Company estimates that cancellations and delays in digital third party sales due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $3.5 million adverse impact during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nWhile the Company is not able to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenues into fiscal 2021, the Company is seeing improvement in advertising related revenues into the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and, if the economy continues to recover, the Company expects this trend to continue into fiscal 2021. Future actions such as renewed shelter-in-place or business closing orders could negatively impact these expectations.\nNational media advertising related revenue increased 48 percent in fiscal 2019. The increase in print advertising was primarily due to the addition of print advertising revenues of Time partially offset by a 10 percent decline in comparative print advertising revenues. Approximately 30 percent of the decline in comparative print advertising revenue was due to changes to the marketing of Fit Pregnancy and Baby and Family Fun magazines. While the women's service category of titles saw a slight increase in print advertising revenues, the lifestyle and parenthood categories saw declines. Digital advertising increased primarily due to the addition of digital advertising revenues of Time. Comparative digital advertising revenues increased 14 percent in fiscal 2019. The increase in third party sales was primarily due to the addition of Time.\nConsumer Related Revenue\nConsumer related revenue includes all revenues either driven by or otherwise linked to consumer buying decisions. Fiscal 2020 consumer related revenues declined 9 percent as compared to the prior year.\nApproximately 65 percent of the decline in subscription revenue was due to the portfolio changes detailed above. In addition, a trade book line of business was closed, which resulted in a $5.4 million decrease in subscription revenue in fiscal 2020. The remaining decrease in subscription revenue in fiscal 2020 was due primarily to a change in mix to subscriptions received directly by the Company. Subscriptions received directly by the Company tend to have lower subscription revenues, lower acquisition costs, and higher renewal rates. Digital and other consumer driven revenue increased primarily due to increases in ecommerce revenues from direct product sales and lead generation referrals. The Company estimates that shelter-in-place orders and reductions in travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $17.6 million adverse impact on newsstand revenues in the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2020.\nConsumer related revenue increased 69 percent in fiscal 2019. The increases in subscription and newsstand revenues were primarily due to the addition of subscription revenues of Time partially offset by approximately 10 percent declines in comparative subscription and newsstand revenues. Digital and other consumer driven revenue increased primarily due to the growth in e-commerce revenues. The increases in the remaining categories of consumer related revenue were primarily due to the addition of Time revenues.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue increased 15 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the delivery of episodes of a streaming program created for a third party. The Company estimates that the cancellation of events sponsored by the Company due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $9.0 million adverse impact on other revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nFiscal 2019 other revenue decreased 48 percent primarily due to declines of $83.6 million in Meredith Xcelerated Marketing (MXM) revenues due to the sale of MXM in fiscal 2018.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nNational media operating costs and expenses decreased 11 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower combined production, distribution, and paper costs of $86.4 million, a reduction in employee-related compensation costs of $54.1 million, a decline in non-payroll editorial costs of $48.0 million, and a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $30.0 million.\nThe Company estimates the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a reduction in national media operating costs and expenses of $52.8 million in fiscal 2020, relating to reductions in production, distribution, editorial, employee-related compensation, performance-based compensation expenses, and selling expenses.\nWhile the Company is not able to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operating costs and expenses into fiscal 2021, the Company expects that to the extent advertising related revenues recover, related direct costs and expenses will also increase.\nFiscal 2019 national media costs and expenses increased 48 percent primarily due to the addition of Time operating costs and expenses of $767.4 million and an increase in employee compensation and related costs of $24.0 million partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of MXM of $86.9 million and a reduction in circulation expenses of $18.2 million.\nAcquisition, Disposition, and Restructuring Related Activities\nNational media acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities decreased $51.9 million in fiscal 2020 primarily due to declines in severance and related benefit expenses of $36.7 million and a reduction in integration costs of $18.3 million.\nFiscal 2019 national media acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities increased 26 percent primarily due to an increase in integration costs of $21.8 million partially offset by a decrease in severance and related benefit expenses of $12.3 million.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the national media segment recorded a non-cash impairment of goodwill of $252.7 million, non-cash impairments of an operating lease asset and associated leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures totaling $87.9 million, and non-cash impairments of trademarks of $21.2 million. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the national media segment recorded a $5.2 million non-cash impairment of a trademark. The magnitude of the impairments of goodwill and other long-lived assets recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was unfavorably impacted by the recent volatility of the financial markets and the uncertainty surrounding the long-term economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe national media segment recorded non-cash impairment charges of $41.8 million in fiscal 2019 related to trademarks.\nOperating Profit (Loss)\nNational media operations resulted in a $167.7 million loss in fiscal 2020 reflecting the $367.0 million non-cash impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets. Absent the impairment charges in both years, national media operating profit would have been $199.3 million, an increase of 19 percent when compared to $167.8 million in fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to previously executed restructuring activities and ongoing cost-savings initiatives reducing operating expenses partially offset by a reduction in revenues as discussed above.\nFiscal 2019 national media operating profit grew to $126.0 million primarily due to operating income from Time of $79.1 million and an increase in the profit contribution of our digital consumer products operations of $7.6 million partially offset by a $33.9 million decrease in the profit contribution of our magazine operations and an increase in the impairment of trademarks of $19.1 million.\nLOCAL MEDIA\nThe following discussion reviews operating results for the Company's local media segment, which consists of 17 television stations and related digital and mobile media as well as MNI, which generates revenue through the sale of geographic and demographic-targeted digital and print advertising programs sold to third parties. The local media segment contributed 27 percent of Meredith's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2020.\nFiscal 2020 local media revenues declined 11 percent and operating profit decreased 48 percent primarily due to lower political advertising due to the cyclical nature of such revenues, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenues, and a non-cash impairment charge.\nLocal media revenues rose 25 percent and operating profit grew 49 percent in fiscal 2019 primarily reflecting increased cyclical political advertising and higher retransmission consent revenues.\nLocal media operating results for the last three fiscal years were as follows:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended June 30,\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>769.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>863.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>693.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses\n</td> <td>(598.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(584.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(505.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of long-lived assets\n</td> <td>(22.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>(623.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(585.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(506.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>278.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>n/m -

Advertising related revenue declined 24 percent. Political spot advertising revenues totaled $23.9 million in the current year compared with $102.9 million in the prior year. Fluctuations in political spot advertising revenues at our stations and throughout the broadcasting industry generally follow the biennial cycle of election campaigns.\nNon-political spot advertising revenues declined 12 percent. Local non-political spot advertising revenues decreased 13 percent and national non-political spot advertising revenues declined 9 percent in fiscal 2020. The Company estimates that cancellations and delays in non-political spot revenues due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $37.2 million adverse impact on non-political spot revenues during fiscal 2020, with $30.7 million of this impact occurring in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nDigital advertising revenues increased 12 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to increased programmatic ad and video sales. The Company estimates that cancellations and delays in digital advertising revenues due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $0.8 million adverse impact on digital advertising revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nThird party sales, which represent revenue generated through selling advertising space on third-party platforms, declined 16 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to decreased coverwrap and print insert sales. The Company estimates that cancellations and delays in third party sales due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a $7.4 million adverse impact on third party sales revenue during fiscal 2020, with $6.4 million of this impact occurring in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nLocal media revenues increased 25 percent in fiscal 2019. Advertising related revenues increased 29 percent. Political advertising revenues increased primarily due to the November 2018 elections. Political spot advertising revenues totaled $102.9 million in fiscal 2019 compared with $16.1 million in fiscal 2018. Political spot advertising displaces a certain amount of non-political spot advertising; therefore, the revenues are not entirely incremental.\nNon-political spot advertising revenues decreased 3 percent in fiscal 2019 due primarily to political spot advertising displacement. Local non-political advertising revenues declined 5 percent and national non-political advertising revenues decreased 3 percent in fiscal 2019. Digital advertising revenues increased slightly as compared to the prior year. Third party sales increased primarily due to the addition of revenues from Time.\nWhile the Company is not able to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenues into fiscal 2021, the Company saw month-by-month improvement in advertising related revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and, if the economy continues to recover, the Company expects this trend to continue into fiscal 2021. Future actions such as renewed shelter-in-place or business closing orders could negatively impact these expectations.\nConsumer Related Revenue\nConsumer related revenue represents retransmission consent fees from cable, satellite, and telecommunications operators. Consumer related revenue increased in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 primarily due to annual escalators and renegotiated contracts.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue increased 48 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to increased revenues from programming streams on digital channels. Fiscal 2019 other revenue increased 65 percent primarily due to an increase in closed captioning revenues.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nFiscal 2020 operating costs and expenses increased 2 percent primarily due to higher programming fees paid to affiliated networks of $27.2 million partially offset by reductions in third party acquisition costs of $6.2 million and performance-based compensation expenses of $3.8 million.\nThe Company estimates the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a reduction in local media operating costs and expenses of $12.5 million in fiscal 2020. Of the reductions in third party acquisition costs and performance-based compensation expenses noted above, the Company estimates that $5.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, were related to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company also estimates that employee-related compensation expenses declined $3.9 million and other costs and expenses were lower by $1.5 million due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhile the Company is not able to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operating costs and expenses into fiscal 2021, the Company expects that, to the extent advertising related revenues recover, related direct costs and expenses will also increase.\nFiscal 2019 operating costs and expenses increased 16 percent primarily due to the addition of operating expenses from Time of $44.6 million and the addition of higher programming fees paid to affiliated networks of $30.5 million.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $22.3 million to reduce the value of one of the local media segment's FCC licenses.\nOperating Profit\nFiscal 2020 operating profit declined 48 percent primarily due to lower political advertising revenues of $79.0 million, an estimated reduction in operating profit of $32.9 million due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the non-cash impairment charge of $22.3 million.\nLocal media operating profit increased 49 percent in fiscal 2019 primarily due to the increase in high-margin political spot advertising revenues.\nUNALLOCATED CORPORATE EXPENSES\nUnallocated corporate expenses are general corporate overhead expenses not attributable to the operating groups. These expenses for the last three fiscal years were as follows:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended June 30,\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities\n</td> <td>22.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated corporate expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnallocated corporate expenses decreased 38 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to decreases in integration and exit costs of $22.7 million, performance-based compensation expenses of $17.2 million, employee-related compensation costs of $6.1 million, and consulting services expenses of $4.3 million partially offset by increases in other miscellaneous business expenses.\nUnallocated corporate expenses decreased $67.5 million in fiscal 2019 primarily due to decreases in severance and related benefit expenses of $47.1 million, a reduction in transaction and integration-related costs of $17.2 million, and absence of accelerated share-based compensation expenses of $9.2 million related to Time awards that vested upon acquisition in fiscal 2018 and of $3.5 million in accelerated share-based compensation expense related to involuntary terminations. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $9.2 million in consulting services expense.\nOf the $17.2 million reduction in performance-based compensation expenses in fiscal 2020, the Company estimates that $4.4 million of that reduction was due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenues and operating results of the Company. Other than the reduction in performance-based compensation expenses and a reduction of $1.1 million in other expenses, the Company estimates that the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a significant impact on unallocated corporate operating costs and expenses during fiscal 2020. In addition, the Company does not anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a significant impact on unallocated corporate operating costs and expenses in fiscal 2021.\nCONSOLIDATED\nConsolidated Operating Expenses\nConsolidated operating expenses for the last three fiscal years were as follows:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended June 30,\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Production, distribution, and editorial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,047.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,161.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>868.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general, and administrative\n</td> <td>1,259.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,350.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>987.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities\n</td> <td>26.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>219.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>247.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets\n</td> <td>389.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,942.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,901.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,177.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>n/m - Not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduction, Distribution, and Editorial Costs\nProduction, distribution, and editorial costs decreased 10 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower combined production, distribution, and paper costs of $86.4 million and a decline in non-payroll related editorial costs of $48.0 million partially offset by an increase in programming fees paid to affiliated networks of $27.2 million.\nFiscal 2019 production, distribution, and editorial costs increased 34 percent as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the addition of production, distribution, and editorial costs of Time of $290.5 million and increases in programming fees paid to affiliated networks of $30.5 million. These increases were partially offset by declines in production, distribution, and editorial expenses of MXM of $26.9 million.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses declined 7 percent primarily due to a reduction in employee compensation costs of $49.0 million, decreases in performance-based compensation expenses of $26.5 million, and a reduction in third party acquisition costs of $17.5 million.\nFiscal 2019 selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 37 percent primarily due to an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses of Time in our national and local media segments of $406.0 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses of MXM of $60.0 million.\nAcquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities\nAcquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities expense declined by 73 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to reductions in severance and related benefit costs of $36.7 million and declines in integration and exit costs of $41.0 million.\nFiscal 2019 acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities expense primarily included $51.5 million of severance and related benefit costs and $64.6 million of integration costs primarily for business advisors and software and systems implementations and modifications, and a credit for a gain on the sale of the Company's 30 percent interest in Charleston Tennis of $6.4 million.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased 11 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily due to reductions in depreciation expense of $18.6 million and in amortization expense of $11.4 million in our national media segment.\nThe increase in fiscal 2019 depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the addition of Time's depreciation and amortization expense.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Long-lived Assets\nThe Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $252.7 million in fiscal 2020 to reduce the carrying value of the national media segment's goodwill. In addition, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $87.9 million in the national media segment related to vacant leased space at its location in New York City. The Company also recorded non-cash impairment charges of $26.4 million to reduce the value of several of the national media segment's trademarks and $22.3 million to reduce the value of one of the local media segment's FCC licenses. The magnitude of the impairments of goodwill and other long-lived assets were unfavorably impacted by the volatility of the financial markets and the uncertainty surrounding the long-term economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe impairment of long-lived assets recorded in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 related primarily to non-cash impairments of trademarks in the national media segment.\nOperating Expenses\nEmployee compensation, including benefits, was the largest component of our operating expenses in fiscal 2020. Employee compensation represented 23 percent of total operating expenses in fiscal 2020, compared to 26 percent\nin fiscal 2019, and 38 percent in fiscal 2018. National media paper, production, and postage combined expense was the second largest component of our operating costs in fiscal 2020, representing 13 percent of the total. These expenses were 15 percent of total operating expenses in fiscal 2019 and 14 percent of total operating expenses in fiscal 2018.\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\nFiscal 2020 loss from operations of $94.1 million was a decrease of $381.1 million from fiscal 2019 income from operations of $287.0 million. The decrease is primarily due to non-cash impairment charges of $389.3 million. Absent impairment charges in both years, fiscal 2020 income from operations would have been $295.2 million, a decrease of 10 percent compared to $328.8 million in fiscal 2019, primarily due to an estimated impact from the COVID-19 pandemic of $83.1 million and a reduction in political revenues of $79.0 million more than offsetting a reduction in acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities of $74.1 million, a decrease in depreciation and amortization of $27.7 million, and a decline in performance-based compensation expenses of $17.3 million.\nFiscal 2019 income from operations of $287.0 million increased $200.1 million primarily due to the increase in operating profit of our local media segment of $91.7 million resulting from the cyclical nature of political advertising, the addition of operating income from Time of $79.7 million, and a reduction in acquisition, disposition, and restructuring related activities of $69.2 million.\nNon-operating Income (Expense), net\nFiscal 2020 net non-operating expense was $1.3 million as compared to fiscal 2019 net non-operating income of $24.2 million. The change was primarily due to an increase in pension settlement charges of $16.4 million and the reduction in the pension and other postretirement plans benefit credits $10.7 million.\nNet non-operating income was $24.2 million in fiscal 2019, an increase of $23.5 million from $0.7 million in fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the pension and other postretirement plans benefit credit and a gain on the sale of the Company's 30 percent interest in Charleston Tennis, which was sold in September 2018.\nInterest Expense, net\nNet interest expense was $145.8 million in fiscal 2020, $170.6 million in fiscal 2019, and $97.2 million in fiscal 2018. Average long-term debt outstanding was $2.4 billion in fiscal 2020, $2.7 billion in fiscal 2019, and $1.9 billion in fiscal 2018. The Company's approximate weighted average interest rate was 6.1 percent in fiscal 2020, 7.1 percent in fiscal 2019, and 5.1 percent in fiscal 2018. The weighted average interest rates include the effects of extinguishment losses during fiscal 2019 and 2018, and derivative financial instruments until their termination in January 2018.\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $10.9 million of extinguishment losses related to the early payment of debt and repricing of its senior secured term loan (Term Loan B). During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Company's acquisition of Time, the Company repaid and terminated Meredith's existing indebtedness. In connection with the payoff of this indebtedness, Meredith recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.2 million. In conjunction with the repayment of its debt, the Company also settled the associated interest rate swap agreements and recognized a gain on the settlement of $1.6 million. In addition, the Company incurred $17.5 million in fees that were recorded in interest expense related to an undrawn bridge loan commitment fee.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 13.3 percent in fiscal 2020, 8.2 percent in fiscal 2019, and 1,282.4 percent in fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2020, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $32.2 million for an effective rate of 13.3 percent. The fiscal 2020 effective tax rate was impacted primarily by the national media goodwill impairment charge. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $252.7 million\nto reduce the carrying value of goodwill. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $26.9 million related to this goodwill impairment charge.\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company recorded income tax expense of $11.5 million for an effective rate of 8.2 percent. The fiscal 2019 effective tax rate was primarily impacted by a credit to income taxes of $23.5 million related to write-off of worthless stock and related bad debt. For fiscal 2018, Meredith recorded a tax benefit of $123.6 million primarily reflecting the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities and a reduced tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. This tax benefit was offset in part by non-deductible expenses including transaction costs.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Act, which significantly changed previous U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and other changes such as bonus depreciation that allows for full expensing of qualified property and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and certain executive compensation. For fiscal 2018, the change in the corporate tax rate resulted in a blended U.S. federal statutory rate for the Company of 28.1 percent.\nIn connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we recorded a provisional net tax benefit of $133.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2018."}
