Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company has applied the FAST Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K that was adopted by the SEC on March 20, 2019, which allows registrants providing financial statements covering three years in a filing to exclude discussion of the earliest of the three years in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\". The information covered here provides a comparison of material changes in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018. For the comparison of fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017, see Part II, \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 14, 2019.\nExecutive Overview\nNet loss attributable to Equitrans Midstream was $203.7 million in 2019 compared with net income attributable to Equitrans Midstream of $218.4 million in 2018. The decrease resulted primarily from increased impairments to long-lived assets (as discussed in Note 3), higher net interest expense associated with increased long-term debt outstanding, higher other operating expenses and lower net income attributable to noncontrolling interests partly offset by higher gathering revenues primarily associated with the operating entities acquired with the Bolt-on Acquisition, higher equity income from EQM's investment in the MVP Joint Venture and lower income tax expense.\nOn January 15, 2020, the Board declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2019 of $0.45 per share payable on February 21, 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 11, 2020.\nThe following table reconciles the differences between operating income attributable to EQM as reported in EQM's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and operating income attributable to Equitrans Midstream for the same periods.\nTable 255: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income attributable to EQM\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>204,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>726,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Separation and other transaction costs\n</td> <td>6,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of long-lived assets\n</td> <td>114,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additional expenses, net\n</td> <td>6,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income attributable to Equitrans Midstream\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>643,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSeparation and Other Transaction Costs. Separation and other transaction costs primarily represented expenses related to the EQGP Buyout, the EQM IDR Transaction and the Separation for the year ended December 31, 2019. Separation and other transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily related to the Rice Merger, the EQM-RMP Mergers, the Drop-Down Transaction, the Separation, the EQGP Buyout and the EQM IDR Transaction (which included charges from EQT). Separation costs recorded in 2018 also included a one-time charitable contribution of $15.0 million made to the Equitrans Midstream Foundation, a charitable organization established to continue EQT's legacy of charitable giving. Future contributions to the Equitrans Midstream Foundation, if any, will be evaluated from time to time.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets. The Company recognized $115.0 million of additional goodwill impairment primarily related to the Rice Retained Midstream reporting unit (see Note 3).\nAdditional Expenses, Net. As a result of being a publicly traded company, the Company incurs additional operating expenses separate from and in addition to similar costs incurred by EQM.\nBusiness Segment Results\nOperating segments are revenue-producing components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is produced internally and is subject to evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources. Other income, net interest expense and income tax expense are managed on a consolidated basis. The Company has presented each segment's operating income, equity income and various operational measures in the following sections. Management believes that the presentation of this information is useful to management and investors regarding the financial condition, results of operations and trends of its segments. The Company has reconciled each segment's operating income to the Company's consolidated operating income and net income in Note 6.\nGATHERING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table 256: <table><tr><td> </td>

Firm reservation fee revenues increased approximately $133.8 million primarily as a result of increased revenues generated under agreements with MVCs and revenues generated by the entities acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition, as well as higher rates on various wellhead expansion projects in 2019. Volumetric-based fee revenues increased approximately $29.1 million due to revenues generated by the entities acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition.\nGathering operating expenses increased by $675.1 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily as a result of approximately $854.3 million in impairment charges in 2019, of which $736.8 million related to impairments of goodwill, $81.0 million was associated with an impairment to certain low-pressure gathering assets and $36.4 million related to an impairment of intangible\nassets (as discussed in Note 3), an approximate $45.6 million increase in depreciation expense as a result of additional assets placed in-service, as well as depreciation on assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition and the Shared Assets Transaction, and an approximate $17.0 million increase in operating and maintenance expense primarily associated with the operations of entities acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition and increased personnel costs, partly offset by a decrease to repairs and maintenance expense. In addition, EQM recognized an increase to separation and other transaction costs of approximately $11.6 million primarily associated with the Bolt-on Acquisition. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $3.2 million primarily due to lower corporate overhead and personnel costs, partly offset by an increase in information technology related expenses and an increase in expenses associated with the entities acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition.\nSee \"Outlook\" and Note 3 for further discussion of the impairment of long-lived assets.\nSee also Outlook\u201d and Note 18 for a discussion of the EQT Global GGA with EQT and the Credit Letter Agreement, and the transactions related thereto, including the potential cash fee relief related to the MVP in-service date. The Company expects that the revenues resulting from the MVCs provided in the EQT Global GGA will increase the proportion of the Company's total operating revenues that are firm reservation fee revenues in future periods.\nTRANSMISSION RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table 259: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The decrease in operating and maintenance expense and selling, general and administrative expense was partly offset by an increase in depreciation expense due to additional assets placed in service.\nEquity income increased by $101.5 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the increase in the MVP Joint Venture's AFUDC on the MVP as a result of continued spending on the project.\nWATER RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table 261: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FINANCIAL DATA\n</td> <td>(Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water service revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>717.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating and maintenance\n</td> <td>34,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>688.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>2,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,598.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>26,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>568.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>64,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>677.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>808.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPERATIONAL DATA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water services volumes (MMgal)\n</td> <td>1,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>823.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 262: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Includes the pre-acquisition results of the EQM-RMP Mergers, which were effective July 23, 2018.

As a result, the financial statements include the income taxes incurred by the Company computed on a separate return basis. EQM, Eureka Midstream and EQGP are limited partnerships for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes and are not subject to U.S. federal or state income taxes. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, Rice Midstream Holdings LLC (Rice Midstream Holdings) was a multi-member LLC and was not subject to U.S. federal or state income taxes. In the fourth quarter of 2018, prior to the Separation, Rice Midstream Holdings was merged out of existence as part of internal restructurings.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Reform Legislation), which made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law, including lowering the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% beginning January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Legislation contains several other provisions, such as limiting the utilization of net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017 that are carried into future years to 80% of taxable income and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense, which are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's results of operations. As of December 31, 2018, the Company completed its accounting for the effects of the Tax Reform Legislation, including accounting for the revaluation of net deferred tax assets and for state income tax effects, and recorded deferred income tax expense of $7.4 million, which is in addition to the $129.3 million of deferred income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company also considered whether existing deferred tax assets will be recovered in future periods under this legislation and noted no significant effect on the deferred tax assets.\nAll of EQM, Eureka Midstream and, for the period prior to the EQGP Buyout, EQGP income is included in the Company's pre-tax income; however, the Company does not record income tax expense on the portions of its income attributable to the noncontrolling limited partners of EQM, the noncontrolling members of Eureka Midstream, the noncontrolling limited partners of EQGP (for the period prior to the EQGP Buyout) and, for the period prior to May 1, 2018, the noncontrolling member of Strike Force Midstream. This reduces the Company's effective tax rate in periods when the Company has consolidated pre-tax income. Also, given that Rice Midstream Holdings was a multi-member limited liability company prior to October 22, 2018, the Company was not required to record income tax expense on Rice Midstream Holdings' income during such prior periods.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's noncontrolling interests included the third-party ownership interests in EQM. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and specifically for the period from April 10, 2019 to December 31, 2019, the Company's noncontrolling interests also included third-party ownership interests in Eureka Midstream, as well as the Series A Preferred Unit interests in EQM's net income. For the period beginning January 1, 2019 and ending January 10, 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company's noncontrolling interests included third-party ownership interests in EQGP. For the periods in 2018 prior to the Company's acquisition of their remaining respective noncontrolling interests, the Company's noncontrolling interests also included the third-party ownership interests in RMP and Gulfport Midstream's 25% ownership interest in Strike Force Midstream.\nThe noncontrolling interests described above resulted in net income allocations to noncontrolling interests in the statements of consolidated comprehensive income. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests fluctuates based on the amount of net income earned by the entities with noncontrolling interests, the amount of net income allocated to EQM's IDRs prior to the EQM IDR Transaction, the amount of net income allocated to the Class B units subsequent to the EQM IDR Transaction, the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest related to the third-party ownership interests in Eureka\nMidstream, the amount of net income attributable to the Series A Preferred Units and any changes in the noncontrolling ownership percentages.\nSee \"Investing Activities\" and \"Capital Requirements\" under \"Capital Resources and Liquidity\" for discussion of capital expenditures.\nOutlook\nThe Company's assets overlay core acreage in the Appalachian Basin. The location of the Company's assets allows it to access major demand markets in the U.S. The Company is one of the largest natural gas gatherers in the U.S., and its largest customer, EQT, is the largest natural gas producer in the U.S. based on produced volumes. The Company maintains a stable cash flow profile, with approximately 58% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 generated by firm reservation fees and MVCs. Further, the percentage of the Company's revenues that are generated by firm reservation fees and MVCs is expected to increase in future years as a result of the EQT Global GGA, which includes an MVC effective on February 26, 2020 of 3.0 Bcf per day, which ramps up to 4.0 Bcf per day in future periods following the in-service date of the MVP project.\nThe Company's principal strategy is to achieve the scale and scope of a top-tier midstream company by leveraging its existing assets, executing on its growth projects and, where appropriate, seeking and executing on strategically-aligned acquisition and joint venture opportunities, while strengthening its balance sheet through (i) highly predictable cash flows backed by MVCs and firm reservation fees, (ii) actions to delever its balance sheet, (iii) disciplined capital spending, (iv) operating cost control and (v) an appropriate distribution policy. As part of its approach to organic growth, the Company is focused on building and completing its key transmission and gathering growth projects outlined under \"Strategy\" in \"Item 1. Business,\" many of which are supported by contracts with firm capacity commitments. Additionally, the Company is targeting growth from volumetric gathering and transmission opportunities and from its water services business, which is complementary to its gathering business.\nOn February 27, 2020, the Company and EQM announced the EQT Global GGA with EQT, which is a 15-year contract that includes, among other things, a 3.0 Bcf per day MVC (which gradually steps up to 4.0 Bcf per day for several years following the in-service date of the MVP project) and the dedication of a substantial majority of EQT's core acreage in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to the Company, and EQT received certain gathering fee relief over a period of three years following the in-service date of the MVP. The EQT Global GGA replaced 14 previous gathering agreements between affiliates of EQT and the Company. In addition, on February 27, 2020, the Company and EQM announced a definitive merger agreement between the Company, EQM and certain of their affiliates related to the EQM Merger, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company will acquire all of the issued and outstanding EQM common units (other than EQM common units held by the Company and its subsidiaries). Following the EQM Merger, which is subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals of EQM's limited partners and the Company's shareholders, EQM will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and will no longer be a public entity. The Company expects the EQM Merger to close in mid-2020. See Note 18 for additional information regarding the EQT Global GGA, the EQM Merger and the transactions related thereto.\nFor further discussion of key growth projects, see \"Strategy\" in \"Item 1. Business.\" For further discussion of capital expenditures, see \"Capital Requirements.\"\nCommodity Prices. The Company's business is dependent on continued natural gas production and the availability and development of reserves in its areas of operation. Low prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids have adversely affected development of additional reserves and production that is accessible by EQM's pipeline and storage assets, which also negatively affects EQM's water services business. The Henry Hub natural gas price ranged from $2.02 per MMbtu to $4.25 per MMbtu between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019, and the natural gas forward strip price trended downwards during 2019 and in early 2020, and is expected to remain depressed for several years. Further, market prices for natural gas in the Appalachian Basin continue to be lower than Henry Hub natural gas prices. Lower natural gas prices have caused producers to determine to reduce their rig count or otherwise take actions to slow production growth and/or reduce production, which in turn reduces the demand for, and usage of, EQM's services. A sustained period of depressed natural gas production and prices could cause producers in EQM's areas of operation to take further actions to reduce natural gas production and supply in the future. EQM's customers, including EQT, have announced reductions in their capital spending and may continue to lower capital spending in the future based on commodity prices, access to capital, investor expectations for positive free cash flow, a desire to reduce leverage or other factors. On January 13, 2020, EQT publicly announced a 2020 capital expenditure forecast of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion, compared to 2019 capital expenditures of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion, which represents an approximate 30% decrease in capital expenditures compared to EQT's projected 2019 capital expenditures. Longer-term price declines could continue to have an adverse effect on customers' creditworthiness and related ability to pay firm reservation fees under long-term contracts and/or affect activity levels and, accordingly, volumetric-based fees which could affect the\nCompany's results of operations, liquidity or financial position. For example, on February 3, 2020, S&P took negative rating actions on nine Appalachian exploration and production companies citing lower natural gas price assumptions. Many of EQM's customers, including EQT, have entered into long-term firm reservation transmission and gathering contracts or contracts with MVCs on EQM's systems. However, approximately 49.9% of EQM's gathering revenues and 8.7% of EQM's transmission revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were from volumetric-based fee revenues. Additionally, EQM's water service agreements are primarily volumetric in nature. For more information see \"Decreases in production of natural gas in EQM's areas of operation have adversely affected, and future decreases could further adversely affect, its business and operating results and reduce its cash available to make distributions to its unitholders, including us\" included in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to EQM's Business.\"\nPotential Future Impairments. During 2019, the Company recognized an impairment to goodwill of approximately $851.8 million, including $602.1 million, $150.5 million, and $99.2 million associated with its RMP PA Gas Gathering, Rice Retained Midstream and Eureka/Hornet reporting units, respectively. In addition, the Company recognized a $36.4 million impairment related to certain Hornet Midstream-related intangible assets during the third quarter of 2019. See Note 3 for additional information. On January 13, 2020, EQT publicly announced an approximately 30% decrease in capital expenditures for 2020 compared to 2019 capital expenditures. In connection with the execution of the EQT Global GGA, management will reevaluate the Company's reporting units. In connection with the execution of the EQT Global GGA, management may be required to reevaluate the Company's reporting units under the provisions in ASC 350. If, as a result of this reevaluation, management identifies that a change to the current reporting units is warranted, management will assess the goodwill for impairment before and after the change in the reporting units.\nDepending on the location and timing of EQT's 2020 drilling activity, EQT's planned reductions in its drilling and completions activity, as well as reductions in drilling and completions activity by other producers, the Company may recognize additional goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges in future periods. The Company continues to receive and evaluate drilling plan information from EQT and other producers for 2020 and future years. As of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company cannot predict the likelihood or magnitude of any future impairment. See also \"Reviews of our goodwill and intangible and other long-lived assets have resulted in and could result in future significant impairment charges\" included in \"Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Related to EQM's Business\" and the Company's discussion on \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" under \"Outlook\" included in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\"\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nThe Company's liquidity requirements are to finance EQM's operations, EQM's capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions and capital contributions to joint ventures, including the MVP Joint Venture, pay cash dividends and distributions and satisfy any indebtedness obligations. The Company's ability to meet these liquidity requirements depends on the cash flow from operations (through EQM operations) and the Company's and EQM's ability to raise capital in banking, capital and other markets. The Company's available sources of liquidity include cash from operations (as distributed to the Company by EQM), incremental borrowings under revolving credit facilities, cash on hand and issuances of additional debt or equity securities by the Company or EQM. Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement (defined in Note 9), the Company is subject to certain restrictions related to certain corporate actions, including restrictions related to the issuance of the Company and EQM securities beyond certain thresholds as set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement for a two-year period following the Separation and Distribution. See \"We and EQM may determine to forgo or be required to forgo certain transactions in order to avoid the risk of incurring material tax-related liabilities or indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\" under \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Separation\" included in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" EQM is not forecasting any public equity issuance for currently anticipated organic growth projects.\nIn February 2020, S&P and Fitch downgraded EQM's credit ratings to non-investment grade and further downgraded the Company's credit ratings. As a result of the downgrades, each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch have assigned non-investment grade credit ratings to the Company and EQM. The non-investment grade ratings have caused EQM to incur higher borrowing costs under the EQM Credit Facility and 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement. In addition, as a result of the downgrades, EQM was obligated to deliver additional credit support to the MVP Joint Venture, which included letters of credit in the amounts of approximately $220.2 million and $14.2 million with respect to the MVP project and MVP Southgate project, respectively. See \"A further downgrade of EQM's credit ratings, including in connection with the MVP project or changes in the credit ratings of EQT, which are determined by independent third parties, could impact EQM's liquidity, access to capital, and costs of doing business.\" and \"The credit and risk profile of EQM affect our credit ratings and risk profile, and any adverse changes in EQM's credit and risk profile could increase our borrowing costs or hinder our ability to raise capital.\" under \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $976.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $721.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven primarily by the timing of payments from working capital.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash flows used in investing activities were $2,574.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1,786.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash used was primarily attributable to the cost of the Bolt-on Acquisition in 2019 and increased capital expenditures in 2019 relative to 2018 as further described in \"Capital Requirements,\" partly offset by decreased capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture consistent with the timing of construction for the MVP and MVP Southgate projects in 2019 relative to 2018.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities were $1,392.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1,237.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the primary sources of financing cash flows were borrowings on the Company's and EQM's credit facilities, proceeds from the issuance of the term loans under the 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement (defined in Note 11), which were used primarily to pay down borrowings under the EQM Credit Facility, and the net proceeds from the issuance of the Series A Preferred Units, which were used in part to fund the purchase price of the Bolt-on Acquisition and to pay certain fees and expenses related to the Bolt-on Acquisition, while the primary uses of financing cash flows were payments on the Company's and EQM's credit facility borrowings, the payment of dividends, the payments of distributions to noncontrolling interest unitholders, the Company's purchase of EQGP common units and the payment of distributions to Series A Preferred unitholders. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the primary sources of financing cash flows were proceeds from the issuance of the EQM $2.5 Billion Senior Notes and the Term Loans (defined in Note 11) and net credit facility borrowings, while the primary uses of financing cash flows were net distributions to EQT, distributions paid to noncontrolling interest unitholders, the EQGP Unit Purchases (defined in Note 7) and the Gulfport Transaction (defined in Note 1).\nCapital Requirements\nThe gathering, transmission and storage and water service businesses are capital intensive, requiring significant investment to develop new facilities and to maintain and upgrade existing operations.\nTable 263: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expansion capital expenditures (a)(b)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>866,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>803,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>328,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital expenditures\n</td> <td>65,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Headquarters capital expenditures\n</td> <td>9,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures (b)\n</td> <td>941,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>884,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>371,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: accrued capital expenditures at the end of prior period (c)\n</td> <td>109,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: accrued capital expenditures at acquisition on April 10, 2019 (c)\n</td> <td>8,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: accrued capital expenditures at acquisition on November 13, 2017 (c)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: accrued capital expenditures at the end of current period (c)\n</td> <td>(91,998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(109,347\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90,655\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>967,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>865,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>380,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 264: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Expansion capital expenditures do not include capital contributions made to the MVP Joint Venture of $774.6 million, $913.2 million and $159.6 million related to the MVP and MVP Southgate projects for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 265: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Includes approximately $22.5 million of expansion capital expenditures and $3.4 million of maintenance capital expenditures related to noncontrolling interests in Eureka Midstream for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 266: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(c)\n</td> <td>The Company accrues capital expenditures when capital work has been completed but the associated bills have not been paid.

In 2019, expansion capital expenditures reflected investments in the assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition, the EQM-RMP Mergers and the Drop-Down Transaction, as well as the Hammerhead project and various wellhead gathering expansion projects, partly offset by decreased spending on the Equitrans, L.P. Expansion project. In 2018, expansion capital expenditures reflected primarily investments in the assets acquired in the EQM-RMP Mergers and the Drop-Down Transaction and in the following projects: the Hammerhead project, the Equitrans L.P. Expansion project, various wellhead gathering expansion projects and the Range Resources header pipeline project.\nMaintenance capital expenditures are expenditures made to maintain, over the long term, EQM's operating capacity or operating income. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures to repair, refurbish and replace pipelines, to connect new wells to maintain throughput, to maintain equipment reliability, integrity and safety and to address environmental laws and regulations. Maintenance capital expenditures increased by $13.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily as a result of maintenance associated with the assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition, additional assets placed in service and the timing of ongoing maintenance projects.\nIn connection with the Separation, the Company assumed all of EQT's obligations to indemnify and reimburse EQM under EQM's omnibus agreement with EQT other than for those losses or expenses relating to or arising from plugging and abandonment obligations. During 2019, the Company reimbursed EQM approximately $0.7 million associated with bare steel replacement capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's reimbursement obligations associated with bare steel replacement capital expenditures had been capped. Please read \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Agreements with EQT-Omnibus Agreement.\"\nIn 2020, EQM expects to make capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture of $650 million to $700 million depending on the timing of the construction of the MVP project and approximately $50 million for the MVP Southgate project. Expansion capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $525 million (exclusive of approximately $40 million attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Eureka Midstream) and maintenance capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $55 million (exclusive of approximately $5 million attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Eureka Midstream), net of expected reimbursements. Future capital investments may vary significantly from period to period based on the available investment opportunities and the timing of the construction of the MVP, MVP Southgate and other projects. Maintenance capital expenditures are also expected to vary quarter to quarter. EQM expects to fund future capital expenditures primarily through cash on hand, cash generated from operations, borrowings under its and its subsidiaries' respective credit facilities (including term loan agreements), debt transactions and issuances of additional EQM partnership units. EQM is not forecasting any public equity issuance for currently anticipated organic growth projects.\nCredit Facilities\nSee Note 11 for discussion of the Company's and its subsidiaries' credit facilities. See Note 18 for additional information on the proposed Intercompany Loan and the anticipated termination of the ETRN Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nSecurity Ratings\nThe table below sets forth the credit ratings for debt instruments of the Company and EQM at December 31, 2019.\nTable 267: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Equitrans Midstream\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>EQM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Term Loan B\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Senior Notes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating Service\n</td> <td>Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outlook\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's\n</td> <td>Ba3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ba1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P\n</td> <td>BB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Negative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Negative\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch\n</td> <td>BB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Negative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Negative\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn January 31, 2020, Moody's affirmed the Company's Ba3 and EQM's Ba1 credit ratings but changed its outlook from stable to negative, citing uncertainty around the MVP project and EQT's weakening credit profile. On February 4, 2020, S&P downgraded the Company's credit rating to a BB- rating, with a negative outlook, from a BB rating. S&P also downgraded EQM's credit to a BB+ rating, with a negative outlook, from a BBB- rating. On February 27, 2020, S&P further downgraded EQM's credit to a BB rating, with a stable outlook, but upgraded the Company's credit rating to BB, with a stable outlook. Further, on February 18, 2020, Fitch downgraded EQM to a BB rating, with a negative outlook, from a BBB- rating, citing a downgrade of EQT's credit rating from BBB- to BB, with a negative outlook, on February 14, 2020, as well as uncertainty around the MVP project, as the principal reasons for the ratings action. Additionally, on February 18, 2020, Fitch downgraded the Company's credit rating from BB to B+ with a negative outlook credit rating and the credit rating specific to the Company's\nterm loan B from BB to B with a negative outlook. The Company's and EQM's credit ratings are subject to further revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The Company and EQM cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant, including in connection with the MVP project or the creditworthiness of EQM's customers, including EQT. As of December 31, 2019, EQT's public debt had an investment grade rating, but was on negative outlook with Moody's, S&P and Fitch. On January 13, 2020, Moody's downgraded EQT's senior unsecured rating to Ba1 with a negative outlook, from Baa3 with a negative outlook. On February 3, 2020, S&P downgraded EQT's senior unsecured rating to BB+ with a negative outlook, from BBB- with a negative outlook. Further, on February 14, 2020, Fitch downgraded EQT's senior unsecured rating to BB with a negative outlook, from BBB-. If any credit rating agency further downgrades the Company's or EQM's ratings, the Company's and EQM's access to the capital markets may be limited, borrowing costs could increase, EQM may be required to provide additional credit assurances in support of commercial agreements such as joint venture agreements and, if applicable, construction contracts, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease. In order to be considered investment grade, a company must be rated Baa3 or higher by Moody's, BBB- or higher by S&P, or BBB- or higher by Fitch. Anything below these ratings, including all of the Company's and EQM's credit ratings are considered non-investment grade.\nSchedule of Contractual Obligations\nThe following represents the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019.

While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the Company and EQM are unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. The Company and EQM accrue legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when incurred. Each of the Company and EQM, as applicable, establishes reserves whenever it believes it to be appropriate for pending matters. Furthermore, after consultation with counsel and considering available insurance, the Company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against it, EQM or any of their respective subsidiaries will not materially affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.\nSee \"The regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is challenging, and recent decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending proceedings could impact EQM's or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the projected time frame or at all or EQM's ability to achieve the expected investment return on the projects.\" under \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to EQM's Business\" included in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" and see \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" for discussion of litigation and regulatory proceedings related to the MVP project.\nSee Note 14 for further discussion of the Company's commitments and contingencies.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSee Note 8 for discussion of the MVP Joint Venture guarantees.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRecently issued accounting standards relevant to the Company are described in Note 1.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The following critical accounting policies, which were reviewed by the Company's Audit Committee, relate to its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nIncome Taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements or tax returns.\nThe Company has federal and state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards related to federal and various state jurisdictions. The federal and states of Virginia and West Virginia NOL carryforwards have no expiration, but utilization is limited to 80% of taxable income in the year of utilization. The Company's Pennsylvania NOL carryforwards expire in 2039. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain federal and state NOL carryforwards will be realized. In addition to the NOL carryforwards, the Company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from its investments in partnerships. No valuation allowances have been established because the Company believes that future sources of taxable income, reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets. Any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the Company's income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made.\nValuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carry-back periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carry-forward period, including from tax planning strategies, and experience. The Company has not noted any significant negative evidence.\nDeferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized, and changes in facts and circumstances may result in the establishment of a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence that apply to valuation allowance establishment. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset for which a valuation is recorded will be realized, all or a portion of the valuation allowance may be released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates from law changes.\nTax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold; otherwise, the tax benefit is recorded when the tax position has been effectively settled, either because the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed its examination. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.\nThe Company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are \"critical accounting estimates\" because the Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, exercise judgment when evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions. To the extent that a valuation allowance or an uncertain tax position is established or increased or decreased during a period, the Company includes an expense or benefit within income tax expense on the statements of comprehensive income. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions. See Note 12 for additional information.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. Determination of depreciation requires judgment regarding the estimated useful lives and salvage values of property, plant and equipment. The Company has not historically experienced material changes in its results of operations from changes in the estimated useful lives or salvage values of its property, plant and equipment; however, these estimates are reviewed periodically, including each time Equitrans, L.P. files with the FERC for a change in its transmission, storage and gathering rates. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to depreciation is a \"critical accounting estimate\" because it is susceptible to change. These assumptions affect depreciation expense and, if changed, would have an effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 for additional information.\nImpairments of Long-Lived Assets, Including Intangible Assets and Goodwill. Any accounting estimate related to impairment of property, plant and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets, goodwill or an investment in an unconsolidated entity may require the Company's management to make assumptions about future cash flows, discount rates, the fair value of investments and whether losses in the value of its investments are other than temporary. Management's assumptions about future cash flows require significant judgment because actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future.\nGoodwill is the cost of an acquisition less the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company uses a combination of an income and market approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. See Notes 1 and 3 for additional information.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to impairments are \"critical accounting estimates\" because they require assumptions that are susceptible to change, including estimating fair value which requires considerable judgment. For goodwill, management's estimate of a reporting unit's future financial results is sensitive to changes in assumptions, such as changes in stock prices, weighted-average cost of capital, terminal growth rates and industry multiples. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions used in estimating its reporting units' fair values are reasonable and appropriate, however, different assumptions and estimates could materially affect the calculated fair value and the resulting conclusion on impairment of goodwill, which could materially affect the Company's results of operations and financial position. Additionally, actual results could differ from these estimates. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis for the RMP PA Gas Gathering reporting unit (defined and discussed in Note 1), which is the only reporting unit with goodwill as of December 31, 2019, to quantify the effect of certain changes to assumptions used in the goodwill assessment. It was determined that a 1% increase to the weighted average cost of capital and a corresponding 1% decrease to the terminal cash flow growth rate would have resulted in the Company's recognition of approximately $81.3 million of additional impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2019.\nThe Company's investments in unconsolidated entities also require considerable judgment to estimate fair value because the Company's investments are not traded on an active market. Additionally, investments in unconsolidated entities are susceptible to impairment risk from further adverse macroeconomic conditions or other adverse factors such as permit and litigation matters impacting the MVP project. Such matters could cause further significant delays in the timing and costs of the MVP project which could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges relating to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities.\nAny potential impairment would have an effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position. See Notes 1 and 3 for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue from the gathering, transmission and storage of natural gas is generally recognized when the service is provided. Revenue from water services is generally recognized when water is delivered. For all contracts, EQM allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the judgmentally determined relative standalone selling price. When applicable, the excess of consideration received over revenue recognized results in the deferral of those amounts until future periods based on a units of production or straight-line methodology as these methods appropriately match the consumption of services provided to the customer. The units of production methodology requires the use of production estimates that are uncertain and the use of judgment when developing estimates of future production volumes, thus impacting the rate of revenue recognition. Production estimates are monitored as circumstances and events warrant. Certain of our gas gathering and water agreements have MVCs. If a customer under such an agreement fails to meet its MVC for a specified period (thus not exercising all the contractual rights to gathering and water services within the specified period, herein referred to as breakage\u201d), it is obligated to pay a contractually determined fee based upon the shortfall between the actual gathered or water volumes and the MVC for the period contained in the contract. Based on management's judgment, it is probable that the customer will not exercise all or a portion of its remaining rights, we recognize revenue associated with such breakage amount in proportion to the pattern of exercised rights within the respective MVC period.\nRevenue related to services provided but not yet billed is estimated each month. These estimates are generally based on contract data, preliminary throughput and allocation measurements. Final bills for the current month are billed and collected in the following month. See Note 4 for additional information.\nEQM records a provision for accounts receivable that are estimated to be uncollectible. In order to calculate the appropriate provision, an estimated loss rate of accounts receivable as a percentage of total revenue is used. This estimated loss rate is applied to the outstanding accounts receivable and is updated periodically based on a customer's credit rating or other events that could impact the estimated loss rate, such as a significant change to the natural gas industry or to the economy as a whole. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis using the assumptions that apply at that time. While EQM has not historically experienced material bad debt expense, declines in the market price for natural gas affecting producer activity combined with the increase in customers on EQM's systems may result in a greater exposure to potential losses than management's current estimates.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to revenue recognition are \"critical accounting estimates\" because estimated volumes are subject to change based on actual measurements, including prior period adjustments. In addition, the Company believes that the accounting estimates related to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable are \"critical accounting estimates\" because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change and the actual mix of customers and their ability to pay may vary significantly from management's estimates, which could affect the collectability of customer accounts. These accounting estimates could potentially have a material effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.\nBusiness Combinations. During the second quarter of 2019, EQM recorded the Bolt-on Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting; accordingly, the values assigned to the assets and liabilities are based on EQM's purchase price accounting estimates. Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires a company to record the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities at fair value. The estimated fair value of midstream facilities and equipment, which generally consist of pipeline systems and compression stations, was estimated using the cost approach. Significant unobservable inputs in the estimate of fair value include management's assumptions about the replacement costs for similar assets, the relative age of the acquired assets and any potential economic or functional obsolescence associated with the acquired assets. The fair value of intangible assets was determined using the income approach, which requires a forecast of the expected future cash flows generated and an estimated market-based weighted average cost of capital. Significant unobservable inputs in the determination of fair value include future revenue estimates, future cost assumptions and estimated customer retention rates.\nGiven the time required to obtain pertinent information necessary to finalize the allocation of the purchase price to the acquired net assets, the purchase price allocation remained preliminary for a period of time before the required fair value estimates were finalized. It is not uncommon for the initial estimates to be subsequently revised. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Bolt-on Acquisition purchase price accounting was finalized. See Note 2 for further information.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to business combinations are \"critical accounting estimates\" because in determining the fair value of assets acquired, assumptions must be made about projections regarding the timing and amount of future development and operating costs and projections of replacement costs of and future cash flows from midstream assets and cash flows from customer relationships. Different assumptions may result in materially different values for these assets, which would affect the Company's future results of operations and financial position.\nShare-Based Compensation. The Company awards share-based compensation in connection with specific programs. Awards to employees are typically made in the form of performance-based awards, time-based restricted stock awards and time-based\nrestricted unit awards; and certain former employees were awarded stock options in the past. Awards to directors are typically made in the form of phantom units that vest upon grant.\nRestricted units and performance-based awards expected to be satisfied in cash are treated as liability awards. For liability awards, the Company is required to estimate, on the grant date and on each reporting date thereafter until vesting and payment, the fair value of the ultimate payout based upon the expected performance through, and value of the Company's common stock on, the vesting date. The Company then recognizes a proportionate amount of the expense for each period in the Company's financial statements over the vesting period of the award. The Company reviews its assumptions regarding performance and common stock value on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts.\nPerformance-based awards expected to be satisfied in Company common stock are treated as equity awards. For equity awards, the Company is required to determine the grant date fair value of the awards, which is then recognized as expense in the Company's financial statements over the vesting period of the award. Determination of the grant date fair value of the awards requires judgments and estimates regarding, among other things, the appropriate methodologies to follow in valuing the awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Most often, the Company is required to obtain a valuation based upon assumptions regarding risk-free rates of return, dividend yields, expected volatilities and the expected term of the award. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the Company's common stock adjusted for any expected changes and, where applicable, of the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company's common stock and, where applicable, the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant. The expected term represents the period of time elapsing during the applicable performance period.\nFor time-based restricted stock awards, the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as expense in the Company's financial statements over the vesting period, typically three years. For director phantom units (which vest on the date of grant) expected to be satisfied in equity, the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as an expense in the Company's financial statements in the year of grant. The grant date fair value, in both cases, is determined based upon the closing price of the Company's common stock on the day before the grant date.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to share-based compensation are \"critical accounting estimates\" because they may change from period to period based on changes in assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate payout of awards, including the number of awards to ultimately vest and the market price and volatility of the Company's common stock. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company has applied the FAST Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K that was adopted by the SEC on March 20, 2019, which allows registrants providing financial statements covering three years in a filing to exclude discussion of the earliest of the three years in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\". The information covered here provides a comparison of material changes in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018. For the comparison of fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017, see Part II, \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 14, 2019.\nExecutive Overview\nNet loss attributable to Equitrans Midstream was $203.7 million in 2019 compared with net income attributable to Equitrans Midstream of $218.4 million in 2018. The decrease resulted primarily from increased impairments to long-lived assets (as discussed in Note 3), higher net interest expense associated with increased long-term debt outstanding, higher other operating expenses and lower net income attributable to noncontrolling interests partly offset by higher gathering revenues primarily associated with the operating entities acquired with the Bolt-on Acquisition, higher equity income from EQM's investment in the MVP Joint Venture and lower income tax expense.\nOn January 15, 2020, the Board declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2019 of $0.45 per share payable on February 21, 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 11, 2020.\nThe following table reconciles the differences between operating income attributable to EQM as reported in EQM's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and operating income attributable to Equitrans Midstream for the same periods.\n\nSeparation and Other Transaction Costs. Separation and other transaction costs primarily represented expenses related to the EQGP Buyout, the EQM IDR Transaction and the Separation for the year ended December 31, 2019. Separation and other transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily related to the Rice Merger, the EQM-RMP Mergers, the Drop-Down Transaction, the Separation, the EQGP Buyout and the EQM IDR Transaction (which included charges from EQT). Separation costs recorded in 2018 also included a one-time charitable contribution of $15.0 million made to the Equitrans Midstream Foundation, a charitable organization established to continue EQT's legacy of charitable giving. Future contributions to the Equitrans Midstream Foundation, if any, will be evaluated from time to time.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets. The Company recognized $115.0 million of additional goodwill impairment primarily related to the Rice Retained Midstream reporting unit (see Note 3).\nAdditional Expenses, Net. As a result of being a publicly traded company, the Company incurs additional operating expenses separate from and in addition to similar costs incurred by EQM.\nBusiness Segment Results\nOperating segments are revenue-producing components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is produced internally and is subject to evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources. Other income, net interest expense and income tax expense are managed on a consolidated basis. The Company has presented each segment's operating income, equity income and various operational measures in the following sections. Management believes that the presentation of this information is useful to management and investors regarding the financial condition, results of operations and trends of its segments. The Company has reconciled each segment's operating income to the Company's consolidated operating income and net income in Note 6.\nGATHERING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n (a) Includes the pre-acquisition results of the Drop-Down Transaction and the EQM-RMP Mergers, which were effective May 1, 2018 and July 23, 2018, respectively. The recasts are for the period the acquired businesses were under the common control of EQT, which began on November 13, 2017 as a result of the Rice Merger. \n (b) Includes approximately $25.9 million of capital expenditures related to noncontrolling interests in Eureka Midstream for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nGathering operating revenues increased by $162.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018, driven primarily as a result of revenues generated by the entities acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition, as well as production development in the Marcellus and Utica Shales in 2019. Firm reservation fee revenues increased approximately $133.8 million primarily as a result of increased revenues generated under agreements with MVCs and revenues generated by the entities acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition, as well as higher rates on various wellhead expansion projects in 2019. Volumetric-based fee revenues increased approximately $29.1 million due to revenues generated by the entities acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition.\nGathering operating expenses increased by $675.1 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily as a result of approximately $854.3 million in impairment charges in 2019, of which $736.8 million related to impairments of goodwill, $81.0 million was associated with an impairment to certain low-pressure gathering assets and $36.4 million related to an impairment of intangible\nassets (as discussed in Note 3), an approximate $45.6 million increase in depreciation expense as a result of additional assets placed in-service, as well as depreciation on assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition and the Shared Assets Transaction, and an approximate $17.0 million increase in operating and maintenance expense primarily associated with the operations of entities acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition and increased personnel costs, partly offset by a decrease to repairs and maintenance expense. In addition, EQM recognized an increase to separation and other transaction costs of approximately $11.6 million primarily associated with the Bolt-on Acquisition. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $3.2 million primarily due to lower corporate overhead and personnel costs, partly offset by an increase in information technology related expenses and an increase in expenses associated with the entities acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition.\nSee \"Outlook\" and Note 3 for further discussion of the impairment of long-lived assets.\nSee also Outlook\u201d and Note 18 for a discussion of the EQT Global GGA with EQT and the Credit Letter Agreement, and the transactions related thereto, including the potential cash fee relief related to the MVP in-service date. The Company expects that the revenues resulting from the MVCs provided in the EQT Global GGA will increase the proportion of the Company's total operating revenues that are firm reservation fee revenues in future periods.\nTRANSMISSION RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n (a) Transmission capital expenditures do not include capital contributions made to the MVP Joint Venture for the MVP and MVP Southgate projects of approximately $774.6 million, $913.2 million and $159.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nTransmission operating revenues increased by approximately $3.7 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increased volumetric-based fee revenues due to an increase in pipeline throughput.\nTransmission operating expenses decreased by approximately $8.4 million in 2019 compared to 2018. Operating and maintenance expense decreased approximately $5.6 million primarily resulting from lower personnel costs and a decrease in repairs and maintenance expense. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased approximately $5.1 million resulting from lower corporate overhead and personnel costs. The decrease in operating and maintenance expense and selling, general and administrative expense was partly offset by an increase in depreciation expense due to additional assets placed in service.\nEquity income increased by $101.5 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the increase in the MVP Joint Venture's AFUDC on the MVP as a result of continued spending on the project.\nWATER RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n (a) Includes the pre-acquisition results of the EQM-RMP Mergers, which were effective July 23, 2018. The recast is for the period the acquired businesses were under the common control of EQT, which began on November 13, 2017 as a result of the Rice Merger.  Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nWater operating revenues decreased by $31.4 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to a reduction in fresh water distribution fees as the fee EQM charges per gallon of water is tiered and thus is lower on a per gallon basis once certain volumetric thresholds are met and a 13.4% decrease in fresh water distribution volumes associated with lower customer activity.\nWater operating expenses decreased by $9.1 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily as a result of decreased operating and maintenance expense associated with reduced operating activity and water procurement costs and decreased selling, general and administrative expense associated with lower corporate overhead and personnel costs, partly offset by increased depreciation expense as a result of additional assets placed in-service.\nOther Income Statement Items\nOther Income\nOther income decreased $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the net settlement of incentive compensation.\nNet Interest Expense\nNet interest expense increased by $140.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due primarily to higher interest expense of $64.8 million on the EQM $2.5 Billion Senior Notes (defined in Note 11), higher interest expense of $58.2 million associated with increased outstanding debt related to the ETRN Term Loan Credit Agreement (defined in Note 11) and the 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement (defined in Note 11), higher interest expense of $18.6 million on net credit facility borrowings (including borrowings under the Eureka Credit Facility (defined in Note 11)), a decrease in interest income earned on cash on hand of $12.1 million and higher amortization of debt issuance costs of $6.9 million, partly offset by increased capitalized interest and AFUDC - debt of $18.0 million.\nSee Notes 11 and 18 for discussion of the Company's, EQM's and Eureka Midstream's debt, as applicable.\nIncome Taxes\nSee Note 12 for an explanation of the decrease in income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe Company's operations had been included in EQT's consolidated income tax return for federal and state tax purposes prior to the Separation. As a result, the financial statements include the income taxes incurred by the Company computed on a separate return basis. EQM, Eureka Midstream and EQGP are limited partnerships for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes and are not subject to U.S. federal or state income taxes. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, Rice Midstream Holdings LLC (Rice Midstream Holdings) was a multi-member LLC and was not subject to U.S. federal or state income taxes. In the fourth quarter of 2018, prior to the Separation, Rice Midstream Holdings was merged out of existence as part of internal restructurings.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Reform Legislation), which made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law, including lowering the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% beginning January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Legislation contains several other provisions, such as limiting the utilization of net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017 that are carried into future years to 80% of taxable income and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense, which are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's results of operations. As of December 31, 2018, the Company completed its accounting for the effects of the Tax Reform Legislation, including accounting for the revaluation of net deferred tax assets and for state income tax effects, and recorded deferred income tax expense of $7.4 million, which is in addition to the $129.3 million of deferred income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company also considered whether existing deferred tax assets will be recovered in future periods under this legislation and noted no significant effect on the deferred tax assets.\nAll of EQM, Eureka Midstream and, for the period prior to the EQGP Buyout, EQGP income is included in the Company's pre-tax income; however, the Company does not record income tax expense on the portions of its income attributable to the noncontrolling limited partners of EQM, the noncontrolling members of Eureka Midstream, the noncontrolling limited partners of EQGP (for the period prior to the EQGP Buyout) and, for the period prior to May 1, 2018, the noncontrolling member of Strike Force Midstream. This reduces the Company's effective tax rate in periods when the Company has consolidated pre-tax income. Also, given that Rice Midstream Holdings was a multi-member limited liability company prior to October 22, 2018, the Company was not required to record income tax expense on Rice Midstream Holdings' income during such prior periods.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's noncontrolling interests included the third-party ownership interests in EQM. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and specifically for the period from April 10, 2019 to December 31, 2019, the Company's noncontrolling interests also included third-party ownership interests in Eureka Midstream, as well as the Series A Preferred Unit interests in EQM's net income. For the period beginning January 1, 2019 and ending January 10, 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company's noncontrolling interests included third-party ownership interests in EQGP. For the periods in 2018 prior to the Company's acquisition of their remaining respective noncontrolling interests, the Company's noncontrolling interests also included the third-party ownership interests in RMP and Gulfport Midstream's 25% ownership interest in Strike Force Midstream.\nThe noncontrolling interests described above resulted in net income allocations to noncontrolling interests in the statements of consolidated comprehensive income. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests fluctuates based on the amount of net income earned by the entities with noncontrolling interests, the amount of net income allocated to EQM's IDRs prior to the EQM IDR Transaction, the amount of net income allocated to the Class B units subsequent to the EQM IDR Transaction, the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest related to the third-party ownership interests in Eureka\nMidstream, the amount of net income attributable to the Series A Preferred Units and any changes in the noncontrolling ownership percentages.\nSee \"Investing Activities\" and \"Capital Requirements\" under \"Capital Resources and Liquidity\" for discussion of capital expenditures.\nOutlook\nThe Company's assets overlay core acreage in the Appalachian Basin. The location of the Company's assets allows it to access major demand markets in the U.S. The Company is one of the largest natural gas gatherers in the U.S., and its largest customer, EQT, is the largest natural gas producer in the U.S. based on produced volumes. The Company maintains a stable cash flow profile, with approximately 58% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 generated by firm reservation fees and MVCs. Further, the percentage of the Company's revenues that are generated by firm reservation fees and MVCs is expected to increase in future years as a result of the EQT Global GGA, which includes an MVC effective on February 26, 2020 of 3.0 Bcf per day, which ramps up to 4.0 Bcf per day in future periods following the in-service date of the MVP project.\nThe Company's principal strategy is to achieve the scale and scope of a top-tier midstream company by leveraging its existing assets, executing on its growth projects and, where appropriate, seeking and executing on strategically-aligned acquisition and joint venture opportunities, while strengthening its balance sheet through (i) highly predictable cash flows backed by MVCs and firm reservation fees, (ii) actions to delever its balance sheet, (iii) disciplined capital spending, (iv) operating cost control and (v) an appropriate distribution policy. As part of its approach to organic growth, the Company is focused on building and completing its key transmission and gathering growth projects outlined under \"Strategy\" in \"Item 1. Business,\" many of which are supported by contracts with firm capacity commitments. Additionally, the Company is targeting growth from volumetric gathering and transmission opportunities and from its water services business, which is complementary to its gathering business.\nOn February 27, 2020, the Company and EQM announced the EQT Global GGA with EQT, which is a 15-year contract that includes, among other things, a 3.0 Bcf per day MVC (which gradually steps up to 4.0 Bcf per day for several years following the in-service date of the MVP project) and the dedication of a substantial majority of EQT's core acreage in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to the Company, and EQT received certain gathering fee relief over a period of three years following the in-service date of the MVP. The EQT Global GGA replaced 14 previous gathering agreements between affiliates of EQT and the Company. In addition, on February 27, 2020, the Company and EQM announced a definitive merger agreement between the Company, EQM and certain of their affiliates related to the EQM Merger, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company will acquire all of the issued and outstanding EQM common units (other than EQM common units held by the Company and its subsidiaries). Following the EQM Merger, which is subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals of EQM's limited partners and the Company's shareholders, EQM will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and will no longer be a public entity. The Company expects the EQM Merger to close in mid-2020. See Note 18 for additional information regarding the EQT Global GGA, the EQM Merger and the transactions related thereto.\nFor further discussion of key growth projects, see \"Strategy\" in \"Item 1. Business.\" For further discussion of capital expenditures, see \"Capital Requirements.\"\nCommodity Prices. The Company's business is dependent on continued natural gas production and the availability and development of reserves in its areas of operation. Low prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids have adversely affected development of additional reserves and production that is accessible by EQM's pipeline and storage assets, which also negatively affects EQM's water services business. The Henry Hub natural gas price ranged from $2.02 per MMbtu to $4.25 per MMbtu between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019, and the natural gas forward strip price trended downwards during 2019 and in early 2020, and is expected to remain depressed for several years. Further, market prices for natural gas in the Appalachian Basin continue to be lower than Henry Hub natural gas prices. Lower natural gas prices have caused producers to determine to reduce their rig count or otherwise take actions to slow production growth and/or reduce production, which in turn reduces the demand for, and usage of, EQM's services. A sustained period of depressed natural gas production and prices could cause producers in EQM's areas of operation to take further actions to reduce natural gas production and supply in the future. EQM's customers, including EQT, have announced reductions in their capital spending and may continue to lower capital spending in the future based on commodity prices, access to capital, investor expectations for positive free cash flow, a desire to reduce leverage or other factors. On January 13, 2020, EQT publicly announced a 2020 capital expenditure forecast of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion, compared to 2019 capital expenditures of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion, which represents an approximate 30% decrease in capital expenditures compared to EQT's projected 2019 capital expenditures. Longer-term price declines could continue to have an adverse effect on customers' creditworthiness and related ability to pay firm reservation fees under long-term contracts and/or affect activity levels and, accordingly, volumetric-based fees which could affect the\nCompany's results of operations, liquidity or financial position. For example, on February 3, 2020, S&P took negative rating actions on nine Appalachian exploration and production companies citing lower natural gas price assumptions. Many of EQM's customers, including EQT, have entered into long-term firm reservation transmission and gathering contracts or contracts with MVCs on EQM's systems. However, approximately 49.9% of EQM's gathering revenues and 8.7% of EQM's transmission revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were from volumetric-based fee revenues. Additionally, EQM's water service agreements are primarily volumetric in nature. For more information see \"Decreases in production of natural gas in EQM's areas of operation have adversely affected, and future decreases could further adversely affect, its business and operating results and reduce its cash available to make distributions to its unitholders, including us\" included in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to EQM's Business.\"\nPotential Future Impairments. During 2019, the Company recognized an impairment to goodwill of approximately $851.8 million, including $602.1 million, $150.5 million, and $99.2 million associated with its RMP PA Gas Gathering, Rice Retained Midstream and Eureka/Hornet reporting units, respectively. In addition, the Company recognized a $36.4 million impairment related to certain Hornet Midstream-related intangible assets during the third quarter of 2019. See Note 3 for additional information. On January 13, 2020, EQT publicly announced an approximately 30% decrease in capital expenditures for 2020 compared to 2019 capital expenditures. In connection with the execution of the EQT Global GGA, management will reevaluate the Company's reporting units. In connection with the execution of the EQT Global GGA, management may be required to reevaluate the Company's reporting units under the provisions in ASC 350. If, as a result of this reevaluation, management identifies that a change to the current reporting units is warranted, management will assess the goodwill for impairment before and after the change in the reporting units.\nDepending on the location and timing of EQT's 2020 drilling activity, EQT's planned reductions in its drilling and completions activity, as well as reductions in drilling and completions activity by other producers, the Company may recognize additional goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges in future periods. The Company continues to receive and evaluate drilling plan information from EQT and other producers for 2020 and future years. As of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company cannot predict the likelihood or magnitude of any future impairment. See also \"Reviews of our goodwill and intangible and other long-lived assets have resulted in and could result in future significant impairment charges\" included in \"Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Related to EQM's Business\" and the Company's discussion on \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" under \"Outlook\" included in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\"\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nThe Company's liquidity requirements are to finance EQM's operations, EQM's capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions and capital contributions to joint ventures, including the MVP Joint Venture, pay cash dividends and distributions and satisfy any indebtedness obligations. The Company's ability to meet these liquidity requirements depends on the cash flow from operations (through EQM operations) and the Company's and EQM's ability to raise capital in banking, capital and other markets. The Company's available sources of liquidity include cash from operations (as distributed to the Company by EQM), incremental borrowings under revolving credit facilities, cash on hand and issuances of additional debt or equity securities by the Company or EQM. Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement (defined in Note 9), the Company is subject to certain restrictions related to certain corporate actions, including restrictions related to the issuance of the Company and EQM securities beyond certain thresholds as set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement for a two-year period following the Separation and Distribution. See \"We and EQM may determine to forgo or be required to forgo certain transactions in order to avoid the risk of incurring material tax-related liabilities or indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\" under \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Separation\" included in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" EQM is not forecasting any public equity issuance for currently anticipated organic growth projects.\nIn February 2020, S&P and Fitch downgraded EQM's credit ratings to non-investment grade and further downgraded the Company's credit ratings. As a result of the downgrades, each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch have assigned non-investment grade credit ratings to the Company and EQM. The non-investment grade ratings have caused EQM to incur higher borrowing costs under the EQM Credit Facility and 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement. In addition, as a result of the downgrades, EQM was obligated to deliver additional credit support to the MVP Joint Venture, which included letters of credit in the amounts of approximately $220.2 million and $14.2 million with respect to the MVP project and MVP Southgate project, respectively. See \"A further downgrade of EQM's credit ratings, including in connection with the MVP project or changes in the credit ratings of EQT, which are determined by independent third parties, could impact EQM's liquidity, access to capital, and costs of doing business.\" and \"The credit and risk profile of EQM affect our credit ratings and risk profile, and any adverse changes in EQM's credit and risk profile could increase our borrowing costs or hinder our ability to raise capital.\" under \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $976.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $721.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven primarily by the timing of payments from working capital.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash flows used in investing activities were $2,574.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1,786.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash used was primarily attributable to the cost of the Bolt-on Acquisition in 2019 and increased capital expenditures in 2019 relative to 2018 as further described in \"Capital Requirements,\" partly offset by decreased capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture consistent with the timing of construction for the MVP and MVP Southgate projects in 2019 relative to 2018.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities were $1,392.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1,237.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the primary sources of financing cash flows were borrowings on the Company's and EQM's credit facilities, proceeds from the issuance of the term loans under the 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement (defined in Note 11), which were used primarily to pay down borrowings under the EQM Credit Facility, and the net proceeds from the issuance of the Series A Preferred Units, which were used in part to fund the purchase price of the Bolt-on Acquisition and to pay certain fees and expenses related to the Bolt-on Acquisition, while the primary uses of financing cash flows were payments on the Company's and EQM's credit facility borrowings, the payment of dividends, the payments of distributions to noncontrolling interest unitholders, the Company's purchase of EQGP common units and the payment of distributions to Series A Preferred unitholders. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the primary sources of financing cash flows were proceeds from the issuance of the EQM $2.5 Billion Senior Notes and the Term Loans (defined in Note 11) and net credit facility borrowings, while the primary uses of financing cash flows were net distributions to EQT, distributions paid to noncontrolling interest unitholders, the EQGP Unit Purchases (defined in Note 7) and the Gulfport Transaction (defined in Note 1).\nCapital Requirements\nThe gathering, transmission and storage and water service businesses are capital intensive, requiring significant investment to develop new facilities and to maintain and upgrade existing operations.\n\n (a) Expansion capital expenditures do not include capital contributions made to the MVP Joint Venture of $774.6 million, $913.2 million and $159.6 million related to the MVP and MVP Southgate projects for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n (b) Includes approximately $22.5 million of expansion capital expenditures and $3.4 million of maintenance capital expenditures related to noncontrolling interests in Eureka Midstream for the year ended December 31, 2019. \n (c) The Company accrues capital expenditures when capital work has been completed but the associated bills have not been paid. Accrued capital expenditures are excluded from the statements of consolidated cash flows until they are paid. See Note 6. \nExpansion capital expenditures are expenditures incurred for capital improvements that the Company expects will increase its operating income or operating capacity over the long term. In 2019, expansion capital expenditures reflected investments in the assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition, the EQM-RMP Mergers and the Drop-Down Transaction, as well as the Hammerhead project and various wellhead gathering expansion projects, partly offset by decreased spending on the Equitrans, L.P. Expansion project. In 2018, expansion capital expenditures reflected primarily investments in the assets acquired in the EQM-RMP Mergers and the Drop-Down Transaction and in the following projects: the Hammerhead project, the Equitrans L.P. Expansion project, various wellhead gathering expansion projects and the Range Resources header pipeline project.\nMaintenance capital expenditures are expenditures made to maintain, over the long term, EQM's operating capacity or operating income. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures to repair, refurbish and replace pipelines, to connect new wells to maintain throughput, to maintain equipment reliability, integrity and safety and to address environmental laws and regulations. Maintenance capital expenditures increased by $13.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily as a result of maintenance associated with the assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition, additional assets placed in service and the timing of ongoing maintenance projects.\nIn connection with the Separation, the Company assumed all of EQT's obligations to indemnify and reimburse EQM under EQM's omnibus agreement with EQT other than for those losses or expenses relating to or arising from plugging and abandonment obligations. During 2019, the Company reimbursed EQM approximately $0.7 million associated with bare steel replacement capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's reimbursement obligations associated with bare steel replacement capital expenditures had been capped. Please read \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Agreements with EQT-Omnibus Agreement.\"\nIn 2020, EQM expects to make capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture of $650 million to $700 million depending on the timing of the construction of the MVP project and approximately $50 million for the MVP Southgate project. Expansion capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $525 million (exclusive of approximately $40 million attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Eureka Midstream) and maintenance capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $55 million (exclusive of approximately $5 million attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Eureka Midstream), net of expected reimbursements. Future capital investments may vary significantly from period to period based on the available investment opportunities and the timing of the construction of the MVP, MVP Southgate and other projects. Maintenance capital expenditures are also expected to vary quarter to quarter. EQM expects to fund future capital expenditures primarily through cash on hand, cash generated from operations, borrowings under its and its subsidiaries' respective credit facilities (including term loan agreements), debt transactions and issuances of additional EQM partnership units. EQM is not forecasting any public equity issuance for currently anticipated organic growth projects.\nCredit Facilities\nSee Note 11 for discussion of the Company's and its subsidiaries' credit facilities. See Note 18 for additional information on the proposed Intercompany Loan and the anticipated termination of the ETRN Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nSecurity Ratings\nThe table below sets forth the credit ratings for debt instruments of the Company and EQM at December 31, 2019.\n\nOn January 31, 2020, Moody's affirmed the Company's Ba3 and EQM's Ba1 credit ratings but changed its outlook from stable to negative, citing uncertainty around the MVP project and EQT's weakening credit profile. On February 4, 2020, S&P downgraded the Company's credit rating to a BB- rating, with a negative outlook, from a BB rating. S&P also downgraded EQM's credit to a BB+ rating, with a negative outlook, from a BBB- rating. On February 27, 2020, S&P further downgraded EQM's credit to a BB rating, with a stable outlook, but upgraded the Company's credit rating to BB, with a stable outlook. Further, on February 18, 2020, Fitch downgraded EQM to a BB rating, with a negative outlook, from a BBB- rating, citing a downgrade of EQT's credit rating from BBB- to BB, with a negative outlook, on February 14, 2020, as well as uncertainty around the MVP project, as the principal reasons for the ratings action. Additionally, on February 18, 2020, Fitch downgraded the Company's credit rating from BB to B+ with a negative outlook credit rating and the credit rating specific to the Company's\nterm loan B from BB to B with a negative outlook. The Company's and EQM's credit ratings are subject to further revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The Company and EQM cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant, including in connection with the MVP project or the creditworthiness of EQM's customers, including EQT. As of December 31, 2019, EQT's public debt had an investment grade rating, but was on negative outlook with Moody's, S&P and Fitch. On January 13, 2020, Moody's downgraded EQT's senior unsecured rating to Ba1 with a negative outlook, from Baa3 with a negative outlook. On February 3, 2020, S&P downgraded EQT's senior unsecured rating to BB+ with a negative outlook, from BBB- with a negative outlook. Further, on February 14, 2020, Fitch downgraded EQT's senior unsecured rating to BB with a negative outlook, from BBB-. If any credit rating agency further downgrades the Company's or EQM's ratings, the Company's and EQM's access to the capital markets may be limited, borrowing costs could increase, EQM may be required to provide additional credit assurances in support of commercial agreements such as joint venture agreements and, if applicable, construction contracts, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease. In order to be considered investment grade, a company must be rated Baa3 or higher by Moody's, BBB- or higher by S&P, or BBB- or higher by Fitch. Anything below these ratings, including all of the Company's and EQM's credit ratings are considered non-investment grade.\nSchedule of Contractual Obligations\nThe following represents the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019. Purchase obligations exclude future capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture and purchase obligations of the MVP Joint Venture. In addition, the following contractual obligations exclude distributions associated with the Series A Preferred Units.\n\n (a) Includes $3.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of EQM's senior notes and $1.4 billion associated with the term loans issued pursuant to the 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2019. See Note 11 for further information. \n (b) Credit facility borrowings were classified based on the termination date of the credit facility agreements. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had aggregate credit facility borrowings outstanding of approximately $610 million and $293 million under the EQM Credit Facility and the Eureka Credit Facility, respectively. See Note 11 for further information. \n (c) Interest payments exclude interest related to the EQM Credit Facility, Eureka Credit Facility and term loans issued under the 2019 EQM Term Loan and ETRN Term Loan as the interest rates on the credit facility borrowings and the term loans are variable. \n (d) Purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms, including the approximate timing of the transaction. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's purchase obligations included commitments for capital expenditures, operating expenses and service contracts. \n (e) Operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings, as well as lease obligations for compression equipment under existing contracts with third parties. \n (f) Other liabilities represent commitments for estimated payouts as of December 31, 2019 for various Equitrans Midstream liability award plans. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" below and Note 10 for discussion of factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations. \nSee Note 18 for additional information on the proposed Intercompany Loan and the anticipated termination of the ETRN Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company and its subsidiaries, including EQM. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the Company and EQM are unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. The Company and EQM accrue legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when incurred. Each of the Company and EQM, as applicable, establishes reserves whenever it believes it to be appropriate for pending matters. Furthermore, after consultation with counsel and considering available insurance, the Company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against it, EQM or any of their respective subsidiaries will not materially affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.\nSee \"The regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is challenging, and recent decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending proceedings could impact EQM's or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the projected time frame or at all or EQM's ability to achieve the expected investment return on the projects.\" under \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to EQM's Business\" included in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" and see \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" for discussion of litigation and regulatory proceedings related to the MVP project.\nSee Note 14 for further discussion of the Company's commitments and contingencies.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSee Note 8 for discussion of the MVP Joint Venture guarantees.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRecently issued accounting standards relevant to the Company are described in Note 1.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The following critical accounting policies, which were reviewed by the Company's Audit Committee, relate to its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nIncome Taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements or tax returns.\nThe Company has federal and state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards related to federal and various state jurisdictions. The federal and states of Virginia and West Virginia NOL carryforwards have no expiration, but utilization is limited to 80% of taxable income in the year of utilization. The Company's Pennsylvania NOL carryforwards expire in 2039. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain federal and state NOL carryforwards will be realized. In addition to the NOL carryforwards, the Company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from its investments in partnerships. No valuation allowances have been established because the Company believes that future sources of taxable income, reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets. Any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the Company's income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made.\nValuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carry-back periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carry-forward period, including from tax planning strategies, and experience. The Company has not noted any significant negative evidence.\nDeferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized, and changes in facts and circumstances may result in the establishment of a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence that apply to valuation allowance establishment. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset for which a valuation is recorded will be realized, all or a portion of the valuation allowance may be released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates from law changes.\nTax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold; otherwise, the tax benefit is recorded when the tax position has been effectively settled, either because the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed its examination. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.\nThe Company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are \"critical accounting estimates\" because the Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, exercise judgment when evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions. To the extent that a valuation allowance or an uncertain tax position is established or increased or decreased during a period, the Company includes an expense or benefit within income tax expense on the statements of comprehensive income. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions. See Note 12 for additional information.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. Determination of depreciation requires judgment regarding the estimated useful lives and salvage values of property, plant and equipment. The Company has not historically experienced material changes in its results of operations from changes in the estimated useful lives or salvage values of its property, plant and equipment; however, these estimates are reviewed periodically, including each time Equitrans, L.P. files with the FERC for a change in its transmission, storage and gathering rates. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to depreciation is a \"critical accounting estimate\" because it is susceptible to change. These assumptions affect depreciation expense and, if changed, would have an effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 for additional information.\nImpairments of Long-Lived Assets, Including Intangible Assets and Goodwill. Any accounting estimate related to impairment of property, plant and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets, goodwill or an investment in an unconsolidated entity may require the Company's management to make assumptions about future cash flows, discount rates, the fair value of investments and whether losses in the value of its investments are other than temporary. Management's assumptions about future cash flows require significant judgment because actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future.\nGoodwill is the cost of an acquisition less the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company uses a combination of an income and market approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. See Notes 1 and 3 for additional information.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to impairments are \"critical accounting estimates\" because they require assumptions that are susceptible to change, including estimating fair value which requires considerable judgment. For goodwill, management's estimate of a reporting unit's future financial results is sensitive to changes in assumptions, such as changes in stock prices, weighted-average cost of capital, terminal growth rates and industry multiples. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions used in estimating its reporting units' fair values are reasonable and appropriate, however, different assumptions and estimates could materially affect the calculated fair value and the resulting conclusion on impairment of goodwill, which could materially affect the Company's results of operations and financial position. Additionally, actual results could differ from these estimates. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis for the RMP PA Gas Gathering reporting unit (defined and discussed in Note 1), which is the only reporting unit with goodwill as of December 31, 2019, to quantify the effect of certain changes to assumptions used in the goodwill assessment. It was determined that a 1% increase to the weighted average cost of capital and a corresponding 1% decrease to the terminal cash flow growth rate would have resulted in the Company's recognition of approximately $81.3 million of additional impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2019.\nThe Company's investments in unconsolidated entities also require considerable judgment to estimate fair value because the Company's investments are not traded on an active market. Additionally, investments in unconsolidated entities are susceptible to impairment risk from further adverse macroeconomic conditions or other adverse factors such as permit and litigation matters impacting the MVP project. Such matters could cause further significant delays in the timing and costs of the MVP project which could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges relating to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities.\nAny potential impairment would have an effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position. See Notes 1 and 3 for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue from the gathering, transmission and storage of natural gas is generally recognized when the service is provided. Revenue from water services is generally recognized when water is delivered. For all contracts, EQM allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the judgmentally determined relative standalone selling price. When applicable, the excess of consideration received over revenue recognized results in the deferral of those amounts until future periods based on a units of production or straight-line methodology as these methods appropriately match the consumption of services provided to the customer. The units of production methodology requires the use of production estimates that are uncertain and the use of judgment when developing estimates of future production volumes, thus impacting the rate of revenue recognition. Production estimates are monitored as circumstances and events warrant. Certain of our gas gathering and water agreements have MVCs. If a customer under such an agreement fails to meet its MVC for a specified period (thus not exercising all the contractual rights to gathering and water services within the specified period, herein referred to as breakage\u201d), it is obligated to pay a contractually determined fee based upon the shortfall between the actual gathered or water volumes and the MVC for the period contained in the contract. Based on management's judgment, it is probable that the customer will not exercise all or a portion of its remaining rights, we recognize revenue associated with such breakage amount in proportion to the pattern of exercised rights within the respective MVC period.\nRevenue related to services provided but not yet billed is estimated each month. These estimates are generally based on contract data, preliminary throughput and allocation measurements. Final bills for the current month are billed and collected in the following month. See Note 4 for additional information.\nEQM records a provision for accounts receivable that are estimated to be uncollectible. In order to calculate the appropriate provision, an estimated loss rate of accounts receivable as a percentage of total revenue is used. This estimated loss rate is applied to the outstanding accounts receivable and is updated periodically based on a customer's credit rating or other events that could impact the estimated loss rate, such as a significant change to the natural gas industry or to the economy as a whole. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis using the assumptions that apply at that time. While EQM has not historically experienced material bad debt expense, declines in the market price for natural gas affecting producer activity combined with the increase in customers on EQM's systems may result in a greater exposure to potential losses than management's current estimates.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to revenue recognition are \"critical accounting estimates\" because estimated volumes are subject to change based on actual measurements, including prior period adjustments. In addition, the Company believes that the accounting estimates related to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable are \"critical accounting estimates\" because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change and the actual mix of customers and their ability to pay may vary significantly from management's estimates, which could affect the collectability of customer accounts. These accounting estimates could potentially have a material effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.\nBusiness Combinations. During the second quarter of 2019, EQM recorded the Bolt-on Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting; accordingly, the values assigned to the assets and liabilities are based on EQM's purchase price accounting estimates. Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires a company to record the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities at fair value. The estimated fair value of midstream facilities and equipment, which generally consist of pipeline systems and compression stations, was estimated using the cost approach. Significant unobservable inputs in the estimate of fair value include management's assumptions about the replacement costs for similar assets, the relative age of the acquired assets and any potential economic or functional obsolescence associated with the acquired assets. The fair value of intangible assets was determined using the income approach, which requires a forecast of the expected future cash flows generated and an estimated market-based weighted average cost of capital. Significant unobservable inputs in the determination of fair value include future revenue estimates, future cost assumptions and estimated customer retention rates.\nGiven the time required to obtain pertinent information necessary to finalize the allocation of the purchase price to the acquired net assets, the purchase price allocation remained preliminary for a period of time before the required fair value estimates were finalized. It is not uncommon for the", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company has applied the FAST Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K that was adopted by the SEC on March 20, 2019, which allows registrants providing financial statements covering three years in a filing to exclude discussion of the earliest of the three years in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\". The information covered here provides a comparison of material changes in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018. For the comparison of fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017, see Part II, \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 14, 2019.\nExecutive Overview\nNet loss attributable to Equitrans Midstream was $203.7 million in 2019 compared with net income attributable to Equitrans Midstream of $218.4 million in 2018. The decrease resulted primarily from increased impairments to long-lived assets (as discussed in Note 3), higher net interest expense associated with increased long-term debt outstanding, higher other operating expenses and lower net income attributable to noncontrolling interests partly offset by higher gathering revenues primarily associated with the operating entities acquired with the Bolt-on Acquisition, higher equity income from EQM's investment in the MVP Joint Venture and lower income tax expense.\nOn January 15, 2020, the Board declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2019 of $0.45 per share payable on February 21, 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 11, 2020.\nThe following table reconciles the differences between operating income attributable to EQM as reported in EQM's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and operating income attributable to Equitrans Midstream for the same periods.\nTable 255: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income attributable to EQM\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>204,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>726,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Separation and other transaction costs\n</td> <td>6,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of long-lived assets\n</td> <td>114,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additional expenses, net\n</td> <td>6,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income attributable to Equitrans Midstream\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>643,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSeparation and Other Transaction Costs. Separation and other transaction costs primarily represented expenses related to the EQGP Buyout, the EQM IDR Transaction and the Separation for the year ended December 31, 2019. Separation and other transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily related to the Rice Merger, the EQM-RMP Mergers, the Drop-Down Transaction, the Separation, the EQGP Buyout and the EQM IDR Transaction (which included charges from EQT). Separation costs recorded in 2018 also included a one-time charitable contribution of $15.0 million made to the Equitrans Midstream Foundation, a charitable organization established to continue EQT's legacy of charitable giving. Future contributions to the Equitrans Midstream Foundation, if any, will be evaluated from time to time.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets. The Company recognized $115.0 million of additional goodwill impairment primarily related to the Rice Retained Midstream reporting unit (see Note 3).\nAdditional Expenses, Net. As a result of being a publicly traded company, the Company incurs additional operating expenses separate from and in addition to similar costs incurred by EQM.\nBusiness Segment Results\nOperating segments are revenue-producing components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is produced internally and is subject to evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources. Other income, net interest expense and income tax expense are managed on a consolidated basis. The Company has presented each segment's operating income, equity income and various operational measures in the following sections. Management believes that the presentation of this information is useful to management and investors regarding the financial condition, results of operations and trends of its segments. The Company has reconciled each segment's operating income to the Company's consolidated operating income and net income in Note 6.\nGATHERING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table 256: <table><tr><td> </td>

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nGathering operating revenues increased by $162.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018, driven primarily as a result of revenues generated by the entities acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition, as well as production development in the Marcellus and Utica Shales in 2019. Firm reservation fee revenues increased approximately $133.8 million primarily as a result of increased revenues generated under agreements with MVCs and revenues generated by the entities acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition, as well as higher rates on various wellhead expansion projects in 2019. Volumetric-based fee revenues increased approximately $29.1 million due to revenues generated by the entities acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition.\nGathering operating expenses increased by $675.1 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily as a result of approximately $854.3 million in impairment charges in 2019, of which $736.8 million related to impairments of goodwill, $81.0 million was associated with an impairment to certain low-pressure gathering assets and $36.4 million related to an impairment of intangible\nassets (as discussed in Note 3), an approximate $45.6 million increase in depreciation expense as a result of additional assets placed in-service, as well as depreciation on assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition and the Shared Assets Transaction, and an approximate $17.0 million increase in operating and maintenance expense primarily associated with the operations of entities acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition and increased personnel costs, partly offset by a decrease to repairs and maintenance expense. In addition, EQM recognized an increase to separation and other transaction costs of approximately $11.6 million primarily associated with the Bolt-on Acquisition. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $3.2 million primarily due to lower corporate overhead and personnel costs, partly offset by an increase in information technology related expenses and an increase in expenses associated with the entities acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition.\nSee \"Outlook\" and Note 3 for further discussion of the impairment of long-lived assets.\nSee also Outlook\u201d and Note 18 for a discussion of the EQT Global GGA with EQT and the Credit Letter Agreement, and the transactions related thereto, including the potential cash fee relief related to the MVP in-service date. The Company expects that the revenues resulting from the MVCs provided in the EQT Global GGA will increase the proportion of the Company's total operating revenues that are firm reservation fee revenues in future periods.\nTRANSMISSION RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table 259: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nTransmission operating revenues increased by approximately $3.7 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increased volumetric-based fee revenues due to an increase in pipeline throughput.\nTransmission operating expenses decreased by approximately $8.4 million in 2019 compared to 2018. Operating and maintenance expense decreased approximately $5.6 million primarily resulting from lower personnel costs and a decrease in repairs and maintenance expense. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased approximately $5.1 million resulting from lower corporate overhead and personnel costs. The decrease in operating and maintenance expense and selling, general and administrative expense was partly offset by an increase in depreciation expense due to additional assets placed in service.\nEquity income increased by $101.5 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the increase in the MVP Joint Venture's AFUDC on the MVP as a result of continued spending on the project.\nWATER RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table 261: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FINANCIAL DATA\n</td> <td>(Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water service revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>717.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating and maintenance\n</td> <td>34,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>688.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>2,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,598.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>26,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>568.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>64,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>677.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>808.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPERATIONAL DATA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water services volumes (MMgal)\n</td> <td>1,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>823.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Includes the pre-acquisition results of the EQM-RMP Mergers, which were effective July 23, 2018. The recast is for the period the acquired businesses were under the common control of EQT, which began on November 13, 2017 as a result of the Rice Merger.  Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nWater operating revenues decreased by $31.4 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to a reduction in fresh water distribution fees as the fee EQM charges per gallon of water is tiered and thus is lower on a per gallon basis once certain volumetric thresholds are met and a 13.4% decrease in fresh water distribution volumes associated with lower customer activity.\nWater operating expenses decreased by $9.1 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily as a result of decreased operating and maintenance expense associated with reduced operating activity and water procurement costs and decreased selling, general and administrative expense associated with lower corporate overhead and personnel costs, partly offset by increased depreciation expense as a result of additional assets placed in-service.\nOther Income Statement Items\nOther Income\nOther income decreased $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the net settlement of incentive compensation.\nNet Interest Expense\nNet interest expense increased by $140.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due primarily to higher interest expense of $64.8 million on the EQM $2.5 Billion Senior Notes (defined in Note 11), higher interest expense of $58.2 million associated with increased outstanding debt related to the ETRN Term Loan Credit Agreement (defined in Note 11) and the 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement (defined in Note 11), higher interest expense of $18.6 million on net credit facility borrowings (including borrowings under the Eureka Credit Facility (defined in Note 11)), a decrease in interest income earned on cash on hand of $12.1 million and higher amortization of debt issuance costs of $6.9 million, partly offset by increased capitalized interest and AFUDC - debt of $18.0 million.\nSee Notes 11 and 18 for discussion of the Company's, EQM's and Eureka Midstream's debt, as applicable.\nIncome Taxes\nSee Note 12 for an explanation of the decrease in income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe Company's operations had been included in EQT's consolidated income tax return for federal and state tax purposes prior to the Separation. As a result, the financial statements include the income taxes incurred by the Company computed on a separate return basis. EQM, Eureka Midstream and EQGP are limited partnerships for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes and are not subject to U.S. federal or state income taxes. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, Rice Midstream Holdings LLC (Rice Midstream Holdings) was a multi-member LLC and was not subject to U.S. federal or state income taxes. In the fourth quarter of 2018, prior to the Separation, Rice Midstream Holdings was merged out of existence as part of internal restructurings.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Reform Legislation), which made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law, including lowering the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% beginning January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Legislation contains several other provisions, such as limiting the utilization of net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017 that are carried into future years to 80% of taxable income and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense, which are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's results of operations. As of December 31, 2018, the Company completed its accounting for the effects of the Tax Reform Legislation, including accounting for the revaluation of net deferred tax assets and for state income tax effects, and recorded deferred income tax expense of $7.4 million, which is in addition to the $129.3 million of deferred income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company also considered whether existing deferred tax assets will be recovered in future periods under this legislation and noted no significant effect on the deferred tax assets.\nAll of EQM, Eureka Midstream and, for the period prior to the EQGP Buyout, EQGP income is included in the Company's pre-tax income; however, the Company does not record income tax expense on the portions of its income attributable to the noncontrolling limited partners of EQM, the noncontrolling members of Eureka Midstream, the noncontrolling limited partners of EQGP (for the period prior to the EQGP Buyout) and, for the period prior to May 1, 2018, the noncontrolling member of Strike Force Midstream. This reduces the Company's effective tax rate in periods when the Company has consolidated pre-tax income. Also, given that Rice Midstream Holdings was a multi-member limited liability company prior to October 22, 2018, the Company was not required to record income tax expense on Rice Midstream Holdings' income during such prior periods.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's noncontrolling interests included the third-party ownership interests in EQM. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and specifically for the period from April 10, 2019 to December 31, 2019, the Company's noncontrolling interests also included third-party ownership interests in Eureka Midstream, as well as the Series A Preferred Unit interests in EQM's net income. For the period beginning January 1, 2019 and ending January 10, 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company's noncontrolling interests included third-party ownership interests in EQGP. For the periods in 2018 prior to the Company's acquisition of their remaining respective noncontrolling interests, the Company's noncontrolling interests also included the third-party ownership interests in RMP and Gulfport Midstream's 25% ownership interest in Strike Force Midstream.\nThe noncontrolling interests described above resulted in net income allocations to noncontrolling interests in the statements of consolidated comprehensive income. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests fluctuates based on the amount of net income earned by the entities with noncontrolling interests, the amount of net income allocated to EQM's IDRs prior to the EQM IDR Transaction, the amount of net income allocated to the Class B units subsequent to the EQM IDR Transaction, the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest related to the third-party ownership interests in Eureka\nMidstream, the amount of net income attributable to the Series A Preferred Units and any changes in the noncontrolling ownership percentages.\nSee \"Investing Activities\" and \"Capital Requirements\" under \"Capital Resources and Liquidity\" for discussion of capital expenditures.\nOutlook\nThe Company's assets overlay core acreage in the Appalachian Basin. The location of the Company's assets allows it to access major demand markets in the U.S. The Company is one of the largest natural gas gatherers in the U.S., and its largest customer, EQT, is the largest natural gas producer in the U.S. based on produced volumes. The Company maintains a stable cash flow profile, with approximately 58% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 generated by firm reservation fees and MVCs. Further, the percentage of the Company's revenues that are generated by firm reservation fees and MVCs is expected to increase in future years as a result of the EQT Global GGA, which includes an MVC effective on February 26, 2020 of 3.0 Bcf per day, which ramps up to 4.0 Bcf per day in future periods following the in-service date of the MVP project.\nThe Company's principal strategy is to achieve the scale and scope of a top-tier midstream company by leveraging its existing assets, executing on its growth projects and, where appropriate, seeking and executing on strategically-aligned acquisition and joint venture opportunities, while strengthening its balance sheet through (i) highly predictable cash flows backed by MVCs and firm reservation fees, (ii) actions to delever its balance sheet, (iii) disciplined capital spending, (iv) operating cost control and (v) an appropriate distribution policy. As part of its approach to organic growth, the Company is focused on building and completing its key transmission and gathering growth projects outlined under \"Strategy\" in \"Item 1. Business,\" many of which are supported by contracts with firm capacity commitments. Additionally, the Company is targeting growth from volumetric gathering and transmission opportunities and from its water services business, which is complementary to its gathering business.\nOn February 27, 2020, the Company and EQM announced the EQT Global GGA with EQT, which is a 15-year contract that includes, among other things, a 3.0 Bcf per day MVC (which gradually steps up to 4.0 Bcf per day for several years following the in-service date of the MVP project) and the dedication of a substantial majority of EQT's core acreage in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to the Company, and EQT received certain gathering fee relief over a period of three years following the in-service date of the MVP. The EQT Global GGA replaced 14 previous gathering agreements between affiliates of EQT and the Company. In addition, on February 27, 2020, the Company and EQM announced a definitive merger agreement between the Company, EQM and certain of their affiliates related to the EQM Merger, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company will acquire all of the issued and outstanding EQM common units (other than EQM common units held by the Company and its subsidiaries). Following the EQM Merger, which is subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals of EQM's limited partners and the Company's shareholders, EQM will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and will no longer be a public entity. The Company expects the EQM Merger to close in mid-2020. See Note 18 for additional information regarding the EQT Global GGA, the EQM Merger and the transactions related thereto.\nFor further discussion of key growth projects, see \"Strategy\" in \"Item 1. Business.\" For further discussion of capital expenditures, see \"Capital Requirements.\"\nCommodity Prices. The Company's business is dependent on continued natural gas production and the availability and development of reserves in its areas of operation. Low prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids have adversely affected development of additional reserves and production that is accessible by EQM's pipeline and storage assets, which also negatively affects EQM's water services business. The Henry Hub natural gas price ranged from $2.02 per MMbtu to $4.25 per MMbtu between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019, and the natural gas forward strip price trended downwards during 2019 and in early 2020, and is expected to remain depressed for several years. Further, market prices for natural gas in the Appalachian Basin continue to be lower than Henry Hub natural gas prices. Lower natural gas prices have caused producers to determine to reduce their rig count or otherwise take actions to slow production growth and/or reduce production, which in turn reduces the demand for, and usage of, EQM's services. A sustained period of depressed natural gas production and prices could cause producers in EQM's areas of operation to take further actions to reduce natural gas production and supply in the future. EQM's customers, including EQT, have announced reductions in their capital spending and may continue to lower capital spending in the future based on commodity prices, access to capital, investor expectations for positive free cash flow, a desire to reduce leverage or other factors. On January 13, 2020, EQT publicly announced a 2020 capital expenditure forecast of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion, compared to 2019 capital expenditures of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion, which represents an approximate 30% decrease in capital expenditures compared to EQT's projected 2019 capital expenditures. Longer-term price declines could continue to have an adverse effect on customers' creditworthiness and related ability to pay firm reservation fees under long-term contracts and/or affect activity levels and, accordingly, volumetric-based fees which could affect the\nCompany's results of operations, liquidity or financial position. For example, on February 3, 2020, S&P took negative rating actions on nine Appalachian exploration and production companies citing lower natural gas price assumptions. Many of EQM's customers, including EQT, have entered into long-term firm reservation transmission and gathering contracts or contracts with MVCs on EQM's systems. However, approximately 49.9% of EQM's gathering revenues and 8.7% of EQM's transmission revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were from volumetric-based fee revenues. Additionally, EQM's water service agreements are primarily volumetric in nature. For more information see \"Decreases in production of natural gas in EQM's areas of operation have adversely affected, and future decreases could further adversely affect, its business and operating results and reduce its cash available to make distributions to its unitholders, including us\" included in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to EQM's Business.\"\nPotential Future Impairments. During 2019, the Company recognized an impairment to goodwill of approximately $851.8 million, including $602.1 million, $150.5 million, and $99.2 million associated with its RMP PA Gas Gathering, Rice Retained Midstream and Eureka/Hornet reporting units, respectively. In addition, the Company recognized a $36.4 million impairment related to certain Hornet Midstream-related intangible assets during the third quarter of 2019. See Note 3 for additional information. On January 13, 2020, EQT publicly announced an approximately 30% decrease in capital expenditures for 2020 compared to 2019 capital expenditures. In connection with the execution of the EQT Global GGA, management will reevaluate the Company's reporting units. In connection with the execution of the EQT Global GGA, management may be required to reevaluate the Company's reporting units under the provisions in ASC 350. If, as a result of this reevaluation, management identifies that a change to the current reporting units is warranted, management will assess the goodwill for impairment before and after the change in the reporting units.\nDepending on the location and timing of EQT's 2020 drilling activity, EQT's planned reductions in its drilling and completions activity, as well as reductions in drilling and completions activity by other producers, the Company may recognize additional goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges in future periods. The Company continues to receive and evaluate drilling plan information from EQT and other producers for 2020 and future years. As of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company cannot predict the likelihood or magnitude of any future impairment. See also \"Reviews of our goodwill and intangible and other long-lived assets have resulted in and could result in future significant impairment charges\" included in \"Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Related to EQM's Business\" and the Company's discussion on \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" under \"Outlook\" included in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\"\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nThe Company's liquidity requirements are to finance EQM's operations, EQM's capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions and capital contributions to joint ventures, including the MVP Joint Venture, pay cash dividends and distributions and satisfy any indebtedness obligations. The Company's ability to meet these liquidity requirements depends on the cash flow from operations (through EQM operations) and the Company's and EQM's ability to raise capital in banking, capital and other markets. The Company's available sources of liquidity include cash from operations (as distributed to the Company by EQM), incremental borrowings under revolving credit facilities, cash on hand and issuances of additional debt or equity securities by the Company or EQM. Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement (defined in Note 9), the Company is subject to certain restrictions related to certain corporate actions, including restrictions related to the issuance of the Company and EQM securities beyond certain thresholds as set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement for a two-year period following the Separation and Distribution. See \"We and EQM may determine to forgo or be required to forgo certain transactions in order to avoid the risk of incurring material tax-related liabilities or indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\" under \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Separation\" included in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" EQM is not forecasting any public equity issuance for currently anticipated organic growth projects.\nIn February 2020, S&P and Fitch downgraded EQM's credit ratings to non-investment grade and further downgraded the Company's credit ratings. As a result of the downgrades, each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch have assigned non-investment grade credit ratings to the Company and EQM. The non-investment grade ratings have caused EQM to incur higher borrowing costs under the EQM Credit Facility and 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement. In addition, as a result of the downgrades, EQM was obligated to deliver additional credit support to the MVP Joint Venture, which included letters of credit in the amounts of approximately $220.2 million and $14.2 million with respect to the MVP project and MVP Southgate project, respectively. See \"A further downgrade of EQM's credit ratings, including in connection with the MVP project or changes in the credit ratings of EQT, which are determined by independent third parties, could impact EQM's liquidity, access to capital, and costs of doing business.\" and \"The credit and risk profile of EQM affect our credit ratings and risk profile, and any adverse changes in EQM's credit and risk profile could increase our borrowing costs or hinder our ability to raise capital.\" under \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $976.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $721.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven primarily by the timing of payments from working capital.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash flows used in investing activities were $2,574.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1,786.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash used was primarily attributable to the cost of the Bolt-on Acquisition in 2019 and increased capital expenditures in 2019 relative to 2018 as further described in \"Capital Requirements,\" partly offset by decreased capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture consistent with the timing of construction for the MVP and MVP Southgate projects in 2019 relative to 2018.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities were $1,392.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1,237.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the primary sources of financing cash flows were borrowings on the Company's and EQM's credit facilities, proceeds from the issuance of the term loans under the 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement (defined in Note 11), which were used primarily to pay down borrowings under the EQM Credit Facility, and the net proceeds from the issuance of the Series A Preferred Units, which were used in part to fund the purchase price of the Bolt-on Acquisition and to pay certain fees and expenses related to the Bolt-on Acquisition, while the primary uses of financing cash flows were payments on the Company's and EQM's credit facility borrowings, the payment of dividends, the payments of distributions to noncontrolling interest unitholders, the Company's purchase of EQGP common units and the payment of distributions to Series A Preferred unitholders. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the primary sources of financing cash flows were proceeds from the issuance of the EQM $2.5 Billion Senior Notes and the Term Loans (defined in Note 11) and net credit facility borrowings, while the primary uses of financing cash flows were net distributions to EQT, distributions paid to noncontrolling interest unitholders, the EQGP Unit Purchases (defined in Note 7) and the Gulfport Transaction (defined in Note 1).\nCapital Requirements\nThe gathering, transmission and storage and water service businesses are capital intensive, requiring significant investment to develop new facilities and to maintain and upgrade existing operations.\nTable 263: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expansion capital expenditures (a)(b)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>866,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>803,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>328,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital expenditures\n</td> <td>65,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Headquarters capital expenditures\n</td> <td>9,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures (b)\n</td> <td>941,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>884,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>371,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: accrued capital expenditures at the end of prior period (c)\n</td> <td>109,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: accrued capital expenditures at acquisition on April 10, 2019 (c)\n</td> <td>8,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: accrued capital expenditures at acquisition on November 13, 2017 (c)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: accrued capital expenditures at the end of current period (c)\n</td> <td>(91,998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(109,347\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90,655\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>967,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>865,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>380,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Expansion capital expenditures do not include capital contributions made to the MVP Joint Venture of $774.6 million, $913.2 million and $159.6 million related to the MVP and MVP Southgate projects for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n (b) Includes approximately $22.5 million of expansion capital expenditures and $3.4 million of maintenance capital expenditures related to noncontrolling interests in Eureka Midstream for the year ended December 31, 2019. \n (c) The Company accrues capital expenditures when capital work has been completed but the associated bills have not been paid. Accrued capital expenditures are excluded from the statements of consolidated cash flows until they are paid. See Note 6. \nExpansion capital expenditures are expenditures incurred for capital improvements that the Company expects will increase its operating income or operating capacity over the long term. In 2019, expansion capital expenditures reflected investments in the assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition, the EQM-RMP Mergers and the Drop-Down Transaction, as well as the Hammerhead project and various wellhead gathering expansion projects, partly offset by decreased spending on the Equitrans, L.P. Expansion project. In 2018, expansion capital expenditures reflected primarily investments in the assets acquired in the EQM-RMP Mergers and the Drop-Down Transaction and in the following projects: the Hammerhead project, the Equitrans L.P. Expansion project, various wellhead gathering expansion projects and the Range Resources header pipeline project.\nMaintenance capital expenditures are expenditures made to maintain, over the long term, EQM's operating capacity or operating income. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures to repair, refurbish and replace pipelines, to connect new wells to maintain throughput, to maintain equipment reliability, integrity and safety and to address environmental laws and regulations. Maintenance capital expenditures increased by $13.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily as a result of maintenance associated with the assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition, additional assets placed in service and the timing of ongoing maintenance projects.\nIn connection with the Separation, the Company assumed all of EQT's obligations to indemnify and reimburse EQM under EQM's omnibus agreement with EQT other than for those losses or expenses relating to or arising from plugging and abandonment obligations. During 2019, the Company reimbursed EQM approximately $0.7 million associated with bare steel replacement capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's reimbursement obligations associated with bare steel replacement capital expenditures had been capped. Please read \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Agreements with EQT-Omnibus Agreement.\"\nIn 2020, EQM expects to make capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture of $650 million to $700 million depending on the timing of the construction of the MVP project and approximately $50 million for the MVP Southgate project. Expansion capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $525 million (exclusive of approximately $40 million attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Eureka Midstream) and maintenance capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $55 million (exclusive of approximately $5 million attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Eureka Midstream), net of expected reimbursements. Future capital investments may vary significantly from period to period based on the available investment opportunities and the timing of the construction of the MVP, MVP Southgate and other projects. Maintenance capital expenditures are also expected to vary quarter to quarter. EQM expects to fund future capital expenditures primarily through cash on hand, cash generated from operations, borrowings under its and its subsidiaries' respective credit facilities (including term loan agreements), debt transactions and issuances of additional EQM partnership units. EQM is not forecasting any public equity issuance for currently anticipated organic growth projects.\nCredit Facilities\nSee Note 11 for discussion of the Company's and its subsidiaries' credit facilities. See Note 18 for additional information on the proposed Intercompany Loan and the anticipated termination of the ETRN Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nSecurity Ratings\nThe table below sets forth the credit ratings for debt instruments of the Company and EQM at December 31, 2019.\nTable 267: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Equitrans Midstream\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>EQM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Term Loan B\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Senior Notes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating Service\n</td> <td>Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outlook\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's\n</td> <td>Ba3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ba1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P\n</td> <td>BB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Negative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Negative\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch\n</td> <td>BB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Negative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Negative\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn January 31, 2020, Moody's affirmed the Company's Ba3 and EQM's Ba1 credit ratings but changed its outlook from stable to negative, citing uncertainty around the MVP project and EQT's weakening credit profile. On February 4, 2020, S&P downgraded the Company's credit rating to a BB- rating, with a negative outlook, from a BB rating. S&P also downgraded EQM's credit to a BB+ rating, with a negative outlook, from a BBB- rating. On February 27, 2020, S&P further downgraded EQM's credit to a BB rating, with a stable outlook, but upgraded the Company's credit rating to BB, with a stable outlook. Further, on February 18, 2020, Fitch downgraded EQM to a BB rating, with a negative outlook, from a BBB- rating, citing a downgrade of EQT's credit rating from BBB- to BB, with a negative outlook, on February 14, 2020, as well as uncertainty around the MVP project, as the principal reasons for the ratings action. Additionally, on February 18, 2020, Fitch downgraded the Company's credit rating from BB to B+ with a negative outlook credit rating and the credit rating specific to the Company's\nterm loan B from BB to B with a negative outlook. The Company's and EQM's credit ratings are subject to further revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The Company and EQM cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant, including in connection with the MVP project or the creditworthiness of EQM's customers, including EQT. As of December 31, 2019, EQT's public debt had an investment grade rating, but was on negative outlook with Moody's, S&P and Fitch. On January 13, 2020, Moody's downgraded EQT's senior unsecured rating to Ba1 with a negative outlook, from Baa3 with a negative outlook. On February 3, 2020, S&P downgraded EQT's senior unsecured rating to BB+ with a negative outlook, from BBB- with a negative outlook. Further, on February 14, 2020, Fitch downgraded EQT's senior unsecured rating to BB with a negative outlook, from BBB-. If any credit rating agency further downgrades the Company's or EQM's ratings, the Company's and EQM's access to the capital markets may be limited, borrowing costs could increase, EQM may be required to provide additional credit assurances in support of commercial agreements such as joint venture agreements and, if applicable, construction contracts, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease. In order to be considered investment grade, a company must be rated Baa3 or higher by Moody's, BBB- or higher by S&P, or BBB- or higher by Fitch. Anything below these ratings, including all of the Company's and EQM's credit ratings are considered non-investment grade.\nSchedule of Contractual Obligations\nThe following represents the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019. Purchase obligations exclude future capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture and purchase obligations of the MVP Joint Venture.

See Note 11 for further information. \n (b) Credit facility borrowings were classified based on the termination date of the credit facility agreements. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had aggregate credit facility borrowings outstanding of approximately $610 million and $293 million under the EQM Credit Facility and the Eureka Credit Facility, respectively. See Note 11 for further information. \n (c) Interest payments exclude interest related to the EQM Credit Facility, Eureka Credit Facility and term loans issued under the 2019 EQM Term Loan and ETRN Term Loan as the interest rates on the credit facility borrowings and the term loans are variable. \n (d) Purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms, including the approximate timing of the transaction. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's purchase obligations included commitments for capital expenditures, operating expenses and service contracts. \n (e) Operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings, as well as lease obligations for compression equipment under existing contracts with third parties. \n (f) Other liabilities represent commitments for estimated payouts as of December 31, 2019 for various Equitrans Midstream liability award plans. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" below and Note 10 for discussion of factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations. \nSee Note 18 for additional information on the proposed Intercompany Loan and the anticipated termination of the ETRN Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company and its subsidiaries, including EQM. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the Company and EQM are unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. The Company and EQM accrue legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when incurred. Each of the Company and EQM, as applicable, establishes reserves whenever it believes it to be appropriate for pending matters. Furthermore, after consultation with counsel and considering available insurance, the Company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against it, EQM or any of their respective subsidiaries will not materially affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.\nSee \"The regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is challenging, and recent decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending proceedings could impact EQM's or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the projected time frame or at all or EQM's ability to achieve the expected investment return on the projects.\" under \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to EQM's Business\" included in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" and see \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" for discussion of litigation and regulatory proceedings related to the MVP project.\nSee Note 14 for further discussion of the Company's commitments and contingencies.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSee Note 8 for discussion of the MVP Joint Venture guarantees.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRecently issued accounting standards relevant to the Company are described in Note 1.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The following critical accounting policies, which were reviewed by the Company's Audit Committee, relate to its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nIncome Taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements or tax returns.\nThe Company has federal and state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards related to federal and various state jurisdictions. The federal and states of Virginia and West Virginia NOL carryforwards have no expiration, but utilization is limited to 80% of taxable income in the year of utilization. The Company's Pennsylvania NOL carryforwards expire in 2039. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain federal and state NOL carryforwards will be realized. In addition to the NOL carryforwards, the Company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from its investments in partnerships. No valuation allowances have been established because the Company believes that future sources of taxable income, reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets. Any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the Company's income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made.\nValuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carry-back periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carry-forward period, including from tax planning strategies, and experience. The Company has not noted any significant negative evidence.\nDeferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized, and changes in facts and circumstances may result in the establishment of a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence that apply to valuation allowance establishment. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset for which a valuation is recorded will be realized, all or a portion of the valuation allowance may be released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates from law changes.\nTax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold; otherwise, the tax benefit is recorded when the tax position has been effectively settled, either because the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed its examination. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.\nThe Company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are \"critical accounting estimates\" because the Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, exercise judgment when evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions. To the extent that a valuation allowance or an uncertain tax position is established or increased or decreased during a period, the Company includes an expense or benefit within income tax expense on the statements of comprehensive income. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions. See Note 12 for additional information.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. Determination of depreciation requires judgment regarding the estimated useful lives and salvage values of property, plant and equipment. The Company has not historically experienced material changes in its results of operations from changes in the estimated useful lives or salvage values of its property, plant and equipment; however, these estimates are reviewed periodically, including each time Equitrans, L.P. files with the FERC for a change in its transmission, storage and gathering rates. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to depreciation is a \"critical accounting estimate\" because it is susceptible to change. These assumptions affect depreciation expense and, if changed, would have an effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 for additional information.\nImpairments of Long-Lived Assets, Including Intangible Assets and Goodwill. Any accounting estimate related to impairment of property, plant and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets, goodwill or an investment in an unconsolidated entity may require the Company's management to make assumptions about future cash flows, discount rates, the fair value of investments and whether losses in the value of its investments are other than temporary. Management's assumptions about future cash flows require significant judgment because actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future.\nGoodwill is the cost of an acquisition less the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company uses a combination of an income and market approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. See Notes 1 and 3 for additional information.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to impairments are \"critical accounting estimates\" because they require assumptions that are susceptible to change, including estimating fair value which requires considerable judgment. For goodwill, management's estimate of a reporting unit's future financial results is sensitive to changes in assumptions, such as changes in stock prices, weighted-average cost of capital, terminal growth rates and industry multiples. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions used in estimating its reporting units' fair values are reasonable and appropriate, however, different assumptions and estimates could materially affect the calculated fair value and the resulting conclusion on impairment of goodwill, which could materially affect the Company's results of operations and financial position. Additionally, actual results could differ from these estimates. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis for the RMP PA Gas Gathering reporting unit (defined and discussed in Note 1), which is the only reporting unit with goodwill as of December 31, 2019, to quantify the effect of certain changes to assumptions used in the goodwill assessment. It was determined that a 1% increase to the weighted average cost of capital and a corresponding 1% decrease to the terminal cash flow growth rate would have resulted in the Company's recognition of approximately $81.3 million of additional impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2019.\nThe Company's investments in unconsolidated entities also require considerable judgment to estimate fair value because the Company's investments are not traded on an active market. Additionally, investments in unconsolidated entities are susceptible to impairment risk from further adverse macroeconomic conditions or other adverse factors such as permit and litigation matters impacting the MVP project. Such matters could cause further significant delays in the timing and costs of the MVP project which could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges relating to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities.\nAny potential impairment would have an effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position. See Notes 1 and 3 for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue from the gathering, transmission and storage of natural gas is generally recognized when the service is provided. Revenue from water services is generally recognized when water is delivered. For all contracts, EQM allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the judgmentally determined relative standalone selling price. When applicable, the excess of consideration received over revenue recognized results in the deferral of those amounts until future periods based on a units of production or straight-line methodology as these methods appropriately match the consumption of services provided to the customer. The units of production methodology requires the use of production estimates that are uncertain and the use of judgment when developing estimates of future production volumes, thus impacting the rate of revenue recognition. Production estimates are monitored as circumstances and events warrant. Certain of our gas gathering and water agreements have MVCs. If a customer under such an agreement fails to meet its MVC for a specified period (thus not exercising all the contractual rights to gathering and water services within the specified period, herein referred to as breakage\u201d), it is obligated to pay a contractually determined fee based upon the shortfall between the actual gathered or water volumes and the MVC for the period contained in the contract. Based on management's judgment, it is probable that the customer will not exercise all or a portion of its remaining rights, we recognize revenue associated with such breakage amount in proportion to the pattern of exercised rights within the respective MVC period.\nRevenue related to services provided but not yet billed is estimated each month. These estimates are generally based on contract data, preliminary throughput and allocation measurements. Final bills for the current month are billed and collected in the following month. See Note 4 for additional information.\nEQM records a provision for accounts receivable that are estimated to be uncollectible. In order to calculate the appropriate provision, an estimated loss rate of accounts receivable as a percentage of total revenue is used. This estimated loss rate is applied to the outstanding accounts receivable and is updated periodically based on a customer's credit rating or other events that could impact the estimated loss rate, such as a significant change to the natural gas industry or to the economy as a whole. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis using the assumptions that apply at that time. While EQM has not historically experienced material bad debt expense, declines in the market price for natural gas affecting producer activity combined with the increase in customers on EQM's systems may result in a greater exposure to potential losses than management's current estimates.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to revenue recognition are \"critical accounting estimates\" because estimated volumes are subject to change based on actual measurements, including prior period adjustments. In addition, the Company believes that the accounting estimates related to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable are \"critical accounting estimates\" because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change and the actual mix of customers and their ability to pay may vary significantly from management's estimates, which could affect the collectability of customer accounts. These accounting estimates could potentially have a material effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.\nBusiness Combinations. During the second quarter of 2019, EQM recorded the Bolt-on Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting; accordingly, the values assigned to the assets and liabilities are based on EQM's purchase price accounting estimates. Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires a company to record the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities at fair value. The estimated fair value of midstream facilities and equipment, which generally consist of pipeline systems and compression stations, was estimated using the cost approach. Significant unobservable inputs in the estimate of fair value include management's assumptions about the replacement costs for similar assets, the relative age of the acquired assets and any potential economic or functional obsolescence associated with the acquired assets. The fair value of intangible assets was determined using the income approach, which requires a forecast of the expected future cash flows generated and an estimated market-based weighted average cost of capital. Significant unobservable inputs in the determination of fair value include future revenue estimates, future cost assumptions and estimated customer retention rates.\nGiven the time required to obtain pertinent information necessary to finalize the allocation of the purchase price to the acquired net assets, the purchase price allocation remained preliminary for a period of time before the required fair value estimates were finalized. It is not uncommon for the"}
