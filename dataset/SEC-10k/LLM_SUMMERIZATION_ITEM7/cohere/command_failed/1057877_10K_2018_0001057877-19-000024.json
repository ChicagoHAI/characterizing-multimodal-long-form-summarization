MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) in this report, the general financial condition and results of operations for IDACORP and its subsidiaries and Idaho Power and its subsidiary are discussed. While reading the MD&A, please refer to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of IDACORP and Idaho Power. Also refer to \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and Part I - Item 1A - \"Risk Factors\" in this report for important information regarding forward-looking statements made in this MD&A and elsewhere in this report.\nINTRODUCTION\nIDACORP is a holding company whose principal operating subsidiary is Idaho Power. IDACORP's common stock is listed and trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol \"IDA\". Idaho Power is an electric utility whose rates and other matters are regulated by the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC), Public Utility Commission of Oregon (OPUC), and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Idaho Power generates revenues and cash flows primarily from the sale and distribution of electricity to customers in its Idaho and Oregon service areas, as well as from the wholesale sale and transmission of electricity.\nIdaho Power is the parent of Idaho Energy Resources Co. (IERCo), a joint venturer in Bridger Coal Company (BCC), which mines and supplies coal to the Jim Bridger generating plant owned in part by Idaho Power. IDACORP's other notable subsidiaries include IDACORP Financial Services, Inc. (IFS), an investor in affordable housing and other real estate investments; and Ida-West Energy Company, an operator of small hydroelectric generation projects that satisfy the requirements of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA).\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nIDACORP is committed to its focus on competitive total returns and generating long-term value for shareholders. IDACORP's business strategy emphasizes Idaho Power as IDACORP's core business, since Idaho Power's regulated electric utility operations are the primary driver of IDACORP's operating results. This strategy is described in Part I, Item 1 - \"Business - Business Strategy\" of this report. Examples of IDACORP's and Idaho Power's achievements and recognitions during 2018 include:\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>IDACORP achieved net income growth for an eleventh consecutive year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>IDACORP provided a 14 percent cumulative annual total shareholder return over the past three years, including share price appreciation and dividends paid, ranking in the 63rd percentile among peer companies in the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Electric Utilities Index;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>IDACORP received its second EEI Electric Utilities Index award in the past three years, for the best total shareholder return performance among small cap utilities (market capitalization of less than $5 billion) over the past five years, measured as of September 30, 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>IDACORP increased its quarterly common stock dividend from $0.59 per share to $0.63 per share, as a part of a 110 percent increase in quarterly dividends approved over the last seven years under the company's objective to pay dividends at the upper end of the range of 50 percent to 60 percent of sustainable earnings;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Idaho Power's customer count grew 2.3 percent in 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Idaho Power ranked second in J.D.

Customer growth added $10.3 million to Idaho Power's operating income compared with 2017. Sales volumes on a per-customer basis decreased operating income by $9.4 million in 2018 compared with 2017. A decrease in sales volumes to residential customers was partially offset by an increase in usage per irrigation customer. Milder temperatures in 2018 compared with 2017 caused residential customers to use 6 percent less electricity per customer, mostly for cooling and heating purposes, while decreased precipitation led agricultural irrigation customers to use 9 percent more electricity per customer to operate irrigation pumps. However, due mostly to the lower usage by Idaho residential customers, the FCA mechanism added $17.7 million to operating income during 2018 compared with 2017.\nThe net decrease in retail revenues per MWh reduced operating income by $26.9 million in 2018 compared with 2017. The settlement stipulations approved by the IPUC and OPUC during the second quarter of 2018 relating to recent income tax reform reduced revenues by approximately $22 million in 2018. The timing of the revenue reductions may not align with decreases in income tax expense in any given period due to the method and timing of customer rate reductions provided for in the settlement\nstipulations, the nature and timing of income tax accruals, discrete items, and other items discussed in more detail in the \"Income Tax Reform\" section below. Also, a change in customer sales mix reduced the retail revenues per MWh as volumes sold to residential customers made up a smaller portion of the customer sales mix.\nDuring 2018, Idaho Power benefited from a $16.1 million increase in transmission wheeling and other revenues, compared with 2017. This change was largely due to a 37 percent increase in the Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) rate in October 2017, partially offset by a 10 percent decrease in the OATT rate in October 2018 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in wheeling volumes.\nOther O&M expenses included $4.0 million of non-cash amortization expense of regulatory deferrals that would otherwise be a future liability of Idaho customers, as provided by the settlement stipulation approved by the IPUC related to income tax reform. Excluding the non-cash amortization of regulatory deferrals, other O&M expenses were $13.8 million higher in 2018 compared with 2017. In 2018, compared with 2017, higher maintenance service costs led to a $4.2 million increase in transmission and distribution asset maintenance expenses, and higher variable employee-related costs led to an $8.4 million increase in labor and benefit expenses.\nIn 2018, Idaho Power recorded $5.0 million as a provision against current revenues to be refunded to customers through a future rate reduction, through the Idaho-jurisdiction power cost adjustment (PCA) mechanism pursuant to a settlement stipulation with the IPUC as described in \"Regulation of Rates and Cost Recovery\" below.\nIdaho Power's $5.7 million remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from the federal and Idaho income tax rate change (discussed in further detail below) on the adjustment of temporary differences as a result of IDACORP's 2017 consolidated income tax return filings and the $1.3 million flow-through benefit of a tax deductible make-whole premium that Idaho Power paid in connection with the early redemption of long-term debt in April 2018 decreased Idaho Power's income tax expense by $7.0 million in 2018. Idaho Power recorded $2.0 million of income tax expense in 2017 for the initial remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from the federal and Idaho income tax rate change. Excluding these items, Idaho Power income tax expense was $23.9 million lower during 2018 compared with 2017, due mostly to the lower federal and state statutory income tax rates resulting from income tax reform.\n2018 Initiatives and Strategy\nIDACORP's strategy is focused on four areas: growing to enhance financial strength, improving Idaho Power's core business, enhancing Idaho Power's brand, and focusing on safety and employee engagement. IDACORP's board of directors has reviewed and affirmed IDACORP's long-term strategy. In executing on these four strategic focus areas, IDACORP seeks to balance the interests of shareowners, Idaho Power customers, employees, and other stakeholders. Idaho Power is working to continue to provide safe, fair-priced, reliable service to its customers from a diversified source of generation resources, with a continued commitment to strong, sustainable financial results. For more information on the business strategy of the companies, see Part I, Item 1 - Business - Business Strategy\u201d in this report.\nOverview of General Factors and Trends Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition are affected by a number of factors, and the impact of those factors is discussed in more detail below in this MD&A. To provide context for the discussion elsewhere in this report, some of the more notable factors include the following:\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Regulation of Rates and Cost Recovery: The price that Idaho Power is authorized to charge for its electric and transmission service is a critical factor in determining IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. Those rates are established by state regulatory commissions and the FERC and are intended to allow Idaho Power an opportunity to recover its expenses and earn a reasonable return on investment. Idaho Power focuses on timely recovery of its costs through filings with its regulators, working to put in place innovative regulatory mechanisms, and on the prudent management of expenses and investments. Idaho Power has regulatory settlement stipulations in Idaho that include provisions for the accelerated amortization of certain tax credits to help achieve a minimum 9.5 percent (9.4 percent after 2019) return on year-end equity in the Idaho jurisdiction (Idaho ROE). The settlement stipulations also provide for the potential sharing between Idaho Power and customers of Idaho-jurisdictional earnings in excess of specified levels of Idaho ROE. The settlement stipulations provide for modifications of certain terms and the indefinite extension of the mechanism beyond the original termination date of December 31, 2019. The specific terms of these settlement stipulations are described in \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A and in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. During\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2019, Idaho Power will continue to assess the need to file a general rate case to reset base rates, but does not anticipate filing a rate case in the next twelve months.\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Income Tax Reform: In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, which lowered the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and modified or eliminated certain federal income tax deductions for corporations (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). The majority of the changes, including the rate reduction, became effective on January 1, 2018. In March 2018, Idaho House Bill 463 was signed into law reducing the Idaho state corporate income tax rate from 7.4 percent to 6.925 percent. In May 2018, the IPUC issued an order approving a settlement stipulation related to these changes in income taxes (May 2018 Idaho Tax Reform Settlement Stipulation). Beginning June 1, 2018, the settlement stipulation provided an annual (a) $18.7 million reduction to Idaho customer base rates and (b) $7.4 million for the amortization of regulatory deferrals that would otherwise be a future liability recoverable from Idaho customers. Additionally, a one-time benefit of a $7.8 million rate reduction is being provided to Idaho customers through the PCA mechanism during the period from June 2018 through May 2019, for the income tax reform benefits accrued from January 2018 to May 2018 and for amounts included in Idaho Power's transmission revenues. The May 2018 Idaho Tax Reform Settlement Stipulation was designed to return to Idaho customers their share of the estimated annual pro forma tax expense reductions resulting from income tax reform, based on the full-year 2017 as required by the IPUC. Idaho Power's financial results from 2018 forward will be affected by any differences between annual income tax expense and the pro forma 2017 income tax expense used in the settlement until incorporated into a future rate proceeding or rate case. Refer to \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A for more information on the related regulatory proceedings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Economic Conditions and Loads: Economic conditions impact consumer demand for energy, revenues, collectability of accounts, the volume of wholesale energy sales, and the need to construct and improve infrastructure, purchase power, and implement programs to meet customer load demands. In recent years, Idaho Power has seen growth in the number of customers in its service area. In 2018, Idaho Power's customer count grew by 2.3 percent, and employment in Idaho Power's service area grew by approximately 2.2 percent based on Idaho Department of Labor preliminary December 2018 data. Idaho Power expects its number of customers to continue to increase in the foreseeable future. Idaho Power has in recent years supported State of Idaho-coordinated efforts to promote economic development with an emphasis on attracting industrial and commercial customers to its service area.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn August 2018, Idaho Power began preparing its 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), Idaho Power's long-term forecast of loads and resources. For more information on the 2019 IRP, including the preliminary load forecast assumptions Idaho Power expects to use in its 2019 IRP, refer to \"Resource Planning\" in Item 1 - \"Business\" in this Form 10-K.\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Weather Conditions: Weather and agricultural growing conditions have a significant impact on Idaho Power's energy sales. Relatively low and high temperatures result in greater energy use for heating and cooling, respectively. During the agricultural growing season, which in large part occurs during the second and third quarters, irrigation customers use electricity to operate irrigation pumps, and weather conditions can impact the timing and extent of use of those pumps. Idaho Power also has tiered rates and seasonal rates, which contribute to increased revenues during higher-load periods, most notably during the third quarter of each year, when overall customer demand is highest. Much of the adverse or favorable impact of weather on sales of energy to Idaho residential and small commercial customers is mitigated through the FCA mechanism, which is described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements in this report.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFurther, as Idaho Power's hydroelectric facilities comprise approximately one-half of Idaho Power's nameplate generation capacity, precipitation levels impact the mix of Idaho Power's generation resources. When hydroelectric generation is reduced, Idaho Power must rely on more expensive generation sources and purchased power. When favorable hydroelectric generating conditions exist for Idaho Power, they also may exist for other Pacific Northwest hydroelectric facility operators, lowering regional wholesale market prices and impacting the revenue Idaho Power receives from wholesale energy sales of its excess power. Much of the adverse or favorable impact of this volatility is addressed through the Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms.\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Rate Base Growth and Infrastructure Investment: As noted above, the rates established by the IPUC and OPUC are determined with the intent to provide an opportunity for Idaho Power to recover authorized operating expenses and earn a reasonable return on rate base.\u201d Rate base is generally determined by reference to the original cost (net of accumulated depreciation) of utility plant in service and certain other assets, subject to various adjustments for deferred taxes and other items. Over time, rate base is increased by additions to utility plant in service and reduced by depreciation and retirement of utility plant and write-offs as authorized by the IPUC and OPUC. In recent years, Idaho\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPower has been pursuing significant enhancements to its utility infrastructure in an effort to maintain system reliability, ensure an adequate supply of electricity, and to provide service to new customers, including major ongoing transmission projects such as the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West projects. Idaho Power's existing hydroelectric and thermal generation facilities also require continuing upgrades and equipment replacement, and the company is undertaking a significant relicensing effort for the HCC, its largest hydroelectric generation resource. Idaho Power intends to pursue timely inclusion of any significant completed capital projects into rate base as part of a future general rate case or other appropriate regulatory proceeding.\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Mitigation of Impact of Fuel and Purchased Power Expense: In addition to hydroelectric generation, Idaho Power relies heavily on natural gas and coal to fuel its generation facilities and power purchases in the wholesale markets. Fuel costs are impacted by electricity sales volumes, the terms and conditions of contracts for fuel, Idaho Power's generation capacity, the availability of hydroelectric generation resources, transmission capacity, energy market prices, and Idaho Power's hedging program for managing fuel costs. Recently, low natural gas prices have made operation of Idaho Power's natural gas power plants more economical, resulting in increased operation of those plants and decreased operation of coal-fired plants. Purchased power costs are impacted by the terms and conditions of contracts for purchased power, the rate of expansion of alternative energy generation sources such as wind or solar energy, and wholesale energy market prices. The Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms mitigate in large part the potential adverse impacts of fluctuations in power supply costs to Idaho Power.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Regulatory and Environmental Compliance Costs: Idaho Power is subject to extensive federal and state laws, policies, and regulations, as well as regulatory actions and audits by agencies and quasi-governmental agencies, including the FERC, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Compliance with these requirements directly influences Idaho Power's operating environment and affects Idaho Power's operating costs. Recently, energy industry regulators have issued substantial penalties for utilities alleged to have violated reliability and critical infrastructure protection requirements. Moreover, environmental laws and regulations, in particular, may increase the cost of operating generation plants, including Idaho Power's coal-fired plants, and constructing new facilities, require that Idaho Power install additional pollution control devices at existing generating plants, or require that Idaho Power cease operating certain generation plants. Idaho Power expects to spend a considerable amount on environmental compliance and controls in the next decade, and due to economic factors in part associated with the costs of compliance with environmental regulation, has accelerated the retirement dates of certain of its coal-fired power plants.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Water Management and Relicensing of the Hells Canyon Hydroelectric Project: Because of Idaho Power's reliance on stream flow in the Snake River and its tributaries, Idaho Power participates in numerous proceedings and venues that may affect its water rights, seeking to preserve the long-term availability of its rights for its hydroelectric projects. Also, Idaho Power is involved in renewing its long-term federal license for the HCC, its largest hydroelectric generation source. Given the number of parties and issues involved, Idaho Power's relicensing costs have been and are expected to continue to be substantial. Idaho Power cannot currently determine the terms of, and costs associated with, any resulting long-term license.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section of MD&A takes a closer look at the significant factors that affected IDACORP's and Idaho Power's earnings.

A degree-day measures how much the average daily temperature varies from 65 degrees. Each degree above 65 degrees is counted as one cooling degree-day, and each degree below 65 degrees is counted as one heating degree-day. While Boise, Idaho weather conditions are not necessarily representative of weather conditions throughout Idaho Power's service area, the greater Boise area has the majority of Idaho Power's customers.\n(2) Normal heating degree-days and cooling degree-days elements are, by convention, the arithmetic mean of the elements computed over 30 consecutive years. The annual normal amounts are the sum of the 12 monthly normal amounts. These normal amounts are computed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nSales Volume and Generation: In 2018, retail sales volumes were relatively flat compared with those of the prior year. Customer growth increased sales volumes during 2018 compared with 2017, with the number of Idaho Power's customers growing by 2.3 percent. During 2018, usage per irrigation customer was approximately 9 percent higher compared with 2017. Precipitation in the Idaho Power service area during 2018 was significantly less than in 2017, which increased usage by irrigation customers in 2018. Usage per residential customer was approximately 6 percent lower in 2018 compared with 2017. The decrease in residential usage was primarily due to milder weather during 2018 compared with 2017, which decreased the use of electricity for heating and cooling purposes. Cooling degree-days in Boise, Idaho were 17 percent lower during 2018 compared with 2017, but 18 percent above normal. Heating degree-days in Boise, Idaho were 12 percent lower during 2018 compared with 2017, and 10 percent below normal. Also, bundled energy sales (electric power combined with renewable energy certificates) volumes increased during 2018 compared with 2017. The solar generation projects under PURPA contracts that were initiated in 2017 generated an increased number of renewable energy credits to sell bundled with electricity.\nTotal system generation decreased 2 percent during 2018 compared with 2017. Hydroelectric generation decreased 2 percent during 2018 compared with 2017, but comprised 65 percent of Idaho Power's total system generation during both 2018 and 2017. In 2018, purchased power increased 28 percent compared with 2017 due to an increase in power purchased from generation projects under mandatory PURPA contracts and an increase in other purchased power resulting from favorable wholesale gas and electricity market conditions and, to a lesser extent, transactions in the Western EIM, which commenced in\nApril 2018. The availability of hydroelectric generation and an increase in purchased power during 2018 reduced thermal generation compared with 2017.\nWholesale energy sales volumes increased 312 thousand MWh, or 16 percent, during 2018 compared with 2017, due primarily to an increase in purchased power, both in market purchases and in purchases under PURPA contracts, resulting in increased energy available for wholesale energy sales. However, the high purchase price of power under federally mandated PURPA purchases is often in excess of the price at which Idaho Power sells the power in the wholesale energy markets.\nThe financial impacts of fluctuations in wholesale energy sales, purchased power, fuel expense, and other power supply-related expenses are addressed in Idaho Power's Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms, which are described below in \"Power Cost Adjustment Mechanisms.\"\nOperating Revenues\nRetail Revenues: The table below presents Idaho Power's retail revenues (in thousands), MWh sales

represent revenue from contracts with customers.\n(2) As part of its January 30, 2009, general rate case order, the IPUC is allowing Idaho Power to recover a portion of the allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) on construction work in progress related to the HCC relicensing process, even though the relicensing process is not yet complete and the costs have not been moved to electric plant in service. Idaho Power is collecting approximately $8.8 million annually in the Idaho jurisdiction but is deferring revenue recognition of the amounts collected until the license is issued and the accumulated license costs approved for recovery are placed in service. Prior to the May 2018 Idaho Tax Reform Settlement Stipulation described in \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A, Idaho Power was collecting $10.7 million annually.\nChanges in rates, changes in customer demand, and changes in FCA mechanism revenues are the primary reasons for fluctuations in retail revenues from period to period. See \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A for a list of rate changes implemented over the last three years. The primary influences on customer demand for electricity are weather, economic conditions, and energy efficiency. Extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating, while mild temperatures decrease sales. Precipitation levels and the timing of precipitation during the agricultural growing season also affect sales to customers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps. Rates are also seasonally adjusted, providing for higher rates during summer peak load periods, and residential customer rates are tiered, providing for higher rates\nbased on higher levels of usage. The seasonal and tiered rate structures contribute to seasonal fluctuations in revenues and earnings.\nRetail Revenues - 2018 Compared with 2017: Retail revenues decreased $30.8 million in 2018 compared with 2017. The primary factors affecting retail revenues during the period were the following:\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Rates: Rate changes decreased retail revenues by $39.0 million in 2018 compared with 2017.

The timing of the revenue reductions may not align with decreases in income tax expense in any given period due to the method and timing of customer rate reductions provided for in the settlement stipulations, the nature and timing of income tax accruals, discrete items, and other items discussed in this MD&A. The rates include collection of amounts related to the PCA mechanism, which decreased revenues by $15.4 million in 2018 compared with 2017. The collection of amounts related to the PCA mechanism in rates has no effect on operating income as a corresponding amount is recorded as expense in the same period it is collected through rates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Customers: Customer growth of 2.3 percent increased retail revenues by $13.5 million in 2018 compared with 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Usage: Lower usage (on a per customer basis), primarily by residential customers, decreased retail revenues by $18.0 million during 2018 compared with 2017.

Wholesale energy sales volumes increased 16 percent in 2018 compared with 2017, and the average price of wholesale energy sales was 84 percent higher for 2018 compared with 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2018, a natural gas pipeline ruptured in British Columbia, Canada, disrupting natural gas flows to the Pacific Northwest and Western Canada, driving up energy and natural gas prices in the region, including in Idaho Power's service area. An increase in purchased power, both in market purchases and in purchases under PURPA contracts, resulted in additional energy available for wholesale energy sales in 2018 compared with 2017. However, the high purchase price of power under federally mandated PURPA purchases is often in excess of the price at which Idaho Power sells the power in the wholesale energy markets. The increase in wholesale energy sales volumes and sales prices during 2018 compared with 2017 was also due to transactions in the Western EIM, which commenced in April 2018. Under the Western EIM, participating parties enable their systems to interact for automated intra-hour economic dispatch of generation from committed resources to serve loads.\nWholesale Energy Sales - 2017 Compared with 2016: For 2017, wholesale energy sales revenue increased by $12.9 million, or 108 percent compared with 2016 as generation from Idaho Power's hydroelectric plants increased due to significantly greater precipitation in 2017 compared with 2016. The increase in hydroelectric generation resulted in more energy available for wholesale energy sales in 2017 compared with 2016. The average price of wholesale energy sales was 20 percent lower for 2017 compared with 2016, as an increase in output from hydroelectric resources in the northwest United States region due to increased precipitation during the period, as well as additional output from new wind and solar projects throughout the region, increased surplus power available for sale and decreased wholesale power market prices.\nTransmission Wheeling Revenues: Revenue from transmission wheeling increased $15.1 million, or 34 percent, in 2018 compared with 2017, largely due to Idaho Power's OATT rate that increased in October 2017 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in wheeling volumes. In October 2017, Idaho Power's OATT rate increased from $25.52 per kW-year to $34.90 per kW-year. In October 2018, the rate decreased to $31.25 per kW-year. Refer to \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A for more information on Idaho Power's OATT rate. Revenue from transmission wheeling increased $11.5 million, or 35 percent, in 2017 compared with 2016, largely due to an increase in wheeling volumes, an increase in Idaho Power's OATT rate, and a new long-term wheeling agreement that became effective in July 2016.\nEnergy Efficiency Program Revenues: In both Idaho and Oregon, energy efficiency riders fund energy efficiency program expenditures. Expenditures funded through the riders are reported as an operating expense with an equal amount recorded in revenues, resulting in no net impact on earnings. The cumulative variances between expenditures and amounts collected through the riders are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. A liability balance indicates that Idaho Power has collected more than it has spent and an asset balance indicates that Idaho Power has spent more than it has collected. At December 31, 2018, Idaho Power's energy efficiency rider balances were a $5.3 million regulatory liability in the Idaho jurisdiction and a $1.4 million regulatory asset in the Oregon jurisdiction.\nOperating Expenses\nPurchased Power: The table below presents Idaho Power's purchased power expenses and volumes for the last three years (in thousands, except for MWh amounts).\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PURPA contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other purchased power (including wheeling)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total purchased power expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>293,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MWh purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PURPA contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other purchased power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total MWh purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost per MWh from PURPA contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost per MWh from other sources\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Weighted average - all sources\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIdaho Power is required by federal law to purchase power from some PURPA generation projects at a specified price regardless of the then-current load demand or wholesale energy market prices. The intermittent, non-dispatchable nature of most PURPA generation increases the likelihood that Idaho Power will at times be required to reduce output from its lower-cost hydroelectric and fossil fuel-fired generation resources and may be required to sell its excess power in the wholesale power market at a significant loss. The other purchased power cost per MWh often exceeds the wholesale energy sales revenue per MWh because Idaho Power generally needs to purchase more power during heavy load periods than during light load periods, and conversely has less energy available for wholesale energy sales during heavy load periods than light load periods. Market energy prices are typically higher during heavy load periods than during light load periods. Also, in accordance with Idaho Power's risk management policy, Idaho Power may purchase or sell energy several months in advance of anticipated delivery. The regional energy market price is dynamic and additional energy transactions that Idaho Power makes at current market prices may be noticeably different than the advance transaction prices. Most of the non-PURPA purchased power and substantially all of the PURPA power purchase costs are recovered through base rates and Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms.\nPurchased Power - 2018 Compared with 2017: Purchased power expense increased $44.9 million, or 18 percent, in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to a 65 percent increase in the volume of other non-PURPA power purchases and a 9 percent increase in the volume of power purchases from generation projects under PURPA contracts. Other purchased power volumes increased during 2018 compared with 2017 due to wholesale gas and electricity market conditions and due to transactions in the Western EIM, which commenced in April 2018. These volume increases were partially offset by decreases in cost per MWh of power purchased from sources other than PURPA contracts.\nPurchased Power - 2017 Compared with 2016: Purchased power expense increased $3.2 million, or 1 percent, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to an increase in generation provided by PURPA solar contracts. The increase in PURPA volumes was partially offset by decreases in costs per MWh. Other purchased power expense decreased $12.9 million, or 14 percent, as abundant hydroelectric generation in 2017 compared with 2016 reduced the need for market purchases to meet load requirements.\nFuel Expense: The table below presents Idaho Power's fuel expenses and thermal generation for the last three years (in thousands, except per MWh amounts).\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total fuel expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MWh generated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total MWh generated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost per MWh - Coal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost per MWh - Natural gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average, all sources\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes a negligible amount of expense and generation related to the Salmon diesel-fired generation plant.\nThe majority of the fuel for Idaho Power's jointly-owned coal-fired plants is purchased through long-term contracts, including purchases from BCC, a one-third owned joint venture of IERCo. The price of coal from BCC is subject to fluctuations in mine operating expenses, geologic conditions, and production levels. BCC supplies up to two-thirds of the coal used by the Jim Bridger plant. Natural gas is mainly purchased on the regional wholesale spot market at published index prices. In addition to commodity (variable) costs, both natural gas and coal expenses include costs that are more fixed in nature for items such as capacity charges, transportation, and fuel handling. Period to period variances in fuel expense per MWh are noticeably impacted by these fixed charges when generation output is substantially different between the periods.\nFuel Expense - 2018 Compared with 2017: Fuel expense decreased $12.6 million, or 9 percent, in 2018 compared with 2017. In October 2018, a natural gas pipeline ruptured in British Columbia, Canada, which disrupted natural gas distribution to the Pacific Northwest region and Western Canada, and drove up energy prices in the region. In accordance with its ongoing risk management policies, Idaho Power held a number of financial gas hedges at the time of the rupture. Fuel expense in the fourth quarter of 2018 included $23.3 million in gains on financial gas hedges, which reduced natural gas fuel expense. Idaho Power was able to meet natural gas needs by purchasing physical gas from sources unaffected by the rupture. Most of these realized hedging gains will be a benefit to customers through the power cost adjustment mechanisms described below.\nFuel Expense - 2017 Compared with 2016: Fuel expense decreased $33.7 million, or 19 percent, in 2017 compared with 2016, due primarily to increased output from Idaho Power's hydroelectric plants, which reduced utilization of gas and coal generation. Generation from the hydroelectric plants increased 39 percent during 2017 compared with 2016.\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanisms: Idaho Power's power supply costs (primarily purchased power and fuel expense, less wholesale energy sales) can vary significantly from year to year. Volatility of power supply costs arises from factors such as weather conditions, wholesale market prices, volumes of power purchased and sold in the wholesale markets, Idaho Power's hydroelectric and thermal generation volumes and fuel costs, generation plant availability, and retail loads. To address the volatility of power supply costs, Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms in the Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions allow Idaho Power to recover from customers, or refund to customers, most of the fluctuations in power supply costs. In the Idaho jurisdiction, the PCA includes a cost or benefit sharing ratio that allocates the deviations in net power supply expenses between customers (95 percent) and Idaho Power (5 percent), with the exception of PURPA power purchases and demand response program incentives, which are allocated 100 percent to customers. The Idaho deferral period, or PCA year, runs from April 1 through March 31. Amounts deferred during the PCA year are primarily recovered or refunded during the subsequent June 1 through May 31 period. Because of the power cost adjustment mechanisms, the primary financial impacts of power supply cost variations is that cash is paid out but recovery from customers does not occur until a future period, or cash that is collected is refunded to customers in a future period, resulting in fluctuations in operating cash flows from year to year.\nThe table below presents the components of the Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms for the last three years (in thousands).\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Power supply cost accrual (deferral)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(43,841\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of prior year authorized balances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total power cost adjustment expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,330\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe power supply accruals represent the portion of the power supply cost fluctuations accrued under the power cost adjustment mechanisms. When actual power supply costs are lower than the amount forecasted in power cost adjustment rates, which was the case for 2018 and 2017, most of the difference is accrued. When actual power supply costs are higher than the amount forecasted in power cost adjustment rates, which was the case for 2016, most of the difference is deferred. The amortization of the prior year's balances represents the offset to the amounts being collected or refunded in the current power cost adjustment year that were deferred or accrued in the prior power cost adjustment year (the true-up component of the power cost adjustment mechanism).\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanisms - 2018 Compared with 2017: Actual net power supply costs decreased in 2018 relative to forecasted costs, resulting in a change of $26.9 million-from accruals of $14.7 million to accruals of $41.5 million. The increase in accruals is due in part to lower natural gas fuel costs and purchased power, as explained above, combined with more surplus sales than forecasted. In addition, Idaho Power recorded $0.6 million of amortization of the prior-year authorized balances in 2018, compared with $37.4 million of amortization in 2017.\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanisms - 2017 Compared with 2016: Actual net power supply costs decreased in 2017 relative to forecasted costs, resulting in a change of $58.5 million-from deferrals of $43.8 million to accruals of $14.7 million. The change from deferrals in 2016 to accruals in 2017 is due in part to the lower fuel costs and purchased power, combined with more surplus sales than forecasted. The $37.4 million of amortization of prior year authorized balances in 2017 offsets the collection from customers of prior years' deferrals.\nOther Operations and Maintenance Expenses: The changes in other O&M expenses for the periods presented are discussed below.\nO&M - 2018 Compared with 2017: Other O&M expenses increased $17.8 million, or 5 percent, in 2018 compared with 2017. As provided by the settlement stipulation approved by the IPUC related to recent income tax reform, other O&M expenses in 2018 also included $4.0 million of non-cash amortization expense of regulatory deferrals that would otherwise be a future liability of Idaho customers. In 2018, compared with 2017, higher maintenance service costs led to a $4.2 million increase in transmission and distribution asset maintenance expenses, and higher variable employee-related costs led to an $8.4 million increase in labor and benefit expenses.\nO&M - 2017 Compared with 2016: Other O&M expense decreased by $2.2 million in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to a $2.4 million decrease related to previously expensed energy efficiency rider-funded costs deemed to be prudently incurred and a $2.7 million decrease in thermal O&M expenses due to lower generation at thermal plants. These decreases in O&M were partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in O&M related to a settlement stipulation in Idaho that established the reasonableness of the HCC relicensing costs incurred through December 2015 as further discussed in \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A.\nIncome Taxes\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's 2018 income tax expense decreased $31.3 million and $33.0 million, respectively, when\ncompared with 2017. The decrease was primarily due to: (1) the Tax Cut and Jobs Act's reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent that became effective January 1, 2018, (2) the remeasurement of deferred income tax balances related to IDACORP's 2017 consolidated income tax return filings, and (3) a flow-through income tax benefit at Idaho Power related to the tax deduction for a bond make-whole premium that was paid in 2018.\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's 2017 income tax expense increased $12.2 million and $14.1 million, respectively, when\ncompared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings at Idaho Power in 2017, and the $5.6 million\nflow-through benefit of a tax deductible make-whole premium that Idaho Power paid in connection with the early redemption of long-term debt in 2016. There were no early redemptions of long-term debt in 2017. These increases in income tax expense\nwere partially offset by greater net flow-through income tax items at Idaho Power.\nFor additional information relating to IDACORP's and Idaho Power's income taxes, the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the availability of tax credit carryforwards, see Note 2 - Income Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nIdaho Power continues to pursue significant enhancements to its utility infrastructure in an effort to ensure an adequate supply of electricity, to provide service to new customers, and to maintain system reliability. Idaho Power's existing hydroelectric and thermal generation facilities also require continuing upgrades and component replacement. Idaho Power's cash expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, excluding AFUDC, were $268 million in 2018, $277 million in 2017, and $287 million in 2016. Idaho Power expects these substantial capital expenditures to continue, with estimated total capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion expected over the period from 2019 through 2023.\nIdaho Power funds its liquidity needs for capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, debt offerings, commercial paper markets, credit facilities, and capital contributions from IDACORP. As of February 15, 2019, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's access to debt, equity, and credit arrangements included:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>their respective $100 million and $300 million revolving credit facilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>IDACORP's shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on May 20, 2016, which may be used for the issuance of debt securities and common stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Idaho Power's shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on May 20, 2016, which may be used for the issuance of first mortgage bonds and debt securities; $280 million is available for issuance pursuant to state regulatory authority; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>IDACORP's and Idaho Power's issuance of commercial paper, which may be issued up to an amount equal to the available credit capacity under their respective credit facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on planned capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expenses for 2019, the companies believe they will be able to meet capital requirements and fund corporate expenses during 2019 with a combination of existing cash and operating cash flows generated by Idaho Power's utility business, together with proceeds from either draws on credit facilities or Idaho Power's issuance of debt securities. IDACORP and Idaho Power believe they could meet any short-term cash shortfall with existing credit facilities and expect to continue to manage short-term liquidity through commercial paper markets.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power monitor capital markets with a view toward opportunistic debt and equity transactions, taking into account current and potential future long-term needs. As a result, IDACORP may issue debt securities or common stock, and Idaho Power may issue debt securities, if the companies believe terms available in the capital markets are favorable and that issuances would be financially prudent. Idaho Power also periodically analyzes whether partial or full early redemption of one or more existing outstanding series of first mortgage bonds is desirable, and in some cases, may refinance indebtedness with new indebtedness. To that end, in March 2018, Idaho Power issued $220 million in principal amount of 4.20% first mortgage bonds, Series K, maturing on March 1, 2048. In April 2018, Idaho Power redeemed, prior to its maturity, its $130 million in principal amount of 4.50% first mortgage bonds, Series H, due March 2020. In accordance with the redemption provisions of the original terms of the notes, the redemption included Idaho Power's payment of a make-whole premium of $4.6 million, the cost of which provided a flow-through tax deduction. Idaho Power used a portion of the net proceeds of the March 2018 sale of first mortgage bonds, medium term-notes to effect the redemption.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power seek to maintain capital structures of approximately 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity, and maintaining this ratio influences IDACORP's and Idaho Power's debt and equity issuance decisions. As of December 31, 2018, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's capital structures, as calculated for purposes of applicable debt covenants, were as follows:\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIDACORP and Idaho Power generally maintain their cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid investments, such as U.S. Treasury Bills, money market funds, and bank deposits.\nOperating Cash Flows\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's principal sources of cash flows from operations are Idaho Power's sales of electricity and transmission capacity. Significant uses of cash flows from operations include the purchase of fuel and power, other operating expenses, interest, income taxes, and pension plan contributions. Operating cash flows can be significantly influenced by factors such as weather conditions, rates and the outcome of regulatory proceedings, and economic conditions. As fuel and purchased power are significant uses of cash, Idaho Power has regulatory mechanisms in place that provide for the deferral and recovery of the majority of the fluctuation in those costs. However, if actual costs rise above the level allowed in retail rates, deferral balances increase (reflected as a regulatory asset), negatively affecting operating cash flows until such time as those costs, with interest, are recovered from customers.\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating cash inflows in 2018 were $492 million and $418 million, respectively, an increase of $57 million for IDACORP and a $1 million increase for Idaho Power when compared with 2017. Significant items that affected the companies' operating cash flows in 2018 relative to 2017 were as follows:\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $14 million increase and $16 million increase in IDACORP and Idaho Power net income, respectively;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in regulatory assets and liabilities, mostly related to the relative amounts of power supply and fixed costs accrued or deferred and refunded or collected under Idaho rate mechanisms, decreased operating cash inflows by $9 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in deferred taxes and in taxes accrued and receivable combined to decrease cash flows by $22 million and increase cash flows by $28 million at IDACORP and Idaho Power, respectively;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Idaho Power received $29 million of distributions from IERCo's investment in BCC for 2018, compared with $23 million in 2017.

Idaho Power's construction expenditures, including AFUDC, were $278 million, $285 million, and $297 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. These capital expenditures were primarily for construction of utility infrastructure needed to address Idaho Power's aging plant and equipment, customer growth, and environmental and regulatory compliance requirements. As discussed in \"Capital Requirements\" below, Idaho Power received $22 million and $6 million in 2018 and 2017 from Boardman-to-Hemingway project joint permitting participants relating to a portion of these construction expenditures.\nIdaho Power has a Rabbi trust designated to provide funding for obligations of its nonqualified defined benefit plans. In the Rabbi trust, Idaho Power purchased available-for-sale securities of $11 million in both 2018 and 2017, and $15 million in 2016. Idaho Power received $5 million of proceeds from the sales of available-for-sale securities in both 2018 and 2017, and $16 million in 2016. Idaho Power did not use any of these proceeds to acquire company-owned life insurance in 2018 and 2017 but used $10 million of the proceeds to acquire company-owned life insurance in 2016.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nFinancing activities provide supplemental cash for both day-to-day operations and capital requirements as needed. Idaho Power funds liquidity needs for capital investment, working capital, managing commodity price risk, and other financial commitments through cash flows from operations, debt offerings, commercial paper markets, credit facilities, and capital contributions from IDACORP. IDACORP funds its cash requirements, such as payment of taxes, capital contributions to Idaho Power, and non-utility operating expenses through cash flows from operations, commercial paper markets, sales of common stock, and credit facilities. The following are significant items and transactions that affected financing cash flows in 2018, 2017, and 2016:\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>on March 16, 2018, Idaho Power issued $220 million in principal amount of 4.20% first mortgage bonds Series K, maturing March 1, 2048;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>on April 17, 2018, Idaho Power redeemed, prior to maturity, $130 million of its 4.50% first mortgage bonds, Series H, due March 1, 2020, and paid a related make-whole premium of $4.6 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>on March 10, 2016, Idaho Power issued $120 million in principal amount of 4.05% first mortgage bonds, Series J, maturing on March 1, 2046;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>on April 11, 2016, Idaho Power redeemed, prior to maturity, $100 million in principal amount of 6.15% first mortgage bonds, Series H, due April 1, 2019, and paid a related make-whole premium of $14 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>IDACORP and Idaho Power paid dividends of approximately $121 million, $113 million, and $105 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>IDACORP's net change in commercial paper borrowings used cash of $22 million and provided cash of $2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Idaho Power borrowed $22 million in commercial paper in December 2016, which was paid off in January of 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing Programs and Available Liquidity\nIdaho Power First Mortgage Bonds: Idaho Power's issuance of long-term indebtedness is subject to the approval of the IPUC, OPUC, and Wyoming Public Service Commission (WPSC). In April and May 2016, Idaho Power received orders from the IPUC, OPUC, and WPSC authorizing Idaho Power to issue and sell from time to time up to $500 million in aggregate principal amount of debt securities and first mortgage bonds, subject to conditions specified in the orders. Authority from the IPUC is effective through May 31, 2019, subject to extension upon request to the IPUC. The OPUC's and WPSC's orders do not impose a time limitation for issuances, but the OPUC order does impose a number of other conditions, including a requirement that the interest rates for the debt securities or first mortgage bonds fall within either (a) designated spreads over comparable U.S. Treasury rates or (b) a maximum interest rate limit of seven percent.\nOn September 27, 2016, Idaho Power entered into a selling agency agreement with seven banks named in the agreement in connection with the potential issuance and sale from time to time of up to $500 million in aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds, secured medium term notes, Series K (Series K Notes), under Idaho Power's Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated as of October 1, 1937, as amended and supplemented (Indenture). At the same time, Idaho Power entered into the Forty-eighth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of September 1, 2016, to the Indenture (Forty-eighth Supplemental Indenture). The Forty-eighth Supplemental Indenture provides for, among other items, (a) the issuance of up to $500 million in aggregate principal amount of Series K Notes pursuant to the Indenture and (b) the increase of the maximum amount of obligations to be secured by the Indenture to $2.5 billion (which maximum amount may be further increased or decreased by Idaho Power without the consent of the holders of first mortgage bonds). As of the date of this report, Idaho Power has $280 million available for the issuance of first mortgage bonds, including Series K Notes, or debt securities under the selling agency agreement.\nThe issuance of first mortgage bonds requires that Idaho Power meet interest coverage and security provisions set forth in the Indenture. Future issuances of first mortgage bonds are subject to satisfaction of covenants and security provisions set forth in the Indenture, market conditions, regulatory authorizations, and covenants contained in other financing agreements.\nThe Indenture limits the amount of first mortgage bonds at any one time outstanding to $2.5 billion, and as a result, the maximum amount of first mortgage bonds Idaho Power could issue as of December 31, 2018, was limited to approximately $669 million. Idaho Power may increase the $2.5 billion limit on the maximum amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding by filing a supplemental indenture with the trustee as provided in the Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust. Separately, the Indenture also limits the amount of additional first mortgage bonds that Idaho Power may issue to the sum of (a) the principal amount of retired first mortgage bonds and (b) 60 percent of total unfunded property additions, as defined in the Indenture. As of December 31, 2018, Idaho Power could issue approximately $1.9 billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on retired first mortgage bonds and total unfunded property additions.\nRefer to Note 5 - Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information regarding long-term financing arrangements.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power Credit Facilities: In November 2015, IDACORP and Idaho Power entered into credit agreements for $100 million and $300 million credit facilities, respectively. These facilities replaced IDACORP's and Idaho Power's existing Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreements, dated October 26, 2011, as amended. Each of the credit facilities may be used for general corporate purposes and commercial paper back-up. IDACORP's facility permits borrowings under a revolving line of credit of up to $100 million at any one time outstanding, including swingline loans not to exceed $10 million at any time and letters of credit not to exceed $50 million at any time. IDACORP's facility may be increased, subject to specified conditions, to $150 million. Idaho Power's facility permits borrowings through the issuance of loans and standby letters of credit of up to $300 million at any one time outstanding, including swingline loans not to exceed $30 million at any one time and letters of credit not to exceed $100 million at any time. Idaho Power's facility may be increased, subject to specified conditions, to $450 million. The interest rates for any borrowings under the facilities are based on either (1) a floating rate that is equal to the highest of the prime rate, federal funds rate plus 0.5 percent, or LIBOR rate plus 1.0 percent, or (2) the LIBOR rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin, provided that the federal funds rate and LIBOR rate will not be less than zero percent. The applicable margin is based on IDACORP's or Idaho Power's, as applicable, senior unsecured long-term indebtedness credit rating, as set forth on a schedule to the credit agreements. The companies also pay a facility fee based on the respective company's credit rating for senior unsecured long-term debt securities.\nEach facility contains a covenant requiring each company to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization equal to or less than 65 percent as of the end of each fiscal quarter. In determining the leverage ratio, consolidated indebtedness\u201d broadly includes all indebtedness of the respective borrower and its subsidiaries, including, in some instances, indebtedness evidenced by certain hybrid securities (as defined in the credit agreement). Consolidated total capitalization\u201d is calculated as the sum of all consolidated indebtedness, consolidated stockholders' equity of the borrower and its subsidiaries, and the aggregate value of outstanding hybrid securities. At December 31, 2018, the leverage ratios for IDACORP and Idaho Power were 44 percent and 46 percent, respectively. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to utilize the credit facilities is conditioned upon their continued compliance with the leverage ratio covenants included in the credit facilities. There are additional covenants, subject to exceptions, that prohibit certain mergers, acquisitions, and investments, restrict the creation of certain liens, and prohibit entering into any agreements restricting dividend payments from any material subsidiary. At December 31, 2018, IDACORP and Idaho Power believe they were in compliance with all facility covenants. Further, as of the date of this report, IDACORP and Idaho Power do not believe they will be in violation or breach of their respective debt covenants during 2019.\nThe events of default under both facilities include, without limitation, non-payment of principal, interest, or fees; materially false representations or warranties; breach of covenants; bankruptcy or insolvency events; condemnation of property; cross-default to certain other indebtedness; failure to pay certain judgments; change of control; failure of IDACORP to own free and clear of liens the voting stock of Idaho Power; the occurrence of specified events or the incurring of specified liabilities relating to benefit plans; and the incurring of certain environmental liabilities, subject, in certain instances, to cure periods.\nUpon any event of default relating to the voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy of IDACORP or Idaho Power or the appointment of a receiver, the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the applicable facility and to issue letters of credit will automatically terminate and all unpaid obligations will become due and payable. Upon any other event of default, the lenders holding greater than 50 percent of the outstanding loans or greater than 50 percent of the aggregate commitments (required lenders) or the administrative agent with the consent of the required lenders may terminate or suspend the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the facility and to issue letters of credit under the facility and/or declare the obligations to be due and payable. During an event of default under the facilities, the lenders may, at their option, increase the applicable interest rates then in effect and the letter of credit fee by 2.0 percentage points per annum. A ratings downgrade would result in an increase in the cost of borrowing, but would not result in a default or acceleration of the debt under the facilities. However, if Idaho Power's ratings are downgraded below investment grade, Idaho Power must extend or renew its authority for borrowings under its IPUC and OPUC regulatory orders.\nWhile the credit facilities provide for an original maturity date of November 6, 2020, the credit agreements grant IDACORP and Idaho Power the right to request up to two one-year extensions, in each case subject to certain conditions. On November 7, 2016, IDACORP and Idaho Power executed the first extension agreement and on November 7, 2017, executed the second extension agreement with the consent of all the lenders, extending the maturity date under both credit agreements to November 4, 2022. No other terms of the credit facilities, including the amount of permitted borrowing under the credit agreements, were affected by the extensions.\nWithout additional approval from the IPUC, the OPUC, and the WPSC, the aggregate amount of short-term borrowings by Idaho Power at any one time outstanding may not exceed $450 million. Idaho Power has obtained approval of the state public utility commissions of Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming for the issuance of short-term borrowings through November 2022.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power Commercial Paper: IDACORP and Idaho Power have commercial paper programs under which they issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time not to exceed the available capacity under their respective credit facilities, described above. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's credit facilities are available to the companies to support borrowings under their commercial paper programs. The commercial paper issuances are used to provide an additional financing source for the companies' short-term liquidity needs. The maturities of the commercial paper issuances will vary, but may not exceed 270 days from the date of issue. Individual instruments carry a fixed rate during their respective terms, although the interest rates are reflective of current market conditions, subjecting the companies to fluctuations in interest rates.\nAvailable Short-Term Borrowing Liquidity\nThe following table outlines available short-term borrowing liquidity as of the dates specified (in thousands): Table 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Identified for other use(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,245\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,245\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net balance available\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Port of Morrow and American Falls bonds that Idaho Power could be required to purchase prior to maturity under the optional or mandatory purchase provisions of the bonds, if the remarketing agent for the bonds were unable to sell the bonds to third parties.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) Holding company only.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below presents additional information about short-term commercial paper borrowing during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Table 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year end:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amount outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Daily average amount outstanding during the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>839\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate during the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum month-end balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Holding company only.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt February 15, 2019, IDACORP had no loans outstanding under its credit facility and no commercial paper outstanding, and Idaho Power had no loans outstanding under its credit facility and no commercial paper outstanding.\nImpact of Credit Ratings on Liquidity and Collateral Obligations\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's access to capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs in those markets, depends in part on their respective credit ratings. The following table outlines the ratings of Idaho Power's and IDACORP's securities, and the ratings outlook, by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services as of the date of this report:\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's Investors Service:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating Outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Issuer Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Mortgage Bonds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>None\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Secured Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>None\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Paper\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standard & Poor's Rating Services:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate Credit Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating Outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-Term Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Secured Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>None\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese security ratings reflect the views of the ratings agencies. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings and, accordingly, each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nIdaho Power maintains margin agreements relating to its wholesale commodity contracts that allow performance assurance collateral to be requested of and/or posted with certain counterparties. As of December 31, 2018, Idaho Power had no performance assurance collateral posted. Should Idaho Power experience a reduction in its credit rating on its unsecured debt to below investment grade, Idaho Power could be subject to requests by its wholesale counterparties to post additional performance assurance collateral, and counterparties to derivative instruments and other forward contracts could request immediate payment or demand immediate ongoing full daily collateralization on derivative instruments and contracts in net liability positions. Based upon Idaho Power's current energy and fuel portfolio and market conditions as of December 31, 2018, the amount of additional collateral that could be requested upon a downgrade to below investment grade is approximately $10.5 million. To minimize capital requirements, Idaho Power actively monitors its portfolio exposure and the potential exposure to additional requests for performance assurance collateral through sensitivity analysis.\nCapital Requirements\nIdaho Power's cash construction expenditures, excluding AFUDC, were $268 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The cash expenditure amount excludes net costs of removing assets from service. The table below presents Idaho Power's estimated accrual-basis expenditures for construction for 2019 through 2023 (in millions of dollars). The amounts in the table exclude AFUDC but include net costs of removing assets from service that Idaho Power expects would be eligible to be included in rate base in future rate case proceedings. However, given the uncertainty associated with the timing of infrastructure projects and associated expenditures, actual expenditures and their timing could deviate substantially from those set forth in the table.\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021-2023\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected capital expenditures (excluding AFUDC)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280-290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>285-300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>875-925\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInfrastructure Projects: A significant portion of expected capital expenditures included in the five-year forecast above relate to a large number of small projects as Idaho Power continues to add to its system to accommodate growth and improve reliability and operational effectiveness. These projects involve significant capital expenditures. Examples of anticipated system enhancements planned for 2019 through 2023 and estimated costs include the following:\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$35-$65 million per year for construction and replacement of transmission lines and stations other than the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West projects;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$85-$105 million per year for construction and replacement of distribution lines and stations, including replacement of underground distribution cables;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$20-$40 million per year for ongoing improvements and replacements at coal- and natural gas-fired plants;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$50-$70 million per year for hydroelectric plant improvement programs, including relicensing costs; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$40-$60 million per year for general plant improvements, such as land and buildings, vehicles, information technology, and communication equipment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Major Infrastructure Projects: Idaho Power has recently completed or is engaged in the development of a number of significant projects and has entered into arrangements with third parties for joint development of infrastructure projects. The most notable projects are described below.\nBoardman-to-Hemingway Transmission Line: The Boardman-to-Hemingway line, a proposed 300-mile, 500-kV transmission project between a station near Boardman, Oregon, and the Hemingway station near Boise, Idaho, would provide transmission service to meet future resource needs. In January 2012, Idaho Power entered into a joint funding agreement with PacifiCorp and the Bonneville Power Administration to pursue permitting of the project. The joint funding agreement provides that Idaho Power's interest in the permitting phase of the project would be approximately 21 percent, and that during future negotiations relating to construction of the transmission line, Idaho Power would seek to retain that percentage interest in the completed project. Total cost estimates for the project are between $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, including Idaho Power's AFUDC. This cost estimate is preliminary and excludes the impacts of inflation and price changes of materials and labor resources that may occur following the date of the estimate. Idaho Power's share of the permitting phase of the project (excluding AFUDC) is included in the capital requirements table above, in addition to approximately $50 million of Idaho Power's share of costs related to early construction efforts, which are primarily included in the period 2021-2023. These preliminary estimates of Idaho Power's share of early construction costs could significantly change as the construction timeline nears and as the project participants further align on future activities and estimates.\nApproximately $100 million, including AFUDC, has been expended on the Boardman-to-Hemingway project through December 31, 2018. Pursuant to the terms of the joint funding arrangements, Idaho Power has received $70 million as of December 31, 2018, due from project participants for their share of costs. As of the date of this report, no material participant reimbursements are outstanding. Joint permitting participants are obligated to reimburse Idaho Power for their share of any future project permitting expenditures incurred by Idaho Power.\nThe permitting phase of the Boardman-to-Hemingway project is subject to federal review and approval by the BLM, the U.S. Forest Service, the Department of the Navy, and certain other federal agencies. The BLM issued its record of decision for the project in November 2017, approving a right-of-way grant for the project to cross approximately 86 miles of BLM-administered land. The U.S. Forest Service issued its record of decision in November 2018 authorizing the project to cross approximately seven miles of National Forest lands. Idaho Power expects the U.S. Forest Service to issue its right-of-way easement in 2019. Idaho Power expects the Department of the Navy to issue its decision on whether to approve the project to cross approximately seven miles of Department of the Navy lands in the first quarter of 2019.\nIn the separate Oregon state permitting process, in September 2018, Idaho Power's application for site certificate was deemed complete by the Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE). The ODOE is expected to issue a draft proposed order on the application in the first half of 2019 providing the ODOE's recommendation on whether to issue a site certificate for construction in Oregon. Given the status of ongoing permitting activities and the construction period, Idaho Power expects the in-service date for the transmission line to be in 2026 or beyond.\nGateway West Transmission Line: Idaho Power and PacifiCorp are pursuing the joint development of the Gateway West project, a 500-kV transmission project between a station located near Douglas, Wyoming and the Hemingway station located near Boise, Idaho. In January 2012, Idaho Power and PacifiCorp entered a joint funding agreement for permitting of the project. Idaho Power has expended approximately $38 million, including AFUDC, for its share of the permitting phase of the project through December 31, 2018. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power estimates the total cost for its share of the project (including both permitting and construction) to be between $250 million and $450 million, including AFUDC. Idaho Power's estimated share of the permitting phase of the project (excluding AFUDC) is included in the capital requirements table above. Idaho Power's share of potential early construction costs are excluded from the capital requirements table above because the timing of construction of Idaho Power's portion of the project is uncertain.\nThe permitting phase of the Gateway West project was subject to review and approval of the BLM. The BLM released its record of decision in November 2013 for eight of the ten transmission line segments. In May 2017, a federal bill was signed into law that issued a right-of-way for certain portions of the remaining Gateway West segments. In April 2018, the BLM published its record of decision for the outstanding portions of the remaining segments. Idaho Power and PacifiCorp continue to coordinate the timing of next steps to best meet customer and system needs.\nHells Canyon Complex Relicensing: The HCC, located on the Snake River where it forms the border between Idaho and Oregon, provides approximately 68 percent of Idaho Power's hydroelectric generating nameplate capacity and 32 percent of its total generating nameplate capacity. Idaho Power has been engaged in the process of obtaining from the FERC a new long-term license for the HCC. The past and anticipated future costs associated with obtaining a new long-term license for the HCC are significant. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power estimates that the annual costs it will incur to obtain a new long-term license for the HCC, including AFUDC but excluding costs expected to be incurred for complying with the license after issuance, are likely to range from $30 million to $40 million until issuance of the license, which Idaho Power estimates will occur no earlier than 2022. Idaho Power expects that the annual capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expenses associated with compliance with the terms and conditions of the long-term license could also be substantial, but the company is currently unable to estimate those costs in light of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate terms and conditions that may be included in the license. Idaho Power intends to seek recovery of those relicensing and compliance costs in rates through the regulatory process. In December 2016, Idaho Power filed an application with the IPUC requesting a determination that Idaho Power's expenditures of $220.8 million through year-end 2015 on relicensing of the HCC were prudently incurred, and thus eligible for future inclusion in retail rates in a future rate proceeding. In December 2017, Idaho Power filed with the IPUC a settlement stipulation signed by Idaho Power, the IPUC staff, and a third party intervenor recognizing that a total of $216.5 million in expenditures were reasonably incurred, and therefore should be eligible for inclusion in customer rates at a later date. As a result of filing the settlement stipulation, Idaho Power recorded a $5.0 million pre-tax charge in 2017, which included $4.3 million for costs incurred through 2015 as well as $0.7 million related to associated costs incurred in 2016 and 2017. Of the $5.0 million pre-tax charge in 2017, $2.5 million was recorded as Other O&M expense and $2.5 million was recorded as a reduction to AFUDC. In April 2018, the IPUC issued an order approving the settlement stipulation as filed with IPUC and determined the associated costs to be reasonably and prudently incurred.\nJim Bridger Plant Selective Catalytic Reduction Equipment: Idaho Power and the plant co-owners completed installation of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment to reduce nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions at the Jim Bridger power plant, in order to comply with regional haze rules. The regional haze rules provided for installation of SCR on unit 3 and unit 4. The rules provide for an equivalent technology for NO2 reductions on unit 2 by 2021 and unit 1 by 2022.The unit 3 SCR was operating as of November 2015, and the unit 4 SCR was operating as of November 2016. In light of the substantial estimated cost of SCR installation, as of the date of this report, Idaho Power continues to assess whether to move forward with the installation of SCR on units 1 and 2 at the Jim Bridger power plant. The expected capital expenditures in the table above do not include any estimated expenditures relating to the installation of SCR on units 1 and 2.\nEnvironmental Regulation Costs: Idaho Power anticipates that it will incur significant expenditures for the installation of environmental controls at its coal-fired plants and for its hydroelectric relicensing efforts. The near-term cost estimates for environmental matters are summarized in Part I, Item 1 - \"Business - Environmental Regulation and Costs\" of this report. The capital portion of these amounts is included in the Capital Requirements table above but does not include costs related to\npossible changes in current or new environmental laws or regulations and enforcement policies that may be enacted in response to issues such as climate change and emissions from coal-fired and gas-fired generation plants.\nLong-Term Resource Planning: The IPUC and OPUC require that Idaho Power prepare biennially an IRP. The IRP seeks to forecast Idaho Power's loads and resources for a 20-year period, analyzes potential supply-side, demand-side, and transmission options, and identifies potential near-term and long-term actions. Idaho Power filed its most recent IRP with the IPUC and OPUC in June 2017. The 2017 IRP identified a preferred resource portfolio and action plan, which includes the completion of the Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission line by 2026, the end to Idaho Power's participation in coal-fired operations at the Valmy Plant units 1 and 2 in 2019 and 2025, respectively, and the early retirement of Jim Bridger units 1 and 2 in 2032 and 2028, respectively, with no other new resource needs prior to 2026. However, as noted in the 2017 IRP, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the resource sufficiency estimates and project completion dates, including uncertainty around the timing and extent of third party development of renewable resources, fuel commodity prices, environmental requirements, the actual completion date of the Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission project, and the economics and logistics of plant operation and retirements. These uncertainties, as well as others, could result in changes to the desirability of the preferred portfolio and adjustments to the timing and nature of anticipated and actual actions. Additional information on Idaho Power's 2017 IRP is included in Part I, Item 1 - \"Business - Resource Planning\" in this report.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan Contributions and Recovery\nIdaho Power contributed $40 million to its defined benefit pension plan in each year in 2018, 2017, and 2016. Idaho Power estimates that it has no minimum contribution requirement for 2019. Depending on market conditions and cash flow considerations in 2019, Idaho Power could contribute up to $40 million to the pension plan during 2019. Idaho Power's contributions are made in a continued effort to balance the regulatory collection of these expenditures with the amount and timing of contributions to mitigate the cost of being in an underfunded position. Beyond 2019, Idaho Power expects continuing significant contribution obligations under the pension plan. Refer to Note 12 - \"Benefit Plans\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and the section titled \"Contractual Obligations\" below in this MD&A for information relating to those obligations.\nIdaho Power defers its Idaho-jurisdiction pension expense as a regulatory asset until recovered from Idaho customers. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, Idaho Power's deferral balance associated with the Idaho jurisdiction was $148 million and $128 million, respectively. Deferred pension costs are expected to be amortized to expense to match the revenues received when contributions are recovered through rates. Idaho Power only records a carrying charge on the unrecovered balance of cash contributions. The IPUC has authorized Idaho Power to recover and amortize $17 million of deferred pension costs annually, and has applied $68 million against the deferred amount under its Idaho sharing mechanisms since 2011. The primary impact of pension contributions is on the timing of cash flows, as cost recovery lags behind the timing of contributions.\nIncome Tax Reform\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, which among other things, lowered the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and modified or eliminated certain federal income tax deductions for corporations. In March 2018, Idaho House Bill 463 was signed into law reducing the Idaho state corporate income tax rate from 7.4 percent to 6.925 percent. The majority of the law changes, including the rate reductions, became effective on January 1, 2018. See \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A for more information on the related regulatory proceedings and financial impacts.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents IDACORP's and Idaho Power's contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2018, for the respective periods in which they are due:\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions of dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future interest payments(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance and service agreements(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FERC and other industry-related fees(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cogeneration and small power production\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel supply agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(3)(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and postretirement benefit plans(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities - IDACORP only(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) For additional information, see Note 5 - Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) Future interest payments are calculated based on the assumption that all debt is outstanding until maturity.

As of the date of this report, Idaho Power cannot estimate pension contributions beyond 2023 with any level of precision, and amounts through 2023 are estimates only and are subject to change. For more information on pension and postretirement plans, refer to Note 12 - \"Benefit Plans\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDividends\nThe amount and timing of dividends paid on IDACORP's common stock are within the discretion of IDACORP's board of directors. IDACORP's board of directors reviews the dividend rate periodically to determine its appropriateness in light of IDACORP's current and long-term financial position and results of operations, capital requirements, rating agency considerations, contractual and regulatory restrictions, legislative and regulatory developments affecting the electric utility industry in general and Idaho Power in particular, competitive conditions, and any other factors the board of directors deems relevant. The ability of IDACORP to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power.\nIDACORP has a dividend policy that provides for a target long-term dividend payout ratio of between 50 and 60 percent of sustainable IDACORP earnings, with the flexibility to achieve that payout ratio over time and to adjust the payout ratio or to deviate from the target payout ratio from time to time based on the various factors that drive IDACORP's board of directors' dividend decisions. Notwithstanding the dividend policy adopted by IDACORP's board of directors, the dividends IDACORP pays remain in the discretion of the board of directors who, when evaluating the dividend amount, will continue to take into account the factors above, among others. In September of 2018, 2017, and 2016, IDACORP's board of directors voted to increase the quarterly dividend to $0.63 per share, $0.59 per share, and $0.55 per share of IDACORP common stock, respectively. IDACORP's dividends during 2018 were 53.5 percent of actual 2018 earnings.\nFor additional information relating to IDACORP and Idaho Power dividends, including restrictions on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's payment of dividends, see Note 7 - Common Stock\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nContingencies and Proceedings\nIDACORP and Idaho Power are involved in a number of litigation, alternative dispute resolution, and administrative proceedings, and are subject to claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, that could affect their future results of operations and financial condition. In many instances IDACORP and Idaho Power are unable to predict the outcomes of the matters or estimate the impact the proceedings may have on their financial positions, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIdaho Power is also actively monitoring various environmental regulations that may have a significant impact on its future operations. Given uncertainties regarding the outcome, timing, and compliance plans for these environmental matters, Idaho Power is unable to determine the financial impact of potential new regulations but does believe that future capital investment for infrastructure and modifications to its electric generating facilities to comply with these regulations could be significant.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough a self-bonding mechanism, Idaho Power guarantees its portion of reclamation activities and obligations at BCC, of which IERCo owns a one-third interest. This guarantee, which is renewed annually with the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ), was $58.4 million at December 31, 2018, representing IERCo's one-third share of BCC's total reclamation obligation of $175.2 million. BCC has a reclamation trust fund set aside specifically for the purpose of paying these reclamation costs. At December 31, 2018, the value of the reclamation trust fund totaled $101.9 million. During 2018, the reclamation trust fund made $6.7 million in distributions for reclamation activity costs associated with the BCC surface mine. BCC periodically assesses the adequacy of the reclamation trust fund and its estimate of future reclamation costs. To ensure that the reclamation trust fund maintains adequate reserves, BCC has the ability to, and does, add a per-ton surcharge to coal sales, all of which are made to the Jim Bridger plant. Because of the existence of the fund and the ability to apply a per-ton surcharge, the estimated fair value of this guarantee is minimal.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nIntroduction\nIdaho Power's regulatory strategy takes into consideration short-term and long-term needs for rate relief and involves several factors that can affect the timing of rate filings. These factors include, among others, in-service dates of major capital investments, the timing and magnitude of changes in major revenue and expense items, and customer growth rates. Idaho Power's most recent general rate cases in Idaho and Oregon were filed during 2011, and Idaho Power filed a large single-issue rate case for the Langley Gulch power plant in Idaho and Oregon in 2012. These significant rate cases resulted in the resetting of base rates in both Idaho and Oregon during 2012. Idaho Power also reset its base-rate power supply expenses in the Idaho jurisdiction for purposes of updating the collection of costs through retail rates in 2014 but without a resulting net increase in rates. Between general rate cases, Idaho Power relies upon customer growth, power cost adjustment mechanisms, tariff riders, and other mechanisms to reduce the impact of regulatory lag, which refers to the period of time between making an investment or incurring an expense and recovering that investment or expense and earning a return. Management's regulatory focus in recent years has been largely on regulatory settlement stipulations and the design of rate mechanisms. Idaho Power continues to assess the need and timing of filing a general rate case in its two retail jurisdictions, based on its consideration of the factors described above, but does not anticipate filing a general rate case in 2019.\nNotable Retail Rate Changes in Idaho and Oregon\nIncluded in the table that follows are notable regulatory developments during 2018, 2017, and 2016 that affected Idaho Power's results for the periods. Also refer to Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of regulatory mechanism and associated orders of the IPUC and OPUC, which should be read in conjunction with the discussion of regulatory matters in this MD&A.\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effective Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Annualized Rate Impact (millions)(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 2018 Idaho Tax Reform Settlement Stipulation - Idaho base rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 2018 Idaho Tax Reform Settlement Stipulation - Idaho PCA(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Idaho PCA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Idaho FCA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oregon Tax Reform Settlement Stipulation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oregon Valmy Plant Accelerated Depreciation Settlement Stipulation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oregon Valmy Plant Settlement Stipulation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7/1/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Idaho Valmy Plant Settlement Stipulation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 Idaho PCA(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 Idaho FCA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016 Idaho PCA(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016 Idaho FCA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) The annual amount collected or refunded in rates is typically not recovered or refunded on a linear basis (i.e., 1/12th per month), and is instead recovered or refunded in proportion to retail sales volumes.

In the general rate case, the IPUC issued an order approving a settlement stipulation that provided for an overall 7.86 percent authorized rate of return on an Idaho-jurisdiction rate base of approximately $2.36 billion. The settlement stipulation resulted in a $34.0 million overall increase in Idaho Power's annual Idaho-jurisdictional base rate revenues. Neither the IPUC's order nor the settlement stipulation specified an authorized rate of return on equity.\nEffective March 1, 2012, Idaho Power implemented new Oregon base rates resulting from its receipt of an order from the OPUC approving a settlement stipulation in its general rate case proceedings that provided for a $1.8 million base rate revenue increase, a rate of return on equity of 9.9 percent, and an overall rate of return of 7.757 percent in the Oregon jurisdiction.\nIdaho and Oregon base rates were subsequently adjusted again in 2012, in connection with Idaho Power's completion of the Langley Gulch power plant. In June 2012, the IPUC issued an order approving a $58.1 million increase in annual Idaho-jurisdiction base rate revenues, effective July 1, 2012, for inclusion of the investment and associated costs of the plant in rates. The order also provided for a $335.9 million increase in Idaho rate base. In September 2012, the OPUC issued an order approving a $3.0 million increase in annual Oregon jurisdiction base rate revenues, effective October 1, 2012, for inclusion of the investment and associated costs of the plant in Oregon rates.\nIn March 2014, the IPUC issued an order approving Idaho Power's application requesting an increase of approximately $106 million in the normalized or \"base level\" net power supply expense on a total-system basis to be used to update base rates and in the determination of the PCA rate that became effective June 1, 2014. Approval of the order removed the Idaho-jurisdictional portion of those expenses (approximately $99 million) from collection via the PCA mechanism and instead results in collecting that portion through base rates.\nValmy Base Rate Adjustment Settlement Stipulations\nIn May 2017, the IPUC approved a settlement stipulation, effective June 1, 2017, allowing accelerated depreciation and cost recovery for the Valmy Plant. The settlement stipulation provides for an increase in Idaho jurisdictional revenues of $13.3 million per year, and (1) levelized collections and associated cost recovery through December 2028, (2) accelerated depreciation on unit 1 through 2019 and unit 2 through 2025, (3) Idaho Power to use prudent and commercially reasonable efforts to end its participation in the operation of unit 1 by the end of 2019 and unit 2 by the end of 2025, and (4) a filing no later than December 31, 2019 that would include actual and planned incremental investments in unit 2, including updated financial analysis regarding the lowest costs options for unit 2. The costs intended to be recovered by the increased jurisdictional revenues include current investments as of May 31, 2017 in both units, forecasted unit 1 investments from 2017 through 2019, and forecasted decommissioning costs for unit 1 and unit 2, offset by forecasted operation and maintenance costs savings. The settlement stipulation also provides for the regulatory accrual or deferral of the difference between actual revenue requirements and levelized collections, and provides for the regulatory accrual or deferral of the difference between actual costs incurred (including accelerated depreciation expense on unit 1 through 2019 and unit 2 through 2025) compared with costs permitted to be recovered during the cost recovery period specified in the settlement stipulation (including depreciation expense through 2028). If actual costs incurred differ from forecasted amounts included in the settlement stipulation, collection or refund of any differences would be subject to regulatory approval.\nIn June 2017, the OPUC also approved a settlement stipulation allowing for accelerated depreciation of units 1 and 2 through December 31, 2025, cost recovery of incremental Valmy Plant investments through May 31, 2017, and forecasted decommissioning costs. The settlement stipulation provides for an increase in the Oregon jurisdictional revenue requirement of $1.1 million, effective July 1, 2017, with yearly adjustments, if warranted. As part of the May 2018 Oregon Income Tax Reform Settlement Stipulation described below, the OPUC also deemed prudent Idaho Power's decision to pursue the end of its participation in coal-fired operations of unit 1 by the end of 2019 and approved Idaho Power's request to recover annual incremental accelerated depreciation relating to unit 1, beginning June 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2019, resulting in a $2.5 million annualized revenue requirement.\nOther Notable Regulatory Matters\nDecember 2011 Idaho Earnings Support and Sharing Settlement Stipulation: In December 2011, the IPUC issued an order, separate from the then-pending Idaho general rate case proceeding, approving a settlement stipulation that allowed Idaho Power to, in certain circumstances, amortize additional accumulated deferred investment tax credits (ADITC) if Idaho Power's actual Idaho ROE for 2012, 2013, or 2014 was less than 9.5 percent, to help achieve a 9.5 percent Idaho ROE for the applicable year. Under the December 2011 Idaho Earnings Support and Sharing Settlement Stipulation, when Idaho Power's actual Idaho ROE for any of those years exceeded 10.0 percent, Idaho Power was required to share a portion of its Idaho-jurisdiction earnings with Idaho customers.\nOctober 2014 Idaho Earnings Support and Sharing Settlement Stipulation: In October 2014, the IPUC issued an order approving an extension, with modifications, of the terms of the December 2011 settlement stipulation for the period from 2015 through 2019, or until the terms are otherwise modified or terminated by order of the IPUC or the full $45 million of additional ADITC contemplated by the settlement stipulation has been amortized. The more specific terms and conditions of the October 2014 settlement stipulation are described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters - Notable Idaho Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. IDACORP and Idaho Power believe that the terms allowing amortization of additional ADITC in the October 2014 Idaho Earnings Support and Sharing Settlement Stipulation provide the companies with a greater degree of earnings stability than would be possible without the terms of the stipulation in effect. The October 2014 Idaho Earning Support and Sharing Settlement Stipulation was modified and indefinitely extended, as described in \"Income Tax Reform - Regulatory Treatment\" below.\nIn 2018, Idaho Power recorded a $5.0 million provision against current revenue for sharing with customers, as its full-year Idaho ROE for 2018 was above 10.0 percent. In both 2017 and 2016, Idaho Power did not record any additional ADITC amortization or any provision for sharing with customers, as its Idaho ROE in both years was between 9.5 percent and 10.0 percent. Accordingly, at December 31, 2018, the full $45 million of additional ADITC remains available for future use under the terms of the October 2014 Idaho Earnings Support and Sharing Settlement Stipulation.\nIdaho Power recorded the following for sharing with customers under the December 2011 and October 2014 Idaho Settlement Stipulations (in millions):\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Recorded as Refunds to Customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Recorded as a Pre-tax Charge to Pension Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2011(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) The 2011 sharing amounts were recorded pursuant to a regulatory mechanism preceding the December 2011 Idaho Earnings Support and Sharing Settlement Stipulation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Tax Reform - Regulatory Treatment: In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, which, among other things, lowered the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and modified or eliminated certain federal income tax deductions for corporations. In March 2018, Idaho House Bill 463 was signed into law reducing the Idaho state corporate income tax rate from 7.4 percent to 6.925 percent. In January 2018, the IPUC issued an order requiring utilities within its jurisdiction, including Idaho Power, to (1) record a regulatory liability for the estimated Idaho-jurisdictional share of financial benefits after January 1, 2018, from the changes in federal income tax law under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and (2) file a report with the IPUC by March 30, 2018, identifying and quantifying the financial impact of the income tax changes on the utility, along with proposed tariff schedule changes that would adjust the utility's rates and corresponding revenues to reflect the utility's modified federal tax obligations under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The IPUC order required Idaho Power to estimate the income tax reform changes by comparing actual 2017 federal income tax components with what those federal income tax components would have been if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act had been effective for the full-year 2017.\nIn March 2018, Idaho Power made a filing with the IPUC providing the results of its pro forma analysis indicating pro forma annual income tax reform expense reductions, composed of a current income tax expense reduction and a deferred income tax expense reduction. In May 2018, the IPUC issued an order approving a settlement stipulation (May 2018 Idaho Tax Reform Settlement Stipulation) related to income tax reform. Beginning June 1, 2018, the settlement stipulation provides an annual (a) $18.7 million reduction to Idaho customer base rates and (b) $7.4 million amortization of existing regulatory deferrals for specified items or future amortization of other existing or future unspecified regulatory deferrals that would otherwise be a future liability recoverable from Idaho customers. Additionally, a one-time benefit of a $7.8 million rate reduction is being provided to Idaho customers through PCA mechanism rates for the period from June 1, 2018 through May 31, 2019, for the income tax reform benefits accrued from January 1, 2018 to May 31, 2018, and the income tax reform benefits related to Idaho Power's OATT rate. The amount provided via the PCA mechanism will decrease to $2.7 million on June 1, 2019, for income tax reform benefits related to Idaho Power's OATT rate and will cease on June 1, 2020, to reflect the impact of a full year of reduced OATT third-party transmission revenues.\nThe May 2018 Idaho Tax Reform Settlement Stipulation provides for the extension of the October 2014 Idaho Earnings Support and Sharing Settlement Stipulation described above beyond the initial termination date of December 31, 2019, with modified terms related to the ADITC and revenue sharing mechanism to become effective beginning January 1, 2020. Neither the October 2014 Idaho Earnings Support and Sharing Settlement Stipulation nor the May 2018 Idaho Tax Reform Settlement Stipulation impose a moratorium on Idaho Power filing a general rate case or other form of rate proceeding in Idaho during their respective terms.\nAlso in May 2018, the OPUC issued an order approving a settlement stipulation that provides for an annual $1.5 million reduction to Oregon customer base rates beginning June 1, 2018, through May 31, 2020, related to income tax reform. Unless resolved in a regulatory proceeding before, the settlement stipulation requires Idaho Power to file a deferral request with the OPUC by December 31, 2019, to begin tracking income tax reform benefits beginning January 1, 2020, at which time Idaho Power, the OPUC staff, and other interested parties will discuss the methodology to quantify potential future income tax reform benefits.\nFor more information on the settlement stipulations and their impacts on results, see Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nCustomer-Owned Generation Filing: In July 2017, Idaho Power filed an application with the IPUC related to residential and small general service customers who install their own on-site generation, seeking to create two new customer classes, with no request to change pricing or compensation. In May 2018, the IPUC issued an order authorizing the creation of the new customer classes. In October 2018, Idaho Power filed petitions requesting the IPUC open two new proceedings to study the fixed-costs of providing electric service to customers, and to study the costs, benefits, and compensation of net excess energy supplied by customer on-site generation, respectively. In November 2018, the IPUC opened the proceedings. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power and the parties in both proceedings are continuing to determine the procedural and substantive scope for each proceeding.\nWestern Energy Imbalance Market Costs: Idaho Power's participation in the Western EIM commenced on April 4, 2018. The Western EIM is intended to reduce the power supply costs to serve customers through more efficient dispatch within the hour of a larger and more diverse pool of resources, to integrate intermittent power from renewable generation sources more effectively, and to enhance reliability. Financial benefits or costs resulting from participation in the Western EIM are subject to Idaho Power's PCA mechanism as described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. In January 2017, the IPUC issued an order authorizing deferral accounting treatment for costs associated with joining the Western EIM. In November 2017, Idaho Power filed an application with the IPUC requesting authorization to establish an interim method of recovery for Western EIM-related costs. In July 2018, the IPUC issued an order approving a settlement stipulation that provides for recovery through Idaho Power's PCA mechanism. For more information on the order and its impact on financial results, see Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nDeferred (Accrued) Net Power Supply Costs\nDeferred (accrued) power supply costs represent certain differences between Idaho Power's actual net power supply costs and the costs included in its retail rates, the latter being based on annual forecasts of power supply costs. Deferred (accrued) power supply costs are recorded on the balance sheets for future recovery (refund) through customer rates. Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms in its Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions provide for annual adjustments to the rates charged to retail customers. The power cost adjustment mechanisms and associated financial impacts are described in \"Results of Operations\" in this MD&A and in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nFactors that have influenced power cost adjustment rate changes in recent years include year-to-year volatility in hydroelectric generation conditions, market energy prices and the volume of wholesale energy sales, power purchase costs from renewable energy projects, income tax reform, and revenue sharing under Idaho regulatory settlement stipulations. From year to year, these factors can vary significantly, which can result in significant accruals and deferrals under the power cost adjustment mechanisms. The power cost adjustment rate changes reflected in the table under the heading \"Notable Retail Rate Changes in Idaho and Oregon\" are illustrative of the volatility of net power supply costs and the impact on power cost adjustment rates.\nThe following table summarizes the change in deferred (accrued) net power supply costs over the prior two years (in millions):\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Oregon\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current period net power supply costs accrued\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy efficiency rider funds transferred to Idaho PCA mechanism\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior amounts recovered through rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) allowance and renewable energy certificate (REC) sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current period net power supply costs accrued\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax reform revenue accrual to be refunded through Idaho PCA, net of amounts refunded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Western EIM cost recovery to be collected through Idaho PCA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior amounts refunded through rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SO2 allowance and REC sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(42.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(42.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOpen Access Transmission Tariff Rate Proceedings\nIdaho Power uses a formula rate for transmission service provided under its OATT, which allows transmission rates to be updated annually based primarily on financial and operational data Idaho Power files with the FERC. In August 2018, Idaho Power filed its 2018 final transmission rate with the FERC, reflecting a transmission rate of $31.25 per kW-year, to be effective for the period from October 1, 2018, to September 30, 2019. A \"kW-year\" is a unit of electrical capacity equivalent to 1 kilowatt of power used for 8,760 hours. Idaho Power's final rate was based on a net annual transmission revenue requirement of $123.1 million. The OATT rate in effect from October 1, 2017, to September 30, 2018, was $34.90 per kW-year based on a net annual transmission revenue requirement of $130.4 million. The decrease in the OATT rate is largely attributable to an increase in short-term transmission revenues in 2017, which serves as an offset to the transmission revenue requirement. Historic OATT rate information is included in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nRelicensing of Hydroelectric Projects\nOverview: Idaho Power, like other utilities that operate non-federal hydroelectric projects on qualified waterways, obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the FERC. These licenses have a term of 30 to 50 years depending on the size, complexity, and cost of the project. The expiration dates for the FERC licenses for each of the facilities are included in Part I - Item 2 - \"Properties\" in this report. Costs for the relicensing of Idaho Power's hydroelectric projects are recorded in construction work in progress until new multi-year licenses are issued by the FERC, at which time the charges are transferred to electric plant in service. Idaho Power expects to seek recovery of relicensing costs and costs related to a new long-term license through the regulatory process and, in December 2016, submitted a request for a determination of prudence of HCC relicensing costs, which is described below. Relicensing costs of $297 million (including AFUDC) for the HCC, Idaho Power's largest hydroelectric complex and a major relicensing effort, were included in construction work in progress at December 31, 2018. As of the date of this report, the IPUC authorizes Idaho Power to include in its Idaho jurisdiction rates approximately $8.8 million annually of AFUDC relating to the HCC relicensing project. Prior to the May 2018 Tax Reform Settlement Stipulation described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters,\" Idaho Power was collecting $10.7 million annually. Collecting these amounts currently will reduce future collections when the HCC relicensing costs are approved for recovery in base rates. As of December 31, 2018, Idaho Power's regulatory liability for collection of AFUDC relating to the HCC was $135 million. In addition to the discussion below, refer to \"Environmental Matters\" in this MD&A for a discussion of environmental compliance under FERC licenses for Idaho Power's hydroelectric generating plants.\nHells Canyon Complex: The HCC, located on the Snake River where it forms the border between Idaho and Oregon, provides approximately 68 percent of Idaho Power's hydroelectric generating nameplate capacity and 32 percent of its total generating nameplate capacity. In July 2003, Idaho Power filed an application with the FERC for a new license in anticipation of the July 2005 expiration of the then-existing license. Since the expiration of that license, Idaho Power has been operating the project under annual licenses issued by the FERC. In December 2004, Idaho Power and eleven other parties, including National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), involved in the HCC relicensing process entered into\nan interim agreement that addresses the effects of the ongoing operations of the HCC on Endangered Species Act (ESA) listed species pending the relicensing of the project. In August 2007, the FERC Staff issued a final environmental impact statement (EIS) for the HCC, which the FERC will use to determine whether, and under what conditions, to issue a new license for the project. The FERC may require an additional, updated EIS prior to the issuance of a new license for the HCC. The purpose of the final EIS is to inform the FERC, federal and state agencies, Native American tribes, and the public about the environmental effects of Idaho Power's operation of the HCC. Certain portions of the final EIS involve issues that may be influenced by water quality certifications for the project under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and formal consultations under the ESA, which remain unresolved.\nIn connection with its relicensing efforts, Idaho Power has filed water quality certification applications, required under Section 401 of the CWA, with the states of Idaho and Oregon requesting that each state certify that any discharges from the project comply with applicable state water quality standards. Section 401 of the CWA requires that a state either approve or deny a Section 401 water quality certification application within one year of the filing of the application or the state may be considered to have waived its certification authority under the CWA. As a consequence, Idaho Power has been filing and withdrawing its Section 401 certification applications with Oregon and Idaho on an annual basis while it has been working with the states to identify measures that will provide reasonable assurance that discharges from the HCC will adequately address applicable water quality standards. In the 2016 Section 401 certification application process, Oregon required Idaho Power to comply with fish passage and reintroduction conditions. Idaho's water quality certification, however, provides that Idaho Power shall take no action that may result in the reintroduction or establishment of spawning populations of any fish species into Idaho's waters without consultation with and express approval of the State of Idaho. In November 2016, Idaho Power filed a petition with the FERC requesting that the FERC resolve the conflict between Oregon's and Idaho's conditions and declare that the Federal Power Act (FPA) pre-empts the Oregon state law. In January 2017, the FERC issued an order denying Idaho Power's petition, stating that the petition for a declaratory order was premature, cannot realistically be considered separately from the issue of the states' certification authority under the CWA Section 401, and raises issues that are beyond the FERC's authority to decide. In February 2017, Idaho Power sought rehearing before the FERC on the January 2017 order, which the FERC denied. In February 2018, Idaho Power filed an appeal of the FERC's January 2017 order with the D.C. Circuit Court, which is pending.\nIn April 2017, the governors of Oregon and Idaho jointly requested that Idaho Power withdraw and resubmit its Section 401 certification applications in both states to allow the states additional time to negotiate a potential resolution of the disputed issues. As of June 2018, the states had not resolved their differences, requiring Idaho Power to again withdraw and resubmit its Section 401 certification applications in both states. In December 2018, the states of Idaho and Oregon, along with Idaho Power, reached a proposed settlement that requires Idaho Power to increase the number of Chinook salmon it releases each year through expanded hatchery production. Additionally, Idaho Power is required to fund a total of $12 million of research and water quality improvements in the HCC, over a 20-year period following the issuance of the license. These measures are in exchange for Oregon removing the fish passage requirement from the Oregon 401 certification for at least the first 20 years after final license issuance. Idaho Power estimates that the combined cost of the mandated water quality improvements and expanded hatchery production is $20 million over the term of the new license. Idaho and Oregon draft 401 certifications were released for public comment in December 2018. After the public comment period closes in February 2019, Idaho Power anticipates the states will evaluate the comments and draft final 401 certifications, which must be completed by June 2019 for the current cycle.\nIn September 2007, in connection with the issuance of its final EIS, the FERC notified the NMFS and the USFWS of its determination that the licensing of the HCC was likely to adversely affect ESA-listed species, including the bull trout and fall Chinook salmon and steelhead, under the NMFS's and USFWS's jurisdiction and requested that the NMFS and USFWS initiate formal consultation under Section 7 of the ESA on the licensing of the HCC. Each of the NMFS and USFWS responded to the FERC that the conditions relating to the licensing of the HCC were not fully described or developed in the final EIS as the measures to address the water quality effects of the project were yet to be fully defined by the Section 401 certification process. The NMFS and USFWS therefore recommended that formal consultation under the ESA be delayed until the Section 401 certification process is completed.\nIdaho Power continues to work with Idaho and Oregon in the development of measures to provide reasonable assurance that any discharges from the HCC will comply with applicable state water quality standards so that appropriate water quality certifications can be issued for the project, and continues to cooperate with the USFWS, NMFS, and the FERC in an effort to address ESA concerns. Idaho Power has begun construction of new aerated runners at the Brownlee project (part of the HCC) at an estimated cost of $59 million. Three of four units were installed by the end of 2018 and Idaho Power plans to install the final unit in 2019. Other measures that have been proposed or considered have included modification of spillways at the three dams in the HCC to address total dissolved gas issues, and upstream watershed improvements or the installation of a temperature\ncontrol structure to address water temperatures during a small portion of the year. If Idaho Power is required to take these or other additional measures to satisfy relicensing requirements, it could add substantially to project costs.\nAs of the date of this report, Idaho Power is unable to predict the timing of issuance by the FERC of any license order or the ultimate capital investment and ongoing operating and maintenance costs Idaho Power will incur in complying with any new license. However, as of the date of this report, Idaho Power estimates that the annual costs it will incur to obtain a new long-term license for the HCC, including AFUDC but excluding costs expected to be incurred for complying with the license after issuance, are likely to range from $30 million to $40 million until issuance of the license, which Idaho Power estimates will occur no earlier than 2022. In December 2016, Idaho Power filed an application with the IPUC requesting a determination that Idaho Power's expenditures of $220.8 million through year-end 2015 on relicensing of the HCC were prudently incurred, and thus eligible for future inclusion in retail rates in a future rate proceeding. In December 2017, Idaho Power filed with the IPUC a settlement stipulation signed by Idaho Power, the IPUC Staff, and a third party intervenor recognizing that a total of $216.5 million in expenditures were reasonably incurred, and therefore should be eligible for inclusion in customer rates at a later date. As a result of filing the settlement stipulation, Idaho Power recorded a $5.0 million pre-tax charge in 2017, which included $4.3 million for cost incurred through 2015, as well as $0.7 million related to associated costs incurred in 2016 and 2017. Of the $5.0 million pre-tax charge in 2017, $2.5 million was recorded as Other O&M expense and $2.5 million was recorded as a reduction to AFUDC. In April 2018, the IPUC issued an order approving the settlement stipulation as filed with the IPUC and determined the associated costs to be reasonably and prudently incurred.\nRenewable Energy Standards and Contracts\nRenewable Portfolio Standards: Many states have enacted legislation that would require electric utilities to obtain a specified percentage of their electricity from renewable sources. These requirements are commonly referred to as a \"renewable portfolio standard\" or \"RPS.\" However, as of the date of this report no State of Idaho RPS is in effect. Idaho Power will be required to comply with either a five- or ten-percent RPS in Oregon beginning in 2025 (depending on loads at that time), and Idaho Power expects to meet either RPS requirement with RECs obtained from the purchase of energy from the Elkhorn Valley wind project.\nPursuant to an IPUC order, Idaho Power is selling its near-term RECs and returning to customers their share (shared 95 percent with customers in the Idaho jurisdiction) of those proceeds through the PCA. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, Idaho Power's REC sales totaled $2.9 million, $2.3 million, and $1.0 million, respectively.\nWere Idaho Power to be subject to additional RPS legislation, it may cease in full or in part the sale of RECs it receives, seek to obtain RECs from additional projects, generate RECs from any REC-generating facilities it owns or may be required to construct in light of an RPS, or purchase RECs in the market. Historically, Idaho Power has generally not received the RECs associated with PURPA projects. However, an order issued by the IPUC in 2012 provides that Idaho Power will own a portion of the RECs generated by some PURPA projects. The required purchase of additional RECs to meet RPS requirements would increase Idaho Power's costs, which Idaho Power expects would be wholly or largely passed on to customers through rates and the power cost adjustment mechanisms.\nRenewable and Other Energy Contracts: Idaho Power has contracts for the purchase of electricity produced by third-party owned generation facilities, most of which produce energy with the use of renewable generation sources such as wind, solar, biomass, small hydroelectric and geothermal. The majority of these contracts are entered into as mandatory purchases under PURPA. As of December 31, 2018, Idaho Power had contracts to purchase energy from 127 on-line PURPA projects. An additional three contracts are with non-PURPA projects, including the Elkhorn Valley wind project with a 101-MW nameplate capacity. The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2018, the resource type and nameplate capacity of Idaho Power's signed agreements for energy purchases from PURPA and non-PURPA generating facilities. These agreements have original contract terms ranging from one to 35 years.\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Resource Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total On-line (MW)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Under Contract but not yet On-line (MW)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Projects under Contract (MW)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PURPA:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wind\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>627\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Solar\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hydroelectric\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total PURPA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-PURPA:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wind\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Geothermal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-PURPA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe projects not yet on-line include one hydroelectric project and five solar projects that are scheduled to be on-line in 2019.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nOverview\nIdaho Power's activities are subject to a broad range of federal, state, regional, and local laws and regulations designed to protect, restore, and enhance the environment, including the Clean Air Act (CAA), the CWA, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, and the ESA, among other laws. These laws are administered by a number of federal, state, and local agencies. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations and associated costs, these laws and regulations provide authority to regulators to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, injunctive relief, and other sanctions. Idaho Power's three co-owned coal-fired power plants and three natural gas-fired combustion turbine power plants are subject to many of these regulations. Idaho Power's 17 hydroelectric projects are also subject to a number of water discharge standards and other environmental requirements.\nCompliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations may:\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increase the operating costs of generating plants;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increase the construction costs and lead time for new facilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>require the modification of existing generating plants, which could result in additional costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>require the curtailment or shut-down of existing generating plants; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reduce the output from current generating facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCurrent and future environmental laws and regulations will increase the cost of operating fossil fuel-fired generation plants and constructing new generation and transmission facilities, in large part through the substantial cost of permitting activities and the required installation of additional pollution control devices. In many parts of the United States, some higher-cost, high-emission coal-fired plants have ceased operation or the plant owners have announced a near-term cessation of operation, as the cost of compliance makes the plants uneconomical to operate. The decision to agree to cease operation of the Boardman coal-fired plant, in which Idaho Power owns a 10 percent interest, by the end of 2020, was based in part on the significant future cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. The decision to pursue an end to participation in coal-fired operations at the Valmy Plant was also based primarily on the economics of operating the plant. Additionally, in light of the uncertainty resulting from pending environmental regulation and the substantial estimated cost of selective catalytic reduction equipment\n(SCR) installation, Idaho Power continues to assess whether to move forward with the installation of SCR on units 1 and 2 at the Jim Bridger power plant. Beyond increasing costs generally, these environmental laws and regulations could affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition if the costs associated with these environmental requirements and early plant retirements cannot be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis.\nPart I, Item 1 - Business - Utility Operations - Environmental Regulation and Costs\u201d in this report includes a summary of Idaho Power's expected capital and operating expenditures for environmental matters during the period from 2018 to 2020. Given the uncertainty of future environmental regulations and technological advances, Idaho Power is unable to predict its environmental-related expenditures beyond 2020, though they could be substantial. Furthermore, several executive orders issued in 2017 and 2018 concerning environmental regulations, as described below, could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation, and government policy regarding environmental matters. For example, in August 2017, an executive order was issued to accelerate federal agencies' environmental review and permitting for major infrastructure projects. The outcome of federal agencies' review of regulations covered by executive orders is difficult to predict. Changes to or elimination of regulations may lower Idaho Power's costs of operating and maintaining fossil fuel-fired generation plants and transmission lines, due to the reduction of potential environmental infrastructure upgrades or reduction or elimination of permitting requirements. Executive orders resulting in modifications to federal regulations could, on the other hand, be affected by Congressional action and challenged in court. Further, state and local governmental authorities could choose to replace the federal regulations or bolster environmental compliance and enforcement efforts at the local level, and therefore, Idaho Power is uncertain whether and to what extent the orders could affect its operations and environmental-related expenditures. Idaho Power plans to continue to monitor actions associated with or resulting from executive orders.\nEndangered Species Act Matters\nOverview: The listing of a species of fish, wildlife, or plants as threatened or endangered under the ESA may have an adverse impact on Idaho Power's ability to construct generation, transmission, or distribution facilities or relicense or operate its hydroelectric facilities. When a species is added to the federal list of threatened and endangered species, it is protected from take,\u201d which is defined to include harming the species. The ESA directs that, concurrent with a designation of a threatened or endangered species, and where prudent and determinable, the applicable agencies also designate any habitat of such species which is then considered to be critical habitat.\u201d The ESA also provides that each federal agency must ensure that any action they authorize, fund, or carry out is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of its critical habitat. If an action is determined to result in adverse modification of critical habitat, the federal agency must adopt changes to the proposed action to avoid the adverse modification. These changes are often quite extensive and can affect the size, scope, and even the feasibility of a project moving forward. In February 2016, the USFWS and the NMFS issued a set of regulatory and policy changes relating to critical habitat and adverse modification determinations under the ESA. While the ultimate impact of implementation of those changes is yet to be determined, taken as a whole, Idaho Power believes that the changes could result in the applicable agencies having greater authority in making designations of critical habitat and could increase the likelihood of adverse modification determinations.\nIn July 2018, the USFWS and the NMFS issued three proposals to revise ESA regulations (2018 ESA Proposals) related to the process and standards for listing species and designating critical habitat, the process for consultations with federal agencies under Section 7 of the ESA (including the definition of \"destructive or adverse modification\" of designated critical habitat), and the scope of protection of threatened species. Idaho Power believes that if the 2018 ESA Proposals are promulgated, the regulations could reduce Idaho Power's obligations for mitigation under the ESA related to various construction and relicensing projects. Furthermore, in November 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an area is eligible for designation as a critical habitat under the ESA only if it is also \"habitat\" for the species as defined in the statute, which generally means the area can support the species without modification, and as part of the designation, the USFWS must also consider the costs compared to the benefits of such designation. Idaho Power believes this ruling may limit the number of areas designated as critical habit and could also reduce Idaho Power's obligations for mitigation under the ESA.\nThe construction of generation, transmission, or distribution facilities and the relicensing of Idaho Power's hydroelectric projects can be federally authorized actions that fall under the ESA. There are a number of threatened or endangered species within Idaho Power's service area and within or near proposed transmission line routes, including the slickspot peppergrass. Further, there are a number of ESA-listed fish and other aquatic species located in waterways in which Idaho Power has hydroelectric facilities, including fall Chinook salmon, bull trout, Bliss Rapids snail, and Snake River physa snail. To date, efforts to protect these and other listed species have not significantly affected generation levels or operating costs at any of Idaho Power's hydroelectric facilities. However, the ongoing relicensing of the HCC presents endangered species and fisheries issues that may require operational adjustments and could adversely impact the amount of output from hydroelectric dams, potentially causing Idaho Power to rely on more expensive sources for power generation or market purchases.\nDevelopments in Regulation of Sage Grouse Habitat: In February 2016, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court of Idaho challenging the BLM's sage grouse resource management and land use plan revisions that became effective in 2015 under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The lawsuit challenges the plans and associated environmental impact statements across the sage grouse range and alleges that the plans fail to ensure that sage grouse populations and habitats will be protected and restored in accordance with the best available science and legal mandates. Further, the complaint challenges certain exemptions provided for the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West transmission line projects. Idaho Power has intervened in the proceedings in an effort to support the exemptions provided for in the BLM's plans. If the exemptions are overturned, Idaho Power may be required to re-route the projects, which could lead to substantially higher construction and permitting costs and could delay construction.\nIn May 2016, a separate lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court of North Dakota, challenging the BLM's sage grouse resource management and land use plan revisions, including the exemptions provided for the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West transmission line projects. In October 2016, the plaintiffs amended their complaint to no longer challenge the exemptions; however, in December 2016, the North Dakota court transferred claims challenging certain Idaho land use plan amendments to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Idaho Power is participating in the proceedings in an effort to protect its interests.\nIn June 2017, the Secretary of the Interior issued an order directing the BLM to review the 2015 sage grouse resource management and land use plan revisions and to identify provisions that may require modification or rescission to address energy and other development of public lands. In December 2018, the BLM issued draft resource management plan amendments and a final environmental impact statements to modify the 2015 sage grouse plans to better align the plan with state plans, conservation measures and the Department of the Interior and BLM policy. As of the date of this report, the above lawsuits are stayed as the parties and the courts have agreed that the processes initiated by the BLM may result in further administrative actions that could remove the need for the lawsuits.\nESA Issues Related to Specific Projects:\nHells Canyon Relicensing Project: In 2007, the FERC requested initiation of formal consultation under the ESA with the NMFS and the USFWS regarding potential effects of HCC relicensing on several listed aquatic and terrestrial species. Formal consultation has yet to be initiated and the NMFS and the USFWS continue to gather and consider information relative to the effects of relicensing on relevant ESA listed species. Idaho Power continues to cooperate with the USFWS, the NMFS, and the FERC in an effort to address ESA concerns. In December 2004, Idaho Power and eleven other parties, including NMFS and the USFWS, entered into an interim agreement that addresses the effects of the ongoing operations of the HCC on ESA listed species pending the relicensing of the project. At the conclusion of formal consultation and with the issuance of biological opinions by the NMFS and the USFWS and an operating license by the FERC, Idaho Power may be required to implement additional measures or further modify or adjust operations to comply with Section 7 of the ESA. The issuance of a final biological opinion during 2019 is unlikely.\nBoardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West Transmission Projects: In August 2016, the USFWS re-instated the threatened species status of slickspot peppergrass. Most of the species are located on federal land. Idaho Power expects the listing of the slickspot peppergrass and its existence within or near the proposed routes for the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West transmission line projects to continue to impact the cost and timing of permitting and construction of the projects, as it requires an ESA Section 7 consultation. The USFWS has also indicated it intends to designate critical habitat for the species. If critical habitat is designated within the vicinity of the transmission line projects, Idaho Power expects that the designation could increase the cost of obtaining permits for the projects and could further delay the in-service date of the projects.\nEndangered Species Act and National Environmental Policy Act Developments: In May 2016, the United States District Court for the District of Oregon issued an opinion finding that in the context of hydroelectric facilities owned and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and located on the lower Snake River, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) violated the ESA by using improper standards, failing to consider adequately the impact of climate change on habitat conditions, and placing undue reliance on unproven, future federal habitat conservation measures, particularly to the degree that the success of the measures could be undermined by climate change. The court also found that other federal agencies violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by failing to prepare a comprehensive environmental impact statement on implementation of the conservation measures ordered by NOAA Fisheries, including analysis of the measures directed by NOAA Fisheries and other reasonable alternatives. The court's opinion and its emphasis on a climate change-driven analysis element, if generalized to other situations, could require ESA-driven avoidance, minimization, and compensatory mitigation efforts to incorporate surplus measures to ensure species' protection, which could\nresult in considerable increases in cost beyond the cost of additional analysis in the NEPA process. In September 2016, federal agencies initiated an environmental impact statement process to examine hydroelectric dams on the lower Snake River, which Idaho Power expects will take place over a five-year period. None of Idaho Power's hydroelectric facilities are included in the studies.\nClimate Change and the Regulation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nOverview: Long-term climate change could significantly affect Idaho Power's business in a variety of ways, including:\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in temperature and precipitation could affect customer demand and energy loads;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>extreme weather events, wildfires, drought, and other natural phenomena and natural disasters could increase service interruptions, outages, maintenance costs, system damage, liability, and the need for additional backup systems, and can affect the supply of, and demand for, electricity and natural gas, which may impact the price of those and other commodities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in the amount and timing of snowpack and stream flows could affect hydroelectric generation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>legislative and/or regulatory developments related to climate change could affect plants and operations, including restrictions on the construction of new generation resources, the expansion of existing resources, or the operation of generation resources; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>consumer preference for, and resource planning decisions requiring, renewable or low GHG-emitting sources of energy could impact usage of existing generation sources and require significant investment in new generation and transmission infrastructure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFederal and state regulations pertaining to GHG emissions under the CAA have raised uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels, most notably coal, as an economical energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities because many new technologies for reducing CO2 emissions from coal, including carbon capture and storage, are still in the development stage and are not yet proven. Stringent emissions standards could result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs, which may accelerate the retirement of coal-fired units and create power system reliability issues. Some higher-cost, high-emission coal-fired plants have ceased operation or the plant owners have announced a near-term cessation of operation, as the cost of compliance makes the plants uneconomical to operate, particularly in light of continued low natural gas prices that decrease the cost to operate natural gas-fired power plants. As a result, Idaho Power plans to end its participation in coal-fired operations at the Valmy Plant units 1 and 2 in 2019 and 2025, respectively, and to cease coal-fired operations at the Boardman power plant no later than December 31, 2020.\nA variety of factors contribute to the financial, regulatory, and logistical uncertainties related to GHG reductions. These include the specific GHG emissions limits imposed, the timing of implementation of these limits, the level of emissions allowances allocated and the level that must be purchased, the purchase price of emissions allowances, the development and commercial availability of technologies for renewable energy and for the reduction of emissions, the degree to which offsets may be used for compliance, provisions for cost containment (if any), the impact on coal and natural gas prices, and the timing and amount of cost recovery through rates. Accordingly, Idaho Power cannot predict the effect on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of any GHG emission or other climate change requirements that may be adopted, although the costs to implement and comply with any such requirements could be substantial. A more detailed discussion of legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change follows.\nNational GHG Initiatives; Clean Power Plan: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been active in the regulation of GHGs. The EPA's endangerment finding in 2009 that GHGs threaten public health and welfare resulted in the enactment of a series of EPA regulations to address GHG emissions.\nIn May 2010, the EPA issued the Tailoring Rule,\u201d which set thresholds for GHG emissions that define when permits are required for new and existing industrial facilities. While the rule is complex, Idaho Power believes that its owned and co-owned fossil fuel-fired generation plants are, as of the date of this report, in compliance with the GHG Tailoring Rule.\nIn June 2014, the EPA released, under Section 111(d) of the CAA, a proposed rule for addressing GHG from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units (EGUs). The proposed rule was intended to achieve a 30 percent reduction in CO2 emissions from the power sector by 2030. In August 2015, the EPA released the final rule under Section 111(d) of the CAA, referred to as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), which required states to adopt plans to collectively reduce 2005 levels of power sector CO2 emissions by 32 percent by the year 2030. The final rule provided states until September 2018 to submit implementation plans, phasing in several compliance periods beginning in 2022 and achieving the final emissions goals by 2030. In August 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule to replace the CPP under Section 111(d) of the CAA for existing electric\nutility generating units. The new proposed rule is limited to reduction and compliance measures that occur at the physical location of each plant, removing the proposal to require reductions outside the boundaries of plants. The ACE rule also provides for more state-specific control over implementation of the rule to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, with a focus on state evaluation of improvement potential, technical feasibility, applicability, and remaining useful life of each unit. Because the rule is premised on state implementation plans, the terms of which Idaho Power does not control, and due to the existing and potential changes in legislation, regulation, and government policy with respect to environmental matters as a result of the presidential administration's executive orders and the EPA's proposal to repeal and replace the CPP discussed above, as of the date of this report and in light of these executive actions, Idaho Power is uncertain whether and to what extent the replacement CPP may impact its operations in the near term.\nState GHG Initiatives and Idaho Power's Voluntary GHG Reduction Initiative: In August 2007, the Oregon legislature enacted legislation setting goals of reducing GHG levels to 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and at least 75 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Oregon imposes GHG emission reporting requirements on facilities emitting 2,500 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalent annually. The Boardman coal-fired power plant located in Oregon, in which Idaho Power is a 10-percent owner, is subject to and in compliance with Oregon's GHG reporting requirements but is scheduled to cease coal-fired operations in 2020.\nIn Oregon, legislation referred to as the Oregon Clean Electricity and Coal Transition Plan was enacted in March 2016, and requires certain Oregon utilities to remove coal-fired generation from their Oregon retail rates by 2030. Oregon utilities would be permitted to sell the output of coal-fired plants into the wholesale market or reallocate such plants to other states. To the extent Idaho Power is subject to the legislation, it plans to seek recovery, through the ratemaking process, of operating and capitalized costs related to its coal-fired generation assets and removal of any of those assets from Oregon rate base.\nThe State of Idaho has not passed legislation specifically regulating GHGs. Wyoming and Nevada similarly have not enacted legislation to regulate GHG emissions and do not have a reporting requirement, but they are members of the Climate Registry, a national, voluntary GHG emission reporting system. The Climate Registry is a collaboration aimed at developing and managing a common GHG emission reporting system across states, provinces, and tribes to track GHG emissions nationally. All states for which Idaho Power has traditional fuel generating plants (i.e. Idaho, Oregon, Wyoming, and Nevada) are members of the Climate Registry. Idaho Power is engaged in voluntary GHG emissions intensity reduction efforts, which is discussed in Part I, Item 1 - Business - Utility Operations - Environmental Regulation and Costs.\"\nClean Air Act Matters\nOverview: In addition to the CAA developments related to GHG emissions described above, several other regulatory programs developed under the CAA apply to Idaho Power. These include the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), New Source Review / Prevention of Significant Deterioration Rules, and the Regional Haze Rule.\nMATS Implementation: The final MATS rule under the CAA, previously referred to as the Utility Maximum Achievable Control Technology Rule, was issued in February 2012. The final rule established emission limits for hazardous air pollutants from new and existing coal-fired and oil-fired steam electric generating units. The MATS rule provided that sources must be in compliance with emission limits by April 2015. Idaho Power and the plant co-owners have installed mercury continuous emission monitoring systems on all of the coal-fired units at the Jim Bridger, Boardman, and North Valmy coal-fired generating plants, along with control technology to reduce mercury, acid gases, and particulate matter emissions for purposes of compliance with the MATS rule. Idaho Power believes that as of the date of this report, the coal-fired plants are in compliance with the MATS rule. Legal challenges relating to the MATS rule, to which Idaho Power is not a party and pursuant to which the EPA is performing a court-mandated cost analysis for the rule, are pending. In August 2018, the EPA began reconsidering the justification behind the MATS rule and reviewing the regulations emissions standards. Idaho Power believes that as of the date of this report, its jointly-owned coal-fired plants are in compliance with the MATS rule, and does not expect the EPA's review of the MATS rule to have a significant impact on Idaho Power's operations or financial results.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards: The CAA requires the EPA to set ambient air quality standards for six \"criteria\" pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment. These six pollutants are carbon monoxide, lead, ozone, particulate matter, NO2, and SO2. States are then required to develop emission reduction strategies through State Implementation Plans, or SIPs, based on attainment of these ambient air quality standards. Recent developments and pending actions related to certain of those items relevant to Idaho Power include the following:\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NO2: In 2010, the EPA adopted a new NAAQS for NO2 at a level of 100 parts per billion averaged over a 1-hour\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nperiod. In connection with the new NAAQS, in February 2012 the EPA issued a final rule designating all of the counties in Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming where Idaho Power owns or has an interest in a natural gas or coal-fired power plant as unclassifiable/attainment\u201d for NO2. The EPA indicated it would review the designations after 2015, when three years of air quality monitoring data are available, and may formally designate the counties as attainment or non-attainment for NO2. A designation of non-attainment may increase the likelihood that Idaho Power would be required to install costly pollution control technology at one or more of its plants.\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>SO2: In 2010, the EPA adopted a new NAAQS for SO2 at a level of 75 parts per billion averaged over a one-hour period. In 2011, the states of Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming sent letters to the EPA recommending that all counties in these states be classified as \"unclassifiable\" under the new one-hour SO2 NAAQS because of a lack of definitive monitoring and modeling data. In February 2013, the EPA issued letters to the states of Idaho and Oregon, finding that the most recent air quality data for those states showed no violations of the 2010 SO2 standard. Since January 2018, the EPA has finalized designations of unclassifiable/attainment\u201d for SO2 for all areas in which Idaho Power owns or has an interest in a natural gas or coal-fired power plant.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Ozone: In late 2014, the EPA issued a proposed rule that would update the ozone standard under the CAA, from 75 parts per billion over an eight-hour period to 65 to 70 parts per billion over an eight-hour period. In October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the national ozone standard under the CAA to 70 parts per billion. The EPA stated that the vast majority of U.S. counties will meet the standards by 2025 with federal and state rules and programs now in place or underway. Since January 2018, the EPA has finalized designations for all of the counties in which Idaho Power owns or has an interest in a natural gas or coal-fired power plant and determined that they meet the standard.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of the date of this report and based on the EPA designations described above, Idaho Power does not expect these standards to significantly impact its operations or materially increase Idaho Power's capital and operating costs.\nRegional Haze Rules: In accordance with federal regional haze rules under the CAA, coal-fired utility boilers are subject to regional haze - best available retrofit technology (RH BART) if they were built between 1962 and 1977 and affect any \"Class I\" (wilderness) areas. This includes all four units at the Jim Bridger and the Boardman coal-fired plants. The RH BART rules would have required installation of a suite of emissions controls at the Boardman plant; however, in December 2010, the Oregon Environmental Quality Commission approved a plan to install a less costly suite of environmental controls and cease coal-fired operations at the Boardman power plant no later than December 31, 2020.\nIn December 2009, the WDEQ issued a RH BART permit to PacifiCorp as the operator of the Jim Bridger plant. As part of the WDEQ's long term strategy for regional haze, the permit required that PacifiCorp install SCR equipment for nitrogen oxide (NOx) control at Jim Bridger units 3 and 4 by December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016, respectively, which has been completed, and submit an application by December 31, 2017 to install add-on NOx controls at Jim Bridger unit 2 by 2021 and unit 1 by 2022, which was submitted in December 2017. Idaho Power is assessing whether to move forward with installation of SCR equipment at units 1 and 2. In November 2010, PacifiCorp and the WDEQ signed a settlement agreement under which PacifiCorp agreed to the timing and nature of the controls. The settlement agreement was conditioned on the EPA ultimately approving those portions of the Wyoming regional haze SIP that are consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement. In January 2014, the EPA approved Wyoming's regional haze SIP as to the Jim Bridger plant, with the NOx control compliance dates set forth in the settlement agreement. Several interested parties have appealed the EPA's decisions on Wyoming's regional haze SIP on various grounds. Idaho Power has not appealed the EPA's decisions but has intervened in the proceedings to participate if and to the extent the Jim Bridger plant could be affected.\nClean Water Act Matters\nDefinition of Waters of the United States\u201d Under the CWA: On August 28, 2015, the EPA's and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' final rule defining the phrase \"waters of the United States\" under the CWA became effective (WOTUS Rule). Idaho Power believes that the final rule potentially expanded federal jurisdiction under the CWA beyond traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, territorial seas, tributaries, and adjacent wetlands, to a number of other waters, including waters with a \"significant nexus\" to those traditional waters. The WOTUS Rule was widely challenged in both federal district and circuit courts. The State of Idaho, and several other parties, challenged the rule in North Dakota federal court. That court held that it had jurisdiction and enjoined the implementation of the WOTUS Rule. In February 2017, President Trump issued an executive order directing the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to rescind the WOTUS Rule. In July 2017, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a notice of their intent to rescind and replace the definition of \"waters of the United States\" under the CWA, which Idaho Power expects would reduce the number of waters in Idaho Power's service area subject to the WOTUS Rule. In November 2017, the EPA issued a notice that it will delay the effectiveness of the WOTUS Rule until 2020\nwhile the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers considers a replacement rule. In January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a unanimous ruling that challenges to the WOTUS Rule must begin with the federal district courts, effectively negating a nationwide stay issued by the Sixth Circuit in 2016. However, because the State of Idaho remains a party to the federal court action in North Dakota, that court's enjoinder remains in effect, meaning the WOTUS Rule currently does not apply to actions brought in Idaho. In July 2018, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a supplemental notice seeking additional comment on their 2017 proposal to repeal the definition of the term WOTUS Rule under the CWA. In August 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina issued a nationwide injunction on the EPA's suspension of the WOTUS Rule, resulting in the WOTUS Rule taking effect in twenty-two states and Washington D.C. The WOTUS Rule does not currently apply in twenty-eight states, including Idaho, and litigation over both the WOTUS Rule and the EPA's suspension of the WOTUS Rule continues. In December 2018, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed a rule to significantly limit the definition of \"waters of the United States\" under the CWA.\nIdaho Power has analyzed the WOTUS Rule and expects that, even if the WOTUS Rule is reinstated in Idaho, while it may cause Idaho Power to incur additional permitting, regulatory requirements, and other costs associated with the rule, the aggregate amount of increased costs is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on Idaho Power's operations or financial condition, in part due to the relatively arid climate of Idaho Power's service area. Similarly, because the CWA, as interpreted even prior to the WOTUS Rule, applies to most of Idaho Power's facilities, including its hydroelectric plants, Idaho Power does not expect this proposal to have a material benefit to Idaho Power's operations or financial condition.\nCWA Matters Related to Hydroelectric Relicensing: Idaho Power is also addressing CWA issues associated with the relicensing of its HCC. See Relicensing of Hydroelectric Projects\u201d in this MD&A for additional information on the impact of the CWA on that relicensing effort.\nReview of Federal Coal Leases\nIn January 2016, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior issued an order directing the BLM to prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) to analyze potential reforms to the federal coal lease program and placed a moratorium on new federal coal leasing, with limited exceptions, pending completion of the PEIS. In January 2017, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior ordered a cessation of all work on the PEIS and in March 2017 lifted the moratorium on new federal coal leases. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power believes that BCC has adequate reserves under existing leases to satisfy its coal delivery obligations to the Jim Bridger plant during the term of the existing coal supply contract through 2024, and that the Jim Bridger plant will otherwise have access to sufficient coal supplies for its operation for the foreseeable future. However, the lifting of the moratorium could increase the availability of BCC's coal resources and lower the cost of leases for those coal resources.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWhen preparing financial statements in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), IDACORP's and Idaho Power's management must apply accounting policies and make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates often involve judgment about factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management's control. Management adjusts these estimates based on historical experience and on other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual amounts could materially differ from the estimates. Management believes the accounting policies and estimates discussed below are the most critical to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.\nAccounting for Rate Regulation\nEntities that meet specific conditions are required by GAAP to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their consolidated financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until matching revenues can be recognized. Similarly, certain items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities. Idaho Power must satisfy three conditions to apply regulatory accounting: (1) an independent regulator must set rates; (2) the regulator must set the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service; and (3) the service area must lack competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator.\nIdaho Power has determined that it meets these conditions, and its financial statements reflect the effects of the different rate-making principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating Idaho Power. The primary effect of this policy is that Idaho Power had recorded approximately $1.2 billion of regulatory assets and $0.8 billion of regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2018.\nIdaho Power expects to recover these regulatory assets from customers through rates and refund these regulatory liabilities to customers through rates, but recovery or refund is subject to final review by the regulatory bodies. If future recovery or refund of these amounts ceases to be probable, or if Idaho Power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting, or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities, Idaho Power could be required to eliminate those regulatory assets or liabilities, which could have a material effect on Idaho Power's financial condition or results of operations.\nRefer to Note 3 - Regulatory Matters\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information relating to regulatory matters.\nIncome Taxes\nIDACORP and Idaho Power use judgment and estimation in developing the provision for income taxes and the reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws can involve uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret such laws differently. Actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts and may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income, cash flows, and tax-related assets and liabilities.\nIdaho Power records deferred income taxes related to its plant assets for the difference between income tax depreciation and book depreciation used for financial statement purposes. Deferred income taxes for other items are recorded for the temporary differences between the income tax and financial accounting treatment of such items. Unless contrary to applicable income tax guidance, deferred income taxes are not recorded for those income tax temporary differences where the prescribed regulatory accounting methods, or flow-through, direct Idaho Power to recognize the tax impacts currently for rate making and financial reporting.\nRefer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 2 - Income Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information relating to income taxes.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nIdaho Power maintains a tax-qualified, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees, and two unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain senior management employees and directors called the Security Plan for Senior Management Employees I and Security Plan for Senior Management Employees II (together, SMSP), and a postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits).\nThe costs IDACORP and Idaho Power record for these plans depend on the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, actual returns on plan assets, and several assumptions used in the actuarial valuations from which the expense is derived. The key actuarial assumptions that affect expense are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations. Management evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis, taking into account changes in market conditions, trends, and future expectations. Estimates of future capital markets performance, changes in interest rates, and other factors used to develop the actuarial assumptions are uncertain, and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates.\nThe assumed discount rate is based on reviews of market yields on high-quality corporate debt. Specifically, IDACORP and Idaho Power determined the discount rate for each plan through the construction of hypothetical portfolios of bonds selected from high-quality corporate bonds available as of December 31, 2018, with maturities matching the projected cash outflows of the plans. Based on the results of this analysis, the discount rate used to calculate the 2019 pension expense will be increased to 4.55 percent from the 3.95 percent used in 2018.\nRate-of-return projections for plan assets are based on historical risk/return relationships among asset classes. The primary measure is the historical risk premium each asset class has delivered versus the yield on the Moody's AA Corporate Bond Index. This historical risk premium is then added to the current yield on the Moody's AA Corporate Bond Index, and Idaho Power believes the result provides a reasonable prediction of future investment performance. Additional analysis is performed to measure the expected range of returns, as well as worst-case and best-case scenarios. Based on the current interest rate environment, current rate-of-return expectations are lower than the nominal returns generated over the past 20 years when interest rates were generally much higher. The long-term rate of return used to calculate the 2019 pension expense will be 7.5 percent, the same assumption as was used for 2018.\nGross net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost for these plans totaled $51.2 million, $50.4 million, and $51.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, including amounts deferred as regulatory assets (see discussion below) and amounts allocated to capitalized labor. For 2019, gross pension and other postretirement benefit costs are expected to total approximately $51.4 million, which takes into account the change in the discount rate noted above.\nHad different actuarial assumptions been used, pension expense could have varied significantly. The following table reflects the sensitivities associated with changes in the discount rate and rate-of-return on plan assets actuarial assumptions on historical and future pension and postretirement expense:\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate of return\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions of dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of 0.5% rate increase on net periodic benefit cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of 0.5% rate decrease on net periodic benefit cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally, a 0.5 percent increase in the plans' discount rates would have resulted in a $76.2 million decrease in the combined benefit obligations of the plans as of December 31, 2018. A 0.5 percent decrease in the plans' discount rates would have resulted in an $85.7 million increase in the combined benefit obligations of the plans as of December 31, 2018.\nThe IPUC has authorized Idaho Power to account for its defined benefit pension plan expense on a cash basis, and to defer and account for accrued pension expense as a regulatory asset. The IPUC acknowledged that it is appropriate for Idaho Power to seek recovery in its revenue requirement of reasonable and prudently incurred pension expense based on actual cash contributions. In 2007, Idaho Power began deferring pension expense to a regulatory asset account to be matched with revenue when future pension contributions are recovered through rates. At December 31, 2018, a total of $148 million of expense was deferred as a regulatory asset. Approximately $23 million is expected to be deferred in 2019. Idaho Power recorded pension expense on its consolidated statements of income related to its tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan of approximately $19 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nRefer to Note 12 - Benefit Plans\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information relating to pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a listing of new and recently adopted accounting standards, see Note 1 - \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to comprehend the table you've provided me with.\n- It seems to be missing some data\u2014can you provide me with the missing information?\n- I'm not sure what you're asking of me; could you please clarify your request?\n- I'm sorry, but I am unable to respond to your request.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) in this report, the general financial condition and results of operations for IDACORP and its subsidiaries and Idaho Power and its subsidiary are discussed. While reading the MD&A, please refer to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of IDACORP and Idaho Power. Also refer to \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and Part I - Item 1A - \"Risk Factors\" in this report for important information regarding forward-looking statements made in this MD&A and elsewhere in this report.\nINTRODUCTION\nIDACORP is a holding company whose principal operating subsidiary is Idaho Power. IDACORP's common stock is listed and trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol \"IDA\". Idaho Power is an electric utility whose rates and other matters are regulated by the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC), Public Utility Commission of Oregon (OPUC), and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Idaho Power generates revenues and cash flows primarily from the sale and distribution of electricity to customers in its Idaho and Oregon service areas, as well as from the wholesale sale and transmission of electricity.\nIdaho Power is the parent of Idaho Energy Resources Co. (IERCo), a joint venturer in Bridger Coal Company (BCC), which mines and supplies coal to the Jim Bridger generating plant owned in part by Idaho Power. IDACORP's other notable subsidiaries include IDACORP Financial Services, Inc. (IFS), an investor in affordable housing and other real estate investments; and Ida-West Energy Company, an operator of small hydroelectric generation projects that satisfy the requirements of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA).\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nIDACORP is committed to its focus on competitive total returns and generating long-term value for shareholders. IDACORP's business strategy emphasizes Idaho Power as IDACORP's core business, since Idaho Power's regulated electric utility operations are the primary driver of IDACORP's operating results. This strategy is described in Part I, Item 1 - \"Business - Business Strategy\" of this report. Examples of IDACORP's and Idaho Power's achievements and recognitions during 2018 include:\n \u2022 IDACORP achieved net income growth for an eleventh consecutive year; \n \u2022 IDACORP provided a 14 percent cumulative annual total shareholder return over the past three years, including share price appreciation and dividends paid, ranking in the 63rd percentile among peer companies in the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Electric Utilities Index; \n \u2022 IDACORP received its second EEI Electric Utilities Index award in the past three years, for the best total shareholder return performance among small cap utilities (market capitalization of less than $5 billion) over the past five years, measured as of September 30, 2018; \n \u2022 IDACORP increased its quarterly common stock dividend from $0.59 per share to $0.63 per share, as a part of a 110 percent increase in quarterly dividends approved over the last seven years under the company's objective to pay dividends at the upper end of the range of 50 percent to 60 percent of sustainable earnings; \n \u2022 Idaho Power's customer count grew 2.3 percent in 2018; \n \u2022 Idaho Power ranked second in J.D. Power's Electric Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study in its West Region Midsize segment for the second year in a row; \n \u2022 Idaho Power reached milestones on key transmission projects as the U.S. Forest Service issued a record of decision on the siting of the Boardman-to-Hemingway 500-kV project and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued a record of decision for the remaining transmission line segments of the Gateway West 500-kV transmission project; \n \u2022 Idaho Power achieved its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions intensity reduction goal; and \n \u2022 Idaho Power reached several constructive regulatory settlements that were approved by the IPUC and OPUC related to recent income tax reform, the indefinite extension, with modifications, of the current earnings support and revenue sharing mechanism, the prudence of certain Hells Canyon Complex (HCC) relicensing costs, and the treatment of costs incurred to join the energy imbalance market implemented in the western United States (Western EIM). \nSummary of 2018 Financial Results\nThe following is a summary of Idaho Power's net income, net income attributable to IDACORP, and IDACORP's earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 (in thousands, except earnings per share amounts):\n\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of net income attributable to IDACORP for the year ended December 31, 2018, from the year ended December 31, 2017 (items are in millions and are before tax unless otherwise noted):\n\nIDACORP's net income increased $14.4 million for 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to higher net income at Idaho Power. Customer growth added $10.3 million to Idaho Power's operating income compared with 2017. Sales volumes on a per-customer basis decreased operating income by $9.4 million in 2018 compared with 2017. A decrease in sales volumes to residential customers was partially offset by an increase in usage per irrigation customer. Milder temperatures in 2018 compared with 2017 caused residential customers to use 6 percent less electricity per customer, mostly for cooling and heating purposes, while decreased precipitation led agricultural irrigation customers to use 9 percent more electricity per customer to operate irrigation pumps. However, due mostly to the lower usage by Idaho residential customers, the FCA mechanism added $17.7 million to operating income during 2018 compared with 2017.\nThe net decrease in retail revenues per MWh reduced operating income by $26.9 million in 2018 compared with 2017. The settlement stipulations approved by the IPUC and OPUC during the second quarter of 2018 relating to recent income tax reform reduced revenues by approximately $22 million in 2018. The timing of the revenue reductions may not align with decreases in income tax expense in any given period due to the method and timing of customer rate reductions provided for in the settlement\nstipulations, the nature and timing of income tax accruals, discrete items, and other items discussed in more detail in the \"Income Tax Reform\" section below. Also, a change in customer sales mix reduced the retail revenues per MWh as volumes sold to residential customers made up a smaller portion of the customer sales mix.\nDuring 2018, Idaho Power benefited from a $16.1 million increase in transmission wheeling and other revenues, compared with 2017. This change was largely due to a 37 percent increase in the Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) rate in October 2017, partially offset by a 10 percent decrease in the OATT rate in October 2018 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in wheeling volumes.\nOther O&M expenses included $4.0 million of non-cash amortization expense of regulatory deferrals that would otherwise be a future liability of Idaho customers, as provided by the settlement stipulation approved by the IPUC related to income tax reform. Excluding the non-cash amortization of regulatory deferrals, other O&M expenses were $13.8 million higher in 2018 compared with 2017. In 2018, compared with 2017, higher maintenance service costs led to a $4.2 million increase in transmission and distribution asset maintenance expenses, and higher variable employee-related costs led to an $8.4 million increase in labor and benefit expenses.\nIn 2018, Idaho Power recorded $5.0 million as a provision against current revenues to be refunded to customers through a future rate reduction, through the Idaho-jurisdiction power cost adjustment (PCA) mechanism pursuant to a settlement stipulation with the IPUC as described in \"Regulation of Rates and Cost Recovery\" below.\nIdaho Power's $5.7 million remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from the federal and Idaho income tax rate change (discussed in further detail below) on the adjustment of temporary differences as a result of IDACORP's 2017 consolidated income tax return filings and the $1.3 million flow-through benefit of a tax deductible make-whole premium that Idaho Power paid in connection with the early redemption of long-term debt in April 2018 decreased Idaho Power's income tax expense by $7.0 million in 2018. Idaho Power recorded $2.0 million of income tax expense in 2017 for the initial remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from the federal and Idaho income tax rate change. Excluding these items, Idaho Power income tax expense was $23.9 million lower during 2018 compared with 2017, due mostly to the lower federal and state statutory income tax rates resulting from income tax reform.\n2018 Initiatives and Strategy\nIDACORP's strategy is focused on four areas: growing to enhance financial strength, improving Idaho Power's core business, enhancing Idaho Power's brand, and focusing on safety and employee engagement. IDACORP's board of directors has reviewed and affirmed IDACORP's long-term strategy. In executing on these four strategic focus areas, IDACORP seeks to balance the interests of shareowners, Idaho Power customers, employees, and other stakeholders. Idaho Power is working to continue to provide safe, fair-priced, reliable service to its customers from a diversified source of generation resources, with a continued commitment to strong, sustainable financial results. For more information on the business strategy of the companies, see Part I, Item 1 - Business - Business Strategy\u201d in this report.\nOverview of General Factors and Trends Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition are affected by a number of factors, and the impact of those factors is discussed in more detail below in this MD&A. To provide context for the discussion elsewhere in this report, some of the more notable factors include the following:\n \u2022 Regulation of Rates and Cost Recovery: The price that Idaho Power is authorized to charge for its electric and transmission service is a critical factor in determining IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. Those rates are established by state regulatory commissions and the FERC and are intended to allow Idaho Power an opportunity to recover its expenses and earn a reasonable return on investment. Idaho Power focuses on timely recovery of its costs through filings with its regulators, working to put in place innovative regulatory mechanisms, and on the prudent management of expenses and investments. Idaho Power has regulatory settlement stipulations in Idaho that include provisions for the accelerated amortization of certain tax credits to help achieve a minimum 9.5 percent (9.4 percent after 2019) return on year-end equity in the Idaho jurisdiction (Idaho ROE). The settlement stipulations also provide for the potential sharing between Idaho Power and customers of Idaho-jurisdictional earnings in excess of specified levels of Idaho ROE. The settlement stipulations provide for modifications of certain terms and the indefinite extension of the mechanism beyond the original termination date of December 31, 2019. The specific terms of these settlement stipulations are described in \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A and in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. During \n2019, Idaho Power will continue to assess the need to file a general rate case to reset base rates, but does not anticipate filing a rate case in the next twelve months.\n \u2022 Income Tax Reform: In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, which lowered the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and modified or eliminated certain federal income tax deductions for corporations (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). The majority of the changes, including the rate reduction, became effective on January 1, 2018. In March 2018, Idaho House Bill 463 was signed into law reducing the Idaho state corporate income tax rate from 7.4 percent to 6.925 percent. In May 2018, the IPUC issued an order approving a settlement stipulation related to these changes in income taxes (May 2018 Idaho Tax Reform Settlement Stipulation). Beginning June 1, 2018, the settlement stipulation provided an annual (a) $18.7 million reduction to Idaho customer base rates and (b) $7.4 million for the amortization of regulatory deferrals that would otherwise be a future liability recoverable from Idaho customers. Additionally, a one-time benefit of a $7.8 million rate reduction is being provided to Idaho customers through the PCA mechanism during the period from June 2018 through May 2019, for the income tax reform benefits accrued from January 2018 to May 2018 and for amounts included in Idaho Power's transmission revenues. The May 2018 Idaho Tax Reform Settlement Stipulation was designed to return to Idaho customers their share of the estimated annual pro forma tax expense reductions resulting from income tax reform, based on the full-year 2017 as required by the IPUC. Idaho Power's financial results from 2018 forward will be affected by any differences between annual income tax expense and the pro forma 2017 income tax expense used in the settlement until incorporated into a future rate proceeding or rate case. Refer to \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A for more information on the related regulatory proceedings. \n \u2022 Economic Conditions and Loads: Economic conditions impact consumer demand for energy, revenues, collectability of accounts, the volume of wholesale energy sales, and the need to construct and improve infrastructure, purchase power, and implement programs to meet customer load demands. In recent years, Idaho Power has seen growth in the number of customers in its service area. In 2018, Idaho Power's customer count grew by 2.3 percent, and employment in Idaho Power's service area grew by approximately 2.2 percent based on Idaho Department of Labor preliminary December 2018 data. Idaho Power expects its number of customers to continue to increase in the foreseeable future. Idaho Power has in recent years supported State of Idaho-coordinated efforts to promote economic development with an emphasis on attracting industrial and commercial customers to its service area. \nIn August 2018, Idaho Power began preparing its 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), Idaho Power's long-term forecast of loads and resources. For more information on the 2019 IRP, including the preliminary load forecast assumptions Idaho Power expects to use in its 2019 IRP, refer to \"Resource Planning\" in Item 1 - \"Business\" in this Form 10-K.\n \u2022 Weather Conditions: Weather and agricultural growing conditions have a significant impact on Idaho Power's energy sales. Relatively low and high temperatures result in greater energy use for heating and cooling, respectively. During the agricultural growing season, which in large part occurs during the second and third quarters, irrigation customers use electricity to operate irrigation pumps, and weather conditions can impact the timing and extent of use of those pumps. Idaho Power also has tiered rates and seasonal rates, which contribute to increased revenues during higher-load periods, most notably during the third quarter of each year, when overall customer demand is highest. Much of the adverse or favorable impact of weather on sales of energy to Idaho residential and small commercial customers is mitigated through the FCA mechanism, which is described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements in this report. \nFurther, as Idaho Power's hydroelectric facilities comprise approximately one-half of Idaho Power's nameplate generation capacity, precipitation levels impact the mix of Idaho Power's generation resources. When hydroelectric generation is reduced, Idaho Power must rely on more expensive generation sources and purchased power. When favorable hydroelectric generating conditions exist for Idaho Power, they also may exist for other Pacific Northwest hydroelectric facility operators, lowering regional wholesale market prices and impacting the revenue Idaho Power receives from wholesale energy sales of its excess power. Much of the adverse or favorable impact of this volatility is addressed through the Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms.\n \u2022 Rate Base Growth and Infrastructure Investment: As noted above, the rates established by the IPUC and OPUC are determined with the intent to provide an opportunity for Idaho Power to recover authorized operating expenses and earn a reasonable return on rate base.\u201d Rate base is generally determined by reference to the original cost (net of accumulated depreciation) of utility plant in service and certain other assets, subject to various adjustments for deferred taxes and other items. Over time, rate base is increased by additions to utility plant in service and reduced by depreciation and retirement of utility plant and write-offs as authorized by the IPUC and OPUC. In recent years, Idaho \nPower has been pursuing significant enhancements to its utility infrastructure in an effort to maintain system reliability, ensure an adequate supply of electricity, and to provide service to new customers, including major ongoing transmission projects such as the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West projects. Idaho Power's existing hydroelectric and thermal generation facilities also require continuing upgrades and equipment replacement, and the company is undertaking a significant relicensing effort for the HCC, its largest hydroelectric generation resource. Idaho Power intends to pursue timely inclusion of any significant completed capital projects into rate base as part of a future general rate case or other appropriate regulatory proceeding.\n \u2022 Mitigation of Impact of Fuel and Purchased Power Expense: In addition to hydroelectric generation, Idaho Power relies heavily on natural gas and coal to fuel its generation facilities and power purchases in the wholesale markets. Fuel costs are impacted by electricity sales volumes, the terms and conditions of contracts for fuel, Idaho Power's generation capacity, the availability of hydroelectric generation resources, transmission capacity, energy market prices, and Idaho Power's hedging program for managing fuel costs. Recently, low natural gas prices have made operation of Idaho Power's natural gas power plants more economical, resulting in increased operation of those plants and decreased operation of coal-fired plants. Purchased power costs are impacted by the terms and conditions of contracts for purchased power, the rate of expansion of alternative energy generation sources such as wind or solar energy, and wholesale energy market prices. The Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms mitigate in large part the potential adverse impacts of fluctuations in power supply costs to Idaho Power. \n \u2022 Regulatory and Environmental Compliance Costs: Idaho Power is subject to extensive federal and state laws, policies, and regulations, as well as regulatory actions and audits by agencies and quasi-governmental agencies, including the FERC, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Compliance with these requirements directly influences Idaho Power's operating environment and affects Idaho Power's operating costs. Recently, energy industry regulators have issued substantial penalties for utilities alleged to have violated reliability and critical infrastructure protection requirements. Moreover, environmental laws and regulations, in particular, may increase the cost of operating generation plants, including Idaho Power's coal-fired plants, and constructing new facilities, require that Idaho Power install additional pollution control devices at existing generating plants, or require that Idaho Power cease operating certain generation plants. Idaho Power expects to spend a considerable amount on environmental compliance and controls in the next decade, and due to economic factors in part associated with the costs of compliance with environmental regulation, has accelerated the retirement dates of certain of its coal-fired power plants. \n \u2022 Water Management and Relicensing of the Hells Canyon Hydroelectric Project: Because of Idaho Power's reliance on stream flow in the Snake River and its tributaries, Idaho Power participates in numerous proceedings and venues that may affect its water rights, seeking to preserve the long-term availability of its rights for its hydroelectric projects. Also, Idaho Power is involved in renewing its long-term federal license for the HCC, its largest hydroelectric generation source. Given the number of parties and issues involved, Idaho Power's relicensing costs have been and are expected to continue to be substantial. Idaho Power cannot currently determine the terms of, and costs associated with, any resulting long-term license. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section of MD&A takes a closer look at the significant factors that affected IDACORP's and Idaho Power's earnings. In this analysis, the results for 2018 are compared with 2017 and the results for 2017 are compared with 2016.\nThe table below presents Idaho Power's energy sales and supply (in thousands of MWh) for the last three years.\n\nFor purposes of illustration, Boise, Idaho, weather-related information for the last three years is presented in the table that follows.\n\n(1) Heating and cooling degree-days are common measures used in the utility industry to analyze the demand for electricity and indicate when a customer would use electricity for heating and air conditioning. A degree-day measures how much the average daily temperature varies from 65 degrees. Each degree above 65 degrees is counted as one cooling degree-day, and each degree below 65 degrees is counted as one heating degree-day. While Boise, Idaho weather conditions are not necessarily representative of weather conditions throughout Idaho Power's service area, the greater Boise area has the majority of Idaho Power's customers.\n(2) Normal heating degree-days and cooling degree-days elements are, by convention, the arithmetic mean of the elements computed over 30 consecutive years. The annual normal amounts are the sum of the 12 monthly normal amounts. These normal amounts are computed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nSales Volume and Generation: In 2018, retail sales volumes were relatively flat compared with those of the prior year. Customer growth increased sales volumes during 2018 compared with 2017, with the number of Idaho Power's customers growing by 2.3 percent. During 2018, usage per irrigation customer was approximately 9 percent higher compared with 2017. Precipitation in the Idaho Power service area during 2018 was significantly less than in 2017, which increased usage by irrigation customers in 2018. Usage per residential customer was approximately 6 percent lower in 2018 compared with 2017. The decrease in residential usage was primarily due to milder weather during 2018 compared with 2017, which decreased the use of electricity for heating and cooling purposes. Cooling degree-days in Boise, Idaho were 17 percent lower during 2018 compared with 2017, but 18 percent above normal. Heating degree-days in Boise, Idaho were 12 percent lower during 2018 compared with 2017, and 10 percent below normal. Also, bundled energy sales (electric power combined with renewable energy certificates) volumes increased during 2018 compared with 2017. The solar generation projects under PURPA contracts that were initiated in 2017 generated an increased number of renewable energy credits to sell bundled with electricity.\nTotal system generation decreased 2 percent during 2018 compared with 2017. Hydroelectric generation decreased 2 percent during 2018 compared with 2017, but comprised 65 percent of Idaho Power's total system generation during both 2018 and 2017. In 2018, purchased power increased 28 percent compared with 2017 due to an increase in power purchased from generation projects under mandatory PURPA contracts and an increase in other purchased power resulting from favorable wholesale gas and electricity market conditions and, to a lesser extent, transactions in the Western EIM, which commenced in\nApril 2018. The availability of hydroelectric generation and an increase in purchased power during 2018 reduced thermal generation compared with 2017.\nWholesale energy sales volumes increased 312 thousand MWh, or 16 percent, during 2018 compared with 2017, due primarily to an increase in purchased power, both in market purchases and in purchases under PURPA contracts, resulting in increased energy available for wholesale energy sales. However, the high purchase price of power under federally mandated PURPA purchases is often in excess of the price at which Idaho Power sells the power in the wholesale energy markets.\nThe financial impacts of fluctuations in wholesale energy sales, purchased power, fuel expense, and other power supply-related expenses are addressed in Idaho Power's Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms, which are described below in \"Power Cost Adjustment Mechanisms.\"\nOperating Revenues\nRetail Revenues: The table below presents Idaho Power's retail revenues (in thousands), MWh sales (in thousands), and number of customers for the last three years.\n\n(1) The FCA mechanism is an alternative revenue program and does not represent revenue from contracts with customers.\n(2) As part of its January 30, 2009, general rate case order, the IPUC is allowing Idaho Power to recover a portion of the allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) on construction work in progress related to the HCC relicensing process, even though the relicensing process is not yet complete and the costs have not been moved to electric plant in service. Idaho Power is collecting approximately $8.8 million annually in the Idaho jurisdiction but is deferring revenue recognition of the amounts collected until the license is issued and the accumulated license costs approved for recovery are placed in service. Prior to the May 2018 Idaho Tax Reform Settlement Stipulation described in \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A, Idaho Power was collecting $10.7 million annually.\nChanges in rates, changes in customer demand, and changes in FCA mechanism revenues are the primary reasons for fluctuations in retail revenues from period to period. See \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A for a list of rate changes implemented over the last three years. The primary influences on customer demand for electricity are weather, economic conditions, and energy efficiency. Extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating, while mild temperatures decrease sales. Precipitation levels and the timing of precipitation during the agricultural growing season also affect sales to customers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps. Rates are also seasonally adjusted, providing for higher rates during summer peak load periods, and residential customer rates are tiered, providing for higher rates\nbased on higher levels of usage. The seasonal and tiered rate structures contribute to seasonal fluctuations in revenues and earnings.\nRetail Revenues - 2018 Compared with 2017: Retail revenues decreased $30.8 million in 2018 compared with 2017. The primary factors affecting retail revenues during the period were the following:\n \u2022 Rates: Rate changes decreased retail revenues by $39.0 million in 2018 compared with 2017. As a direct result of settlement stipulations approved by the IPUC and OPUC during the second quarter of 2018 relating to income tax reform described further in \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A, Idaho Power's revenues decreased approximately $22 million in 2018 compared with 2017. The timing of the revenue reductions may not align with decreases in income tax expense in any given period due to the method and timing of customer rate reductions provided for in the settlement stipulations, the nature and timing of income tax accruals, discrete items, and other items discussed in this MD&A. The rates include collection of amounts related to the PCA mechanism, which decreased revenues by $15.4 million in 2018 compared with 2017. The collection of amounts related to the PCA mechanism in rates has no effect on operating income as a corresponding amount is recorded as expense in the same period it is collected through rates. \n \u2022 Customers: Customer growth of 2.3 percent increased retail revenues by $13.5 million in 2018 compared with 2017. \n \u2022 Usage: Lower usage (on a per customer basis), primarily by residential customers, decreased retail revenues by $18.0 million during 2018 compared with 2017. Decreased usage was primarily the result of more mild temperatures in Idaho Power's service area during 2018 compared with 2017, which led to decreased usage by residential customers for heating and cooling. For 2018, a 6 percent decrease in usage per residential customer compared with 2017 was partially offset by a 9 percent increase in usage per irrigation customer. Precipitation in Idaho Power's service area during 2018 was significantly less than 2017, which led to increased usage by irrigation customers. \n \u2022 Idaho FCA Revenue: The FCA mechanism, applicable to Idaho residential and small commercial customers, adjusts revenue each year to accrue, or defer, the difference between the authorized fixed-cost recovery amount per customer and the actual fixed costs per customer recovered by Idaho Power through volume-based rates during the year. Lower usage (on a per customer basis) by residential and small general service customers during 2018 increased the amount of FCA revenue accrued by $17.7 million compared with 2017. \n \u2022 Sharing: During 2018, Idaho Power recorded $5.0 million as a provision against current revenues to be refunded to customers through a future rate reduction. If approved, the rate reduction would be included in PCA rates beginning in June 2019. Idaho Power did not record any provision for sharing in 2017. This revenue sharing arrangement, which requires Idaho Power to share with Idaho customers a portion of Idaho-jurisdiction earnings exceeding a 10.0 percent Idaho ROE, is related to the October 2014 Idaho Earnings Support and Sharing Settlement Stipulation. The October 2014 Idaho Earnings Support and Sharing Settlement Stipulation is described further in \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A and in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. \nRetail Revenues - 2017 Compared with 2016: Retail revenues increased $60.0 million in 2017 compared with 2016. The factors affecting retail revenues during the period are discussed below:\n \u2022 Rates: Rate changes, including the revenue accruals provided for in the Valmy settlement stipulation, increased retail revenues by $39.8 million for 2017 compared with 2016. In the second quarter of 2017, the IPUC and OPUC each approved settlement stipulations related to Idaho Power's plan to end its participation in coal-fired operations at the Valmy Plant by the end of 2025, which increased retail revenues collections and retail revenues accruals for 2017 compared with 2016. Colder winter temperatures in early 2017 and warmer summer temperatures during the third quarter of 2017 resulted in residential sales making up a larger portion of the sales mix and led to a greater proportion of residential sales in higher rate categories in Idaho Power's tiered rate structure in 2017 compared with 2016. \n \u2022 Customers: Customer growth of 2.0 percent increased retail revenues by $12.1 million in 2017 compared with 2016. \n \u2022 Usage: Higher usage (on a per customer basis), primarily by residential, industrial, and commercial customers increased retail revenues by $20.1 million in 2017 compared with 2016. Increased usage was primarily the result of warmer summer temperatures and colder winter temperatures in Idaho Power's service area, which increased usage by residential customers for cooling and heating. Cooling degree days and heating degree days were significantly higher in 2017 compared with 2016. These increases in usage were partially offset by an 11 percent decrease in usage per irrigation customer due to increased precipitation in Idaho Power's service area during 2017 compared with 2016, \nparticularly in the first six months of 2017. Greater customer participation in energy efficiency programs, resulting in decreased usage, partially offset the increase in total usage during 2017 compared with 2016.\n \u2022 Idaho FCA Revenue: The FCA mechanism, applicable to Idaho residential and small commercial customers, adjusts revenue each year to accrue, or defer, the difference between the authorized fixed-cost recovery amount per customer and the actual fixed costs per customer recovered by Idaho Power through volume-based rates during the year. Higher usage (on a per customer basis) by residential and small general service customers during 2017 decreased the amount of FCA revenue accrued by $12.1 million compared with 2016. Idaho Power accrued $18.2 million of FCA revenue in 2017 compared with $30.3 million of FCA revenue in 2016. \nWholesale Energy Sales: Wholesale energy sales consist primarily of long-term sales contracts, opportunity sales of surplus system energy, and sales into the Western EIM, and do not include derivative transactions. The table below presents Idaho Power's wholesale energy sales for the last three years (in thousands, except for MWh amounts).\n\nWholesale Energy Sales - 2018 Compared with 2017: In 2018, wholesale energy revenue increased by $28.1 million, or 113 percent, compared with 2017. Wholesale energy sales volumes increased 16 percent in 2018 compared with 2017, and the average price of wholesale energy sales was 84 percent higher for 2018 compared with 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2018, a natural gas pipeline ruptured in British Columbia, Canada, disrupting natural gas flows to the Pacific Northwest and Western Canada, driving up energy and natural gas prices in the region, including in Idaho Power's service area. An increase in purchased power, both in market purchases and in purchases under PURPA contracts, resulted in additional energy available for wholesale energy sales in 2018 compared with 2017. However, the high purchase price of power under federally mandated PURPA purchases is often in excess of the price at which Idaho Power sells the power in the wholesale energy markets. The increase in wholesale energy sales volumes and sales prices during 2018 compared with 2017 was also due to transactions in the Western EIM, which commenced in April 2018. Under the Western EIM, participating parties enable their systems to interact for automated intra-hour economic dispatch of generation from committed resources to serve loads.\nWholesale Energy Sales - 2017 Compared with 2016: For 2017, wholesale energy sales revenue increased by $12.9 million, or 108 percent compared with 2016 as generation from Idaho Power's hydroelectric plants increased due to significantly greater precipitation in 2017 compared with 2016. The increase in hydroelectric generation resulted in more energy available for wholesale energy sales in 2017 compared with 2016. The average price of wholesale energy sales was 20 percent lower for 2017 compared with 2016, as an increase in output from hydroelectric resources in the northwest United States region due to increased precipitation during the period, as well as additional output from new wind and solar projects throughout the region, increased surplus power available for sale and decreased wholesale power market prices.\nTransmission Wheeling Revenues: Revenue from transmission wheeling increased $15.1 million, or 34 percent, in 2018 compared with 2017, largely due to Idaho Power's OATT rate that increased in October 2017 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in wheeling volumes. In October 2017, Idaho Power's OATT rate increased from $25.52 per kW-year to $34.90 per kW-year. In October 2018, the rate decreased to $31.25 per kW-year. Refer to \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A for more information on Idaho Power's OATT rate. Revenue from transmission wheeling increased $11.5 million, or 35 percent, in 2017 compared with 2016, largely due to an increase in wheeling volumes, an increase in Idaho Power's OATT rate, and a new long-term wheeling agreement that became effective in July 2016.\nEnergy Efficiency Program Revenues: In both Idaho and Oregon, energy efficiency riders fund energy efficiency program expenditures. Expenditures funded through the riders are reported as an operating expense with an equal amount recorded in revenues, resulting in no net impact on earnings. The cumulative variances between expenditures and amounts collected through the riders are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. A liability balance indicates that Idaho Power has collected more than it has spent and an asset balance indicates that Idaho Power has spent more than it has collected. At December 31, 2018, Idaho Power's energy efficiency rider balances were a $5.3 million regulatory liability in the Idaho jurisdiction and a $1.4 million regulatory asset in the Oregon jurisdiction.\nOperating Expenses\nPurchased Power: The table below presents Idaho Power's purchased power expenses and volumes for the last three years (in thousands, except for MWh amounts).\n\nIdaho Power is required by federal law to purchase power from some PURPA generation projects at a specified price regardless of the then-current load demand or wholesale energy market prices. The intermittent, non-dispatchable nature of most PURPA generation increases the likelihood that Idaho Power will at times be required to reduce output from its lower-cost hydroelectric and fossil fuel-fired generation resources and may be required to sell its excess power in the wholesale power market at a significant loss. The other purchased power cost per MWh often exceeds the wholesale energy sales revenue per MWh because Idaho Power generally needs to purchase more power during heavy load periods than during light load periods, and conversely has less energy available for wholesale energy sales during heavy load periods than light load periods. Market energy prices are typically higher during heavy load periods than during light load periods. Also, in accordance with Idaho Power's risk management policy, Idaho Power may purchase or sell energy several months in advance of anticipated delivery. The regional energy market price is dynamic and additional energy transactions that Idaho Power makes at current market prices may be noticeably different than the advance transaction prices. Most of the non-PURPA purchased power and substantially all of the PURPA power purchase costs are recovered through base rates and Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms.\nPurchased Power - 2018 Compared with 2017: Purchased power expense increased $44.9 million, or 18 percent, in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to a 65 percent increase in the volume of other non-PURPA power purchases and a 9 percent increase in the volume of power purchases from generation projects under PURPA contracts. Other purchased power volumes increased during 2018 compared with 2017 due to wholesale gas and electricity market conditions and due to transactions in the Western EIM, which commenced in April 2018. These volume increases were partially offset by decreases in cost per MWh of power purchased from sources other than PURPA contracts.\nPurchased Power - 2017 Compared with 2016: Purchased power expense increased $3.2 million, or 1 percent, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to an increase in generation provided by PURPA solar contracts. The increase in PURPA volumes was partially offset by decreases in costs per MWh. Other purchased power expense decreased $12.9 million, or 14 percent, as abundant hydroelectric generation in 2017 compared with 2016 reduced the need for market purchases to meet load requirements.\nFuel Expense: The table below presents Idaho Power's fuel expenses and thermal generation for the last three years (in thousands, except per MWh amounts).\n\n(1) Includes a negligible amount of expense and generation related to the Salmon diesel-fired generation plant.\nThe majority of the fuel for Idaho Power's jointly-owned coal-fired plants is purchased through long-term contracts, including purchases from BCC, a one-third owned joint venture of IERCo. The price of coal from BCC is subject to fluctuations in mine operating expenses, geologic conditions, and production levels. BCC supplies up to two-thirds of the coal used by the Jim Bridger plant. Natural gas is mainly purchased on the regional wholesale spot market at published index prices. In addition to commodity (variable) costs, both natural gas and coal expenses include costs that are more fixed in nature for items such as capacity charges, transportation, and fuel handling. Period to period variances in fuel expense per MWh are noticeably impacted by these fixed charges when generation output is substantially different between the periods.\nFuel Expense - 2018 Compared with 2017: Fuel expense decreased $12.6 million, or 9 percent, in 2018 compared with 2017. In October 2018, a natural gas pipeline ruptured in British Columbia, Canada, which disrupted natural gas distribution to the Pacific Northwest region and Western Canada, and drove up energy prices in the region. In accordance with its ongoing risk management policies, Idaho Power held a number of financial gas hedges at the time of the rupture. Fuel expense in the fourth quarter of 2018 included $23.3 million in gains on financial gas hedges, which reduced natural gas fuel expense. Idaho Power was able to meet natural gas needs by purchasing physical gas from sources unaffected by the rupture. Most of these realized hedging gains will be a benefit to customers through the power cost adjustment mechanisms described below.\nFuel Expense - 2017 Compared with 2016: Fuel expense decreased $33.7 million, or 19 percent, in 2017 compared with 2016, due primarily to increased output from Idaho Power's hydroelectric plants, which reduced utilization of gas and coal generation. Generation from the hydroelectric plants increased 39 percent during 2017 compared with 2016.\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanisms: Idaho Power's power supply costs (primarily purchased power and fuel expense, less wholesale energy sales) can vary significantly from year to year. Volatility of power supply costs arises from factors such as weather conditions, wholesale market prices, volumes of power purchased and sold in the wholesale markets, Idaho Power's hydroelectric and thermal generation volumes and fuel costs, generation plant availability, and retail loads. To address the volatility of power supply costs, Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms in the Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions allow Idaho Power to recover from customers, or refund to customers, most of the fluctuations in power supply costs. In the Idaho jurisdiction, the PCA includes a cost or benefit sharing ratio that allocates the deviations in net power supply expenses between customers (95 percent) and Idaho Power (5 percent), with the exception of PURPA power purchases and demand response program incentives, which are allocated 100 percent to customers. The Idaho deferral period, or PCA year, runs from April 1 through March 31. Amounts deferred during the PCA year are primarily recovered or refunded during the subsequent June 1 through May 31 period. Because of the power cost adjustment mechanisms, the primary financial impacts of power supply cost variations is that cash is paid out but recovery from customers does not occur until a future period, or cash that is collected is refunded to customers in a future period, resulting in fluctuations in operating cash flows from year to year.\nThe table below presents the components of the Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms for the last three years (in thousands).\n\nThe power supply accruals represent the portion of the power supply cost fluctuations accrued under the power cost adjustment mechanisms. When actual power supply costs are lower than the amount forecasted in power cost adjustment rates, which was the case for 2018 and 2017, most of the difference is accrued. When actual power supply costs are higher than the amount forecasted in power cost adjustment rates, which was the case for 2016, most of the difference is deferred. The amortization of the prior year's balances represents the offset to the amounts being collected or refunded in the current power cost adjustment year that were deferred or accrued in the prior power cost adjustment year (the true-up component of the power cost adjustment mechanism).\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanisms - 2018 Compared with 2017: Actual net power supply costs decreased in 2018 relative to forecasted costs, resulting in a change of $26.9 million-from accruals of $14.7 million to accruals of $41.5 million. The increase in accruals is due in part to lower natural gas fuel costs and purchased power, as explained above, combined with more surplus sales than forecasted. In addition, Idaho Power recorded $0.6 million of amortization of the prior-year authorized balances in 2018, compared with $37.4 million of amortization in 2017.\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanisms - 2017 Compared with 2016: Actual net power supply costs decreased in 2017 relative to forecasted costs, resulting in a change of $58.5 million-from deferrals of $43.8 million to accruals of $14.7 million. The change from deferrals in 2016 to accruals in 2017 is due in part to the lower fuel costs and purchased power, combined with more surplus sales than forecasted. The $37.4 million of amortization of prior year authorized balances in 2017 offsets the collection from customers of prior years' deferrals.\nOther Operations and Maintenance Expenses: The changes in other O&M expenses for the periods presented are discussed below.\nO&M - 2018 Compared with 2017: Other O&M expenses increased $17.8 million, or 5 percent, in 2018 compared with 2017. As provided by the settlement stipulation approved by the IPUC related to recent income tax reform, other O&M expenses in 2018 also included $4.0 million of non-cash amortization expense of regulatory deferrals that would otherwise be a future liability of Idaho customers. In 2018, compared with 2017, higher maintenance service costs led to a $4.2 million increase in transmission and distribution asset maintenance expenses, and higher variable employee-related costs led to an $8.4 million increase in labor and benefit expenses.\nO&M - 2017 Compared with 2016: Other O&M expense decreased by $2.2 million in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to a $2.4 million decrease related to previously expensed energy efficiency rider-funded costs deemed to be prudently incurred and a $2.7 million decrease in thermal O&M expenses due to lower generation at thermal plants. These decreases in O&M were partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in O&M related to a settlement stipulation in Idaho that established the reasonableness of the HCC relicensing costs incurred through December 2015 as further discussed in \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A.\nIncome Taxes\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's 2018 income tax expense decreased $31.3 million and $33.0 million, respectively, when\ncompared with 2017. The decrease was primarily due to: (1) the Tax Cut and Jobs Act's reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent that became effective January 1, 2018, (2) the remeasurement of deferred income tax balances related to IDACORP's 2017 consolidated income tax return filings, and (3) a flow-through income tax benefit at Idaho Power related to the tax deduction for a bond make-whole premium that was paid in 2018.\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's 2017 income tax expense increased $12.2 million and $14.1 million, respectively, when\ncompared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings at Idaho Power in 2017, and the $5.6 million\nflow-through benefit of a tax deductible make-whole premium that Idaho Power paid in connection with the early redemption of long-term debt in 2016. There were no early redemptions of long-term debt in 2017. These increases in income tax expense\nwere partially offset by greater net flow-through income tax items at Idaho Power.\nFor additional information relating to IDACORP's and Idaho Power's income taxes, the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the availability of tax credit carryforwards, see Note 2 - Income Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nIdaho Power continues to pursue significant enhancements to its utility infrastructure in an effort to ensure an adequate supply of electricity, to provide service to new customers, and to maintain system reliability. Idaho Power's existing hydroelectric and thermal generation facilities also require continuing upgrades and component replacement. Idaho Power's cash expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, excluding AFUDC, were $268 million in 2018, $277 million in 2017, and $287 million in 2016. Idaho Power expects these substantial capital expenditures to continue, with estimated total capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion expected over the period from 2019 through 2023.\nIdaho Power funds its liquidity needs for capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, debt offerings, commercial paper markets, credit facilities, and capital contributions from IDACORP. As of February 15, 2019, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's access to debt, equity, and credit arrangements included:\n \u2022 their respective $100 million and $300 million revolving credit facilities; \n \u2022 IDACORP's shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on May 20, 2016, which may be used for the issuance of debt securities and common stock; \n \u2022 Idaho Power's shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on May 20, 2016, which may be used for the issuance of first mortgage bonds and debt securities; $280 million is available for issuance pursuant to state regulatory authority; and \n \u2022 IDACORP's and Idaho Power's issuance of commercial paper, which may be issued up to an amount equal to the available credit capacity under their respective credit facilities. \nBased on planned capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expenses for 2019, the companies believe they will be able to meet capital requirements and fund corporate expenses during 2019 with a combination of existing cash and operating cash flows generated by Idaho Power's utility business, together with proceeds from either draws on credit facilities or Idaho Power's issuance of debt securities. IDACORP and Idaho Power believe they could meet any short-term cash shortfall with existing credit facilities and expect to continue to manage short-term liquidity through commercial paper markets.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power monitor capital markets with a view toward opportunistic debt and equity transactions, taking into account current and potential future long-term needs. As a result, IDACORP may issue debt securities or common stock, and Idaho Power may issue debt securities, if the companies believe terms available in the capital markets are favorable and that issuances would be financially prudent. Idaho Power also periodically analyzes whether partial or full early redemption of one or more existing outstanding series of first mortgage bonds is desirable, and in some cases, may refinance indebtedness with new indebtedness. To that end, in March 2018, Idaho Power issued $220 million in principal amount of 4.20% first mortgage bonds, Series K, maturing on March 1, 2048. In April 2018, Idaho Power redeemed, prior to its maturity, its $130 million in principal amount of 4.50% first mortgage bonds, Series H, due March 2020. In accordance with the redemption provisions of the original terms of the notes, the redemption included Idaho Power's payment of a make-whole premium of $4.6 million, the cost of which provided a flow-through tax deduction. Idaho Power used a portion of the net proceeds of the March 2018 sale of first mortgage bonds, medium term-notes to effect the redemption.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power seek to maintain capital structures of approximately 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity, and maintaining this ratio influences IDACORP's and Idaho Power's debt and equity issuance decisions. As of December 31, 2018, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's capital structures, as calculated for purposes of applicable debt covenants, were as follows:\n\nIDACORP and Idaho Power generally maintain their cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid investments, such as U.S. Treasury Bills, money market funds, and bank deposits.\nOperating Cash Flows\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's principal sources of cash flows from operations are Idaho Power's sales of electricity and transmission capacity. Significant uses of cash flows from operations include the purchase of fuel and power, other operating expenses, interest, income taxes, and pension plan contributions. Operating cash flows can be significantly influenced by factors such as weather conditions, rates and the outcome of regulatory proceedings, and economic conditions. As fuel and purchased power are significant uses of cash, Idaho Power has regulatory mechanisms in place that provide for the deferral and recovery of the majority of the fluctuation in those costs. However, if actual costs rise above the level allowed in retail rates, deferral balances increase (reflected as a regulatory asset), negatively affecting operating cash flows until such time as those costs, with interest, are recovered from customers.\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating cash inflows in 2018 were $492 million and $418 million, respectively, an increase of $57 million for IDACORP and a $1 million increase for Idaho Power when compared with 2017. Significant items that affected the companies' operating", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) in this report, the general financial condition and results of operations for IDACORP and its subsidiaries and Idaho Power and its subsidiary are discussed. While reading the MD&A, please refer to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of IDACORP and Idaho Power. Also refer to \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and Part I - Item 1A - \"Risk Factors\" in this report for important information regarding forward-looking statements made in this MD&A and elsewhere in this report.\nINTRODUCTION\nIDACORP is a holding company whose principal operating subsidiary is Idaho Power. IDACORP's common stock is listed and trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol \"IDA\". Idaho Power is an electric utility whose rates and other matters are regulated by the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC), Public Utility Commission of Oregon (OPUC), and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Idaho Power generates revenues and cash flows primarily from the sale and distribution of electricity to customers in its Idaho and Oregon service areas, as well as from the wholesale sale and transmission of electricity.\nIdaho Power is the parent of Idaho Energy Resources Co. (IERCo), a joint venturer in Bridger Coal Company (BCC), which mines and supplies coal to the Jim Bridger generating plant owned in part by Idaho Power. IDACORP's other notable subsidiaries include IDACORP Financial Services, Inc. (IFS), an investor in affordable housing and other real estate investments; and Ida-West Energy Company, an operator of small hydroelectric generation projects that satisfy the requirements of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA).\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nIDACORP is committed to its focus on competitive total returns and generating long-term value for shareholders. IDACORP's business strategy emphasizes Idaho Power as IDACORP's core business, since Idaho Power's regulated electric utility operations are the primary driver of IDACORP's operating results. This strategy is described in Part I, Item 1 - \"Business - Business Strategy\" of this report. Examples of IDACORP's and Idaho Power's achievements and recognitions during 2018 include:\n \u2022 IDACORP achieved net income growth for an eleventh consecutive year; \n \u2022 IDACORP provided a 14 percent cumulative annual total shareholder return over the past three years, including share price appreciation and dividends paid, ranking in the 63rd percentile among peer companies in the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Electric Utilities Index; \n \u2022 IDACORP received its second EEI Electric Utilities Index award in the past three years, for the best total shareholder return performance among small cap utilities (market capitalization of less than $5 billion) over the past five years, measured as of September 30, 2018; \n \u2022 IDACORP increased its quarterly common stock dividend from $0.59 per share to $0.63 per share, as a part of a 110 percent increase in quarterly dividends approved over the last seven years under the company's objective to pay dividends at the upper end of the range of 50 percent to 60 percent of sustainable earnings; \n \u2022 Idaho Power's customer count grew 2.3 percent in 2018; \n \u2022 Idaho Power ranked second in J.D. Power's Electric Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study in its West Region Midsize segment for the second year in a row; \n \u2022 Idaho Power reached milestones on key transmission projects as the U.S. Forest Service issued a record of decision on the siting of the Boardman-to-Hemingway 500-kV project and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued a record of decision for the remaining transmission line segments of the Gateway West 500-kV transmission project; \n \u2022 Idaho Power achieved its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions intensity reduction goal; and \n \u2022 Idaho Power reached several constructive regulatory settlements that were approved by the IPUC and OPUC related to recent income tax reform, the indefinite extension, with modifications, of the current earnings support and revenue sharing mechanism, the prudence of certain Hells Canyon Complex (HCC) relicensing costs, and the treatment of costs incurred to join the energy imbalance market implemented in the western United States (Western EIM). \nSummary of 2018 Financial Results\nThe following is a summary of Idaho Power's net income, net income attributable to IDACORP, and IDACORP's earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 (in thousands, except earnings per share amounts):\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Idaho Power net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>222,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>206,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to IDACORP, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average outstanding shares -

Customer growth added $10.3 million to Idaho Power's operating income compared with 2017. Sales volumes on a per-customer basis decreased operating income by $9.4 million in 2018 compared with 2017. A decrease in sales volumes to residential customers was partially offset by an increase in usage per irrigation customer. Milder temperatures in 2018 compared with 2017 caused residential customers to use 6 percent less electricity per customer, mostly for cooling and heating purposes, while decreased precipitation led agricultural irrigation customers to use 9 percent more electricity per customer to operate irrigation pumps. However, due mostly to the lower usage by Idaho residential customers, the FCA mechanism added $17.7 million to operating income during 2018 compared with 2017.\nThe net decrease in retail revenues per MWh reduced operating income by $26.9 million in 2018 compared with 2017. The settlement stipulations approved by the IPUC and OPUC during the second quarter of 2018 relating to recent income tax reform reduced revenues by approximately $22 million in 2018. The timing of the revenue reductions may not align with decreases in income tax expense in any given period due to the method and timing of customer rate reductions provided for in the settlement\nstipulations, the nature and timing of income tax accruals, discrete items, and other items discussed in more detail in the \"Income Tax Reform\" section below. Also, a change in customer sales mix reduced the retail revenues per MWh as volumes sold to residential customers made up a smaller portion of the customer sales mix.\nDuring 2018, Idaho Power benefited from a $16.1 million increase in transmission wheeling and other revenues, compared with 2017. This change was largely due to a 37 percent increase in the Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) rate in October 2017, partially offset by a 10 percent decrease in the OATT rate in October 2018 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in wheeling volumes.\nOther O&M expenses included $4.0 million of non-cash amortization expense of regulatory deferrals that would otherwise be a future liability of Idaho customers, as provided by the settlement stipulation approved by the IPUC related to income tax reform. Excluding the non-cash amortization of regulatory deferrals, other O&M expenses were $13.8 million higher in 2018 compared with 2017. In 2018, compared with 2017, higher maintenance service costs led to a $4.2 million increase in transmission and distribution asset maintenance expenses, and higher variable employee-related costs led to an $8.4 million increase in labor and benefit expenses.\nIn 2018, Idaho Power recorded $5.0 million as a provision against current revenues to be refunded to customers through a future rate reduction, through the Idaho-jurisdiction power cost adjustment (PCA) mechanism pursuant to a settlement stipulation with the IPUC as described in \"Regulation of Rates and Cost Recovery\" below.\nIdaho Power's $5.7 million remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from the federal and Idaho income tax rate change (discussed in further detail below) on the adjustment of temporary differences as a result of IDACORP's 2017 consolidated income tax return filings and the $1.3 million flow-through benefit of a tax deductible make-whole premium that Idaho Power paid in connection with the early redemption of long-term debt in April 2018 decreased Idaho Power's income tax expense by $7.0 million in 2018. Idaho Power recorded $2.0 million of income tax expense in 2017 for the initial remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from the federal and Idaho income tax rate change. Excluding these items, Idaho Power income tax expense was $23.9 million lower during 2018 compared with 2017, due mostly to the lower federal and state statutory income tax rates resulting from income tax reform.\n2018 Initiatives and Strategy\nIDACORP's strategy is focused on four areas: growing to enhance financial strength, improving Idaho Power's core business, enhancing Idaho Power's brand, and focusing on safety and employee engagement. IDACORP's board of directors has reviewed and affirmed IDACORP's long-term strategy. In executing on these four strategic focus areas, IDACORP seeks to balance the interests of shareowners, Idaho Power customers, employees, and other stakeholders. Idaho Power is working to continue to provide safe, fair-priced, reliable service to its customers from a diversified source of generation resources, with a continued commitment to strong, sustainable financial results. For more information on the business strategy of the companies, see Part I, Item 1 - Business - Business Strategy\u201d in this report.\nOverview of General Factors and Trends Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition are affected by a number of factors, and the impact of those factors is discussed in more detail below in this MD&A. To provide context for the discussion elsewhere in this report, some of the more notable factors include the following:\n \u2022 Regulation of Rates and Cost Recovery: The price that Idaho Power is authorized to charge for its electric and transmission service is a critical factor in determining IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. Those rates are established by state regulatory commissions and the FERC and are intended to allow Idaho Power an opportunity to recover its expenses and earn a reasonable return on investment. Idaho Power focuses on timely recovery of its costs through filings with its regulators, working to put in place innovative regulatory mechanisms, and on the prudent management of expenses and investments. Idaho Power has regulatory settlement stipulations in Idaho that include provisions for the accelerated amortization of certain tax credits to help achieve a minimum 9.5 percent (9.4 percent after 2019) return on year-end equity in the Idaho jurisdiction (Idaho ROE). The settlement stipulations also provide for the potential sharing between Idaho Power and customers of Idaho-jurisdictional earnings in excess of specified levels of Idaho ROE. The settlement stipulations provide for modifications of certain terms and the indefinite extension of the mechanism beyond the original termination date of December 31, 2019. The specific terms of these settlement stipulations are described in \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A and in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. During \n2019, Idaho Power will continue to assess the need to file a general rate case to reset base rates, but does not anticipate filing a rate case in the next twelve months.\n \u2022 Income Tax Reform: In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, which lowered the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and modified or eliminated certain federal income tax deductions for corporations (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). The majority of the changes, including the rate reduction, became effective on January 1, 2018. In March 2018, Idaho House Bill 463 was signed into law reducing the Idaho state corporate income tax rate from 7.4 percent to 6.925 percent. In May 2018, the IPUC issued an order approving a settlement stipulation related to these changes in income taxes (May 2018 Idaho Tax Reform Settlement Stipulation). Beginning June 1, 2018, the settlement stipulation provided an annual (a) $18.7 million reduction to Idaho customer base rates and (b) $7.4 million for the amortization of regulatory deferrals that would otherwise be a future liability recoverable from Idaho customers. Additionally, a one-time benefit of a $7.8 million rate reduction is being provided to Idaho customers through the PCA mechanism during the period from June 2018 through May 2019, for the income tax reform benefits accrued from January 2018 to May 2018 and for amounts included in Idaho Power's transmission revenues. The May 2018 Idaho Tax Reform Settlement Stipulation was designed to return to Idaho customers their share of the estimated annual pro forma tax expense reductions resulting from income tax reform, based on the full-year 2017 as required by the IPUC. Idaho Power's financial results from 2018 forward will be affected by any differences between annual income tax expense and the pro forma 2017 income tax expense used in the settlement until incorporated into a future rate proceeding or rate case. Refer to \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A for more information on the related regulatory proceedings. \n \u2022 Economic Conditions and Loads: Economic conditions impact consumer demand for energy, revenues, collectability of accounts, the volume of wholesale energy sales, and the need to construct and improve infrastructure, purchase power, and implement programs to meet customer load demands. In recent years, Idaho Power has seen growth in the number of customers in its service area. In 2018, Idaho Power's customer count grew by 2.3 percent, and employment in Idaho Power's service area grew by approximately 2.2 percent based on Idaho Department of Labor preliminary December 2018 data. Idaho Power expects its number of customers to continue to increase in the foreseeable future. Idaho Power has in recent years supported State of Idaho-coordinated efforts to promote economic development with an emphasis on attracting industrial and commercial customers to its service area. \nIn August 2018, Idaho Power began preparing its 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), Idaho Power's long-term forecast of loads and resources. For more information on the 2019 IRP, including the preliminary load forecast assumptions Idaho Power expects to use in its 2019 IRP, refer to \"Resource Planning\" in Item 1 - \"Business\" in this Form 10-K.\n \u2022 Weather Conditions: Weather and agricultural growing conditions have a significant impact on Idaho Power's energy sales. Relatively low and high temperatures result in greater energy use for heating and cooling, respectively. During the agricultural growing season, which in large part occurs during the second and third quarters, irrigation customers use electricity to operate irrigation pumps, and weather conditions can impact the timing and extent of use of those pumps. Idaho Power also has tiered rates and seasonal rates, which contribute to increased revenues during higher-load periods, most notably during the third quarter of each year, when overall customer demand is highest. Much of the adverse or favorable impact of weather on sales of energy to Idaho residential and small commercial customers is mitigated through the FCA mechanism, which is described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements in this report. \nFurther, as Idaho Power's hydroelectric facilities comprise approximately one-half of Idaho Power's nameplate generation capacity, precipitation levels impact the mix of Idaho Power's generation resources. When hydroelectric generation is reduced, Idaho Power must rely on more expensive generation sources and purchased power. When favorable hydroelectric generating conditions exist for Idaho Power, they also may exist for other Pacific Northwest hydroelectric facility operators, lowering regional wholesale market prices and impacting the revenue Idaho Power receives from wholesale energy sales of its excess power. Much of the adverse or favorable impact of this volatility is addressed through the Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms.\n \u2022 Rate Base Growth and Infrastructure Investment: As noted above, the rates established by the IPUC and OPUC are determined with the intent to provide an opportunity for Idaho Power to recover authorized operating expenses and earn a reasonable return on rate base.\u201d Rate base is generally determined by reference to the original cost (net of accumulated depreciation) of utility plant in service and certain other assets, subject to various adjustments for deferred taxes and other items. Over time, rate base is increased by additions to utility plant in service and reduced by depreciation and retirement of utility plant and write-offs as authorized by the IPUC and OPUC. In recent years, Idaho \nPower has been pursuing significant enhancements to its utility infrastructure in an effort to maintain system reliability, ensure an adequate supply of electricity, and to provide service to new customers, including major ongoing transmission projects such as the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West projects. Idaho Power's existing hydroelectric and thermal generation facilities also require continuing upgrades and equipment replacement, and the company is undertaking a significant relicensing effort for the HCC, its largest hydroelectric generation resource. Idaho Power intends to pursue timely inclusion of any significant completed capital projects into rate base as part of a future general rate case or other appropriate regulatory proceeding.\n \u2022 Mitigation of Impact of Fuel and Purchased Power Expense: In addition to hydroelectric generation, Idaho Power relies heavily on natural gas and coal to fuel its generation facilities and power purchases in the wholesale markets. Fuel costs are impacted by electricity sales volumes, the terms and conditions of contracts for fuel, Idaho Power's generation capacity, the availability of hydroelectric generation resources, transmission capacity, energy market prices, and Idaho Power's hedging program for managing fuel costs. Recently, low natural gas prices have made operation of Idaho Power's natural gas power plants more economical, resulting in increased operation of those plants and decreased operation of coal-fired plants. Purchased power costs are impacted by the terms and conditions of contracts for purchased power, the rate of expansion of alternative energy generation sources such as wind or solar energy, and wholesale energy market prices. The Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms mitigate in large part the potential adverse impacts of fluctuations in power supply costs to Idaho Power. \n \u2022 Regulatory and Environmental Compliance Costs: Idaho Power is subject to extensive federal and state laws, policies, and regulations, as well as regulatory actions and audits by agencies and quasi-governmental agencies, including the FERC, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Compliance with these requirements directly influences Idaho Power's operating environment and affects Idaho Power's operating costs. Recently, energy industry regulators have issued substantial penalties for utilities alleged to have violated reliability and critical infrastructure protection requirements. Moreover, environmental laws and regulations, in particular, may increase the cost of operating generation plants, including Idaho Power's coal-fired plants, and constructing new facilities, require that Idaho Power install additional pollution control devices at existing generating plants, or require that Idaho Power cease operating certain generation plants. Idaho Power expects to spend a considerable amount on environmental compliance and controls in the next decade, and due to economic factors in part associated with the costs of compliance with environmental regulation, has accelerated the retirement dates of certain of its coal-fired power plants. \n \u2022 Water Management and Relicensing of the Hells Canyon Hydroelectric Project: Because of Idaho Power's reliance on stream flow in the Snake River and its tributaries, Idaho Power participates in numerous proceedings and venues that may affect its water rights, seeking to preserve the long-term availability of its rights for its hydroelectric projects. Also, Idaho Power is involved in renewing its long-term federal license for the HCC, its largest hydroelectric generation source. Given the number of parties and issues involved, Idaho Power's relicensing costs have been and are expected to continue to be substantial. Idaho Power cannot currently determine the terms of, and costs associated with, any resulting long-term license. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section of MD&A takes a closer look at the significant factors that affected IDACORP's and Idaho Power's earnings. In this analysis, the results for 2018 are compared with 2017 and the results for 2017 are compared with 2016.\nThe table below presents Idaho Power's energy sales and supply (in thousands of MWh) for the last three years.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail energy sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale energy sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>742\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bundled energy sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>444\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total energy sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hydroelectric generation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal generation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas and other generation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total system generation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchased power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,345\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,223\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,130\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total energy supply\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor purposes of illustration, Boise, Idaho, weather-related information for the last three years is presented in the table that follows.\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Normal(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Heating degree-days(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cooling degree-days(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>942\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Precipitation (inches)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Heating and cooling degree-days are common measures used in the utility industry to analyze the demand for electricity and indicate when a customer would use electricity for heating and air conditioning. A degree-day measures how much the average daily temperature varies from 65 degrees. Each degree above 65 degrees is counted as one cooling degree-day, and each degree below 65 degrees is counted as one heating degree-day. While Boise, Idaho weather conditions are not necessarily representative of weather conditions throughout Idaho Power's service area, the greater Boise area has the majority of Idaho Power's customers.\n(2) Normal heating degree-days and cooling degree-days elements are, by convention, the arithmetic mean of the elements computed over 30 consecutive years. The annual normal amounts are the sum of the 12 monthly normal amounts. These normal amounts are computed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nSales Volume and Generation: In 2018, retail sales volumes were relatively flat compared with those of the prior year. Customer growth increased sales volumes during 2018 compared with 2017, with the number of Idaho Power's customers growing by 2.3 percent. During 2018, usage per irrigation customer was approximately 9 percent higher compared with 2017. Precipitation in the Idaho Power service area during 2018 was significantly less than in 2017, which increased usage by irrigation customers in 2018. Usage per residential customer was approximately 6 percent lower in 2018 compared with 2017. The decrease in residential usage was primarily due to milder weather during 2018 compared with 2017, which decreased the use of electricity for heating and cooling purposes. Cooling degree-days in Boise, Idaho were 17 percent lower during 2018 compared with 2017, but 18 percent above normal. Heating degree-days in Boise, Idaho were 12 percent lower during 2018 compared with 2017, and 10 percent below normal. Also, bundled energy sales (electric power combined with renewable energy certificates) volumes increased during 2018 compared with 2017. The solar generation projects under PURPA contracts that were initiated in 2017 generated an increased number of renewable energy credits to sell bundled with electricity.\nTotal system generation decreased 2 percent during 2018 compared with 2017. Hydroelectric generation decreased 2 percent during 2018 compared with 2017, but comprised 65 percent of Idaho Power's total system generation during both 2018 and 2017. In 2018, purchased power increased 28 percent compared with 2017 due to an increase in power purchased from generation projects under mandatory PURPA contracts and an increase in other purchased power resulting from favorable wholesale gas and electricity market conditions and, to a lesser extent, transactions in the Western EIM, which commenced in\nApril 2018. The availability of hydroelectric generation and an increase in purchased power during 2018 reduced thermal generation compared with 2017.\nWholesale energy sales volumes increased 312 thousand MWh, or 16 percent, during 2018 compared with 2017, due primarily to an increase in purchased power, both in market purchases and in purchases under PURPA contracts, resulting in increased energy available for wholesale energy sales. However, the high purchase price of power under federally mandated PURPA purchases is often in excess of the price at which Idaho Power sells the power in the wholesale energy markets.\nThe financial impacts of fluctuations in wholesale energy sales, purchased power, fuel expense, and other power supply-related expenses are addressed in Idaho Power's Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms, which are described below in \"Power Cost Adjustment Mechanisms.\"\nOperating Revenues\nRetail Revenues: The table below presents Idaho Power's retail revenues (in thousands), MWh sales

represent revenue from contracts with customers.\n(2) As part of its January 30, 2009, general rate case order, the IPUC is allowing Idaho Power to recover a portion of the allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) on construction work in progress related to the HCC relicensing process, even though the relicensing process is not yet complete and the costs have not been moved to electric plant in service. Idaho Power is collecting approximately $8.8 million annually in the Idaho jurisdiction but is deferring revenue recognition of the amounts collected until the license is issued and the accumulated license costs approved for recovery are placed in service. Prior to the May 2018 Idaho Tax Reform Settlement Stipulation described in \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A, Idaho Power was collecting $10.7 million annually.\nChanges in rates, changes in customer demand, and changes in FCA mechanism revenues are the primary reasons for fluctuations in retail revenues from period to period. See \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A for a list of rate changes implemented over the last three years. The primary influences on customer demand for electricity are weather, economic conditions, and energy efficiency. Extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating, while mild temperatures decrease sales. Precipitation levels and the timing of precipitation during the agricultural growing season also affect sales to customers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps. Rates are also seasonally adjusted, providing for higher rates during summer peak load periods, and residential customer rates are tiered, providing for higher rates\nbased on higher levels of usage. The seasonal and tiered rate structures contribute to seasonal fluctuations in revenues and earnings.\nRetail Revenues - 2018 Compared with 2017: Retail revenues decreased $30.8 million in 2018 compared with 2017. The primary factors affecting retail revenues during the period were the following:\n \u2022 Rates: Rate changes decreased retail revenues by $39.0 million in 2018 compared with 2017. As a direct result of settlement stipulations approved by the IPUC and OPUC during the second quarter of 2018 relating to income tax reform described further in \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A, Idaho Power's revenues decreased approximately $22 million in 2018 compared with 2017. The timing of the revenue reductions may not align with decreases in income tax expense in any given period due to the method and timing of customer rate reductions provided for in the settlement stipulations, the nature and timing of income tax accruals, discrete items, and other items discussed in this MD&A. The rates include collection of amounts related to the PCA mechanism, which decreased revenues by $15.4 million in 2018 compared with 2017. The collection of amounts related to the PCA mechanism in rates has no effect on operating income as a corresponding amount is recorded as expense in the same period it is collected through rates. \n \u2022 Customers: Customer growth of 2.3 percent increased retail revenues by $13.5 million in 2018 compared with 2017. \n \u2022 Usage: Lower usage (on a per customer basis), primarily by residential customers, decreased retail revenues by $18.0 million during 2018 compared with 2017. Decreased usage was primarily the result of more mild temperatures in Idaho Power's service area during 2018 compared with 2017, which led to decreased usage by residential customers for heating and cooling. For 2018, a 6 percent decrease in usage per residential customer compared with 2017 was partially offset by a 9 percent increase in usage per irrigation customer. Precipitation in Idaho Power's service area during 2018 was significantly less than 2017, which led to increased usage by irrigation customers. \n \u2022 Idaho FCA Revenue: The FCA mechanism, applicable to Idaho residential and small commercial customers, adjusts revenue each year to accrue, or defer, the difference between the authorized fixed-cost recovery amount per customer and the actual fixed costs per customer recovered by Idaho Power through volume-based rates during the year. Lower usage (on a per customer basis) by residential and small general service customers during 2018 increased the amount of FCA revenue accrued by $17.7 million compared with 2017. \n \u2022 Sharing: During 2018, Idaho Power recorded $5.0 million as a provision against current revenues to be refunded to customers through a future rate reduction. If approved, the rate reduction would be included in PCA rates beginning in June 2019. Idaho Power did not record any provision for sharing in 2017. This revenue sharing arrangement, which requires Idaho Power to share with Idaho customers a portion of Idaho-jurisdiction earnings exceeding a 10.0 percent Idaho ROE, is related to the October 2014 Idaho Earnings Support and Sharing Settlement Stipulation. The October 2014 Idaho Earnings Support and Sharing Settlement Stipulation is described further in \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A and in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. \nRetail Revenues - 2017 Compared with 2016: Retail revenues increased $60.0 million in 2017 compared with 2016. The factors affecting retail revenues during the period are discussed below:\n \u2022 Rates: Rate changes, including the revenue accruals provided for in the Valmy settlement stipulation, increased retail revenues by $39.8 million for 2017 compared with 2016. In the second quarter of 2017, the IPUC and OPUC each approved settlement stipulations related to Idaho Power's plan to end its participation in coal-fired operations at the Valmy Plant by the end of 2025, which increased retail revenues collections and retail revenues accruals for 2017 compared with 2016. Colder winter temperatures in early 2017 and warmer summer temperatures during the third quarter of 2017 resulted in residential sales making up a larger portion of the sales mix and led to a greater proportion of residential sales in higher rate categories in Idaho Power's tiered rate structure in 2017 compared with 2016. \n \u2022 Customers: Customer growth of 2.0 percent increased retail revenues by $12.1 million in 2017 compared with 2016. \n \u2022 Usage: Higher usage (on a per customer basis), primarily by residential, industrial, and commercial customers increased retail revenues by $20.1 million in 2017 compared with 2016. Increased usage was primarily the result of warmer summer temperatures and colder winter temperatures in Idaho Power's service area, which increased usage by residential customers for cooling and heating. Cooling degree days and heating degree days were significantly higher in 2017 compared with 2016. These increases in usage were partially offset by an 11 percent decrease in usage per irrigation customer due to increased precipitation in Idaho Power's service area during 2017 compared with 2016, \nparticularly in the first six months of 2017. Greater customer participation in energy efficiency programs, resulting in decreased usage, partially offset the increase in total usage during 2017 compared with 2016.\n \u2022 Idaho FCA Revenue: The FCA mechanism, applicable to Idaho residential and small commercial customers, adjusts revenue each year to accrue, or defer, the difference between the authorized fixed-cost recovery amount per customer and the actual fixed costs per customer recovered by Idaho Power through volume-based rates during the year. Higher usage (on a per customer basis) by residential and small general service customers during 2017 decreased the amount of FCA revenue accrued by $12.1 million compared with 2016. Idaho Power accrued $18.2 million of FCA revenue in 2017 compared with $30.3 million of FCA revenue in 2016. \nWholesale Energy Sales: Wholesale energy sales consist primarily of long-term sales contracts, opportunity sales of surplus system energy, and sales into the Western EIM, and do not include derivative transactions. The table below presents Idaho Power's wholesale energy sales for the last three years (in thousands, except for MWh amounts).\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale energy revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale MWh sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>742\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale energy revenues per MWh\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWholesale Energy Sales - 2018 Compared with 2017: In 2018, wholesale energy revenue increased by $28.1 million, or 113 percent, compared with 2017. Wholesale energy sales volumes increased 16 percent in 2018 compared with 2017, and the average price of wholesale energy sales was 84 percent higher for 2018 compared with 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2018, a natural gas pipeline ruptured in British Columbia, Canada, disrupting natural gas flows to the Pacific Northwest and Western Canada, driving up energy and natural gas prices in the region, including in Idaho Power's service area. An increase in purchased power, both in market purchases and in purchases under PURPA contracts, resulted in additional energy available for wholesale energy sales in 2018 compared with 2017. However, the high purchase price of power under federally mandated PURPA purchases is often in excess of the price at which Idaho Power sells the power in the wholesale energy markets. The increase in wholesale energy sales volumes and sales prices during 2018 compared with 2017 was also due to transactions in the Western EIM, which commenced in April 2018. Under the Western EIM, participating parties enable their systems to interact for automated intra-hour economic dispatch of generation from committed resources to serve loads.\nWholesale Energy Sales - 2017 Compared with 2016: For 2017, wholesale energy sales revenue increased by $12.9 million, or 108 percent compared with 2016 as generation from Idaho Power's hydroelectric plants increased due to significantly greater precipitation in 2017 compared with 2016. The increase in hydroelectric generation resulted in more energy available for wholesale energy sales in 2017 compared with 2016. The average price of wholesale energy sales was 20 percent lower for 2017 compared with 2016, as an increase in output from hydroelectric resources in the northwest United States region due to increased precipitation during the period, as well as additional output from new wind and solar projects throughout the region, increased surplus power available for sale and decreased wholesale power market prices.\nTransmission Wheeling Revenues: Revenue from transmission wheeling increased $15.1 million, or 34 percent, in 2018 compared with 2017, largely due to Idaho Power's OATT rate that increased in October 2017 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in wheeling volumes. In October 2017, Idaho Power's OATT rate increased from $25.52 per kW-year to $34.90 per kW-year. In October 2018, the rate decreased to $31.25 per kW-year. Refer to \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A for more information on Idaho Power's OATT rate. Revenue from transmission wheeling increased $11.5 million, or 35 percent, in 2017 compared with 2016, largely due to an increase in wheeling volumes, an increase in Idaho Power's OATT rate, and a new long-term wheeling agreement that became effective in July 2016.\nEnergy Efficiency Program Revenues: In both Idaho and Oregon, energy efficiency riders fund energy efficiency program expenditures. Expenditures funded through the riders are reported as an operating expense with an equal amount recorded in revenues, resulting in no net impact on earnings. The cumulative variances between expenditures and amounts collected through the riders are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. A liability balance indicates that Idaho Power has collected more than it has spent and an asset balance indicates that Idaho Power has spent more than it has collected. At December 31, 2018, Idaho Power's energy efficiency rider balances were a $5.3 million regulatory liability in the Idaho jurisdiction and a $1.4 million regulatory asset in the Oregon jurisdiction.\nOperating Expenses\nPurchased Power: The table below presents Idaho Power's purchased power expenses and volumes for the last three years (in thousands, except for MWh amounts).\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PURPA contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other purchased power (including wheeling)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total purchased power expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>293,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MWh purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PURPA contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other purchased power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total MWh purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost per MWh from PURPA contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost per MWh from other sources\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Weighted average - all sources\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIdaho Power is required by federal law to purchase power from some PURPA generation projects at a specified price regardless of the then-current load demand or wholesale energy market prices. The intermittent, non-dispatchable nature of most PURPA generation increases the likelihood that Idaho Power will at times be required to reduce output from its lower-cost hydroelectric and fossil fuel-fired generation resources and may be required to sell its excess power in the wholesale power market at a significant loss. The other purchased power cost per MWh often exceeds the wholesale energy sales revenue per MWh because Idaho Power generally needs to purchase more power during heavy load periods than during light load periods, and conversely has less energy available for wholesale energy sales during heavy load periods than light load periods. Market energy prices are typically higher during heavy load periods than during light load periods. Also, in accordance with Idaho Power's risk management policy, Idaho Power may purchase or sell energy several months in advance of anticipated delivery. The regional energy market price is dynamic and additional energy transactions that Idaho Power makes at current market prices may be noticeably different than the advance transaction prices. Most of the non-PURPA purchased power and substantially all of the PURPA power purchase costs are recovered through base rates and Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms.\nPurchased Power - 2018 Compared with 2017: Purchased power expense increased $44.9 million, or 18 percent, in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to a 65 percent increase in the volume of other non-PURPA power purchases and a 9 percent increase in the volume of power purchases from generation projects under PURPA contracts. Other purchased power volumes increased during 2018 compared with 2017 due to wholesale gas and electricity market conditions and due to transactions in the Western EIM, which commenced in April 2018. These volume increases were partially offset by decreases in cost per MWh of power purchased from sources other than PURPA contracts.\nPurchased Power - 2017 Compared with 2016: Purchased power expense increased $3.2 million, or 1 percent, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to an increase in generation provided by PURPA solar contracts. The increase in PURPA volumes was partially offset by decreases in costs per MWh. Other purchased power expense decreased $12.9 million, or 14 percent, as abundant hydroelectric generation in 2017 compared with 2016 reduced the need for market purchases to meet load requirements.\nFuel Expense: The table below presents Idaho Power's fuel expenses and thermal generation for the last three years (in thousands, except per MWh amounts).\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total fuel expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MWh generated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total MWh generated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost per MWh - Coal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost per MWh - Natural gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average, all sources\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes a negligible amount of expense and generation related to the Salmon diesel-fired generation plant.\nThe majority of the fuel for Idaho Power's jointly-owned coal-fired plants is purchased through long-term contracts, including purchases from BCC, a one-third owned joint venture of IERCo. The price of coal from BCC is subject to fluctuations in mine operating expenses, geologic conditions, and production levels. BCC supplies up to two-thirds of the coal used by the Jim Bridger plant. Natural gas is mainly purchased on the regional wholesale spot market at published index prices. In addition to commodity (variable) costs, both natural gas and coal expenses include costs that are more fixed in nature for items such as capacity charges, transportation, and fuel handling. Period to period variances in fuel expense per MWh are noticeably impacted by these fixed charges when generation output is substantially different between the periods.\nFuel Expense - 2018 Compared with 2017: Fuel expense decreased $12.6 million, or 9 percent, in 2018 compared with 2017. In October 2018, a natural gas pipeline ruptured in British Columbia, Canada, which disrupted natural gas distribution to the Pacific Northwest region and Western Canada, and drove up energy prices in the region. In accordance with its ongoing risk management policies, Idaho Power held a number of financial gas hedges at the time of the rupture. Fuel expense in the fourth quarter of 2018 included $23.3 million in gains on financial gas hedges, which reduced natural gas fuel expense. Idaho Power was able to meet natural gas needs by purchasing physical gas from sources unaffected by the rupture. Most of these realized hedging gains will be a benefit to customers through the power cost adjustment mechanisms described below.\nFuel Expense - 2017 Compared with 2016: Fuel expense decreased $33.7 million, or 19 percent, in 2017 compared with 2016, due primarily to increased output from Idaho Power's hydroelectric plants, which reduced utilization of gas and coal generation. Generation from the hydroelectric plants increased 39 percent during 2017 compared with 2016.\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanisms: Idaho Power's power supply costs (primarily purchased power and fuel expense, less wholesale energy sales) can vary significantly from year to year. Volatility of power supply costs arises from factors such as weather conditions, wholesale market prices, volumes of power purchased and sold in the wholesale markets, Idaho Power's hydroelectric and thermal generation volumes and fuel costs, generation plant availability, and retail loads. To address the volatility of power supply costs, Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms in the Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions allow Idaho Power to recover from customers, or refund to customers, most of the fluctuations in power supply costs. In the Idaho jurisdiction, the PCA includes a cost or benefit sharing ratio that allocates the deviations in net power supply expenses between customers (95 percent) and Idaho Power (5 percent), with the exception of PURPA power purchases and demand response program incentives, which are allocated 100 percent to customers. The Idaho deferral period, or PCA year, runs from April 1 through March 31. Amounts deferred during the PCA year are primarily recovered or refunded during the subsequent June 1 through May 31 period. Because of the power cost adjustment mechanisms, the primary financial impacts of power supply cost variations is that cash is paid out but recovery from customers does not occur until a future period, or cash that is collected is refunded to customers in a future period, resulting in fluctuations in operating cash flows from year to year.\nThe table below presents the components of the Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms for the last three years (in thousands).\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Power supply cost accrual (deferral)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(43,841\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of prior year authorized balances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total power cost adjustment expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,330\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe power supply accruals represent the portion of the power supply cost fluctuations accrued under the power cost adjustment mechanisms. When actual power supply costs are lower than the amount forecasted in power cost adjustment rates, which was the case for 2018 and 2017, most of the difference is accrued. When actual power supply costs are higher than the amount forecasted in power cost adjustment rates, which was the case for 2016, most of the difference is deferred. The amortization of the prior year's balances represents the offset to the amounts being collected or refunded in the current power cost adjustment year that were deferred or accrued in the prior power cost adjustment year (the true-up component of the power cost adjustment mechanism).\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanisms - 2018 Compared with 2017: Actual net power supply costs decreased in 2018 relative to forecasted costs, resulting in a change of $26.9 million-from accruals of $14.7 million to accruals of $41.5 million. The increase in accruals is due in part to lower natural gas fuel costs and purchased power, as explained above, combined with more surplus sales than forecasted. In addition, Idaho Power recorded $0.6 million of amortization of the prior-year authorized balances in 2018, compared with $37.4 million of amortization in 2017.\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanisms - 2017 Compared with 2016: Actual net power supply costs decreased in 2017 relative to forecasted costs, resulting in a change of $58.5 million-from deferrals of $43.8 million to accruals of $14.7 million. The change from deferrals in 2016 to accruals in 2017 is due in part to the lower fuel costs and purchased power, combined with more surplus sales than forecasted. The $37.4 million of amortization of prior year authorized balances in 2017 offsets the collection from customers of prior years' deferrals.\nOther Operations and Maintenance Expenses: The changes in other O&M expenses for the periods presented are discussed below.\nO&M - 2018 Compared with 2017: Other O&M expenses increased $17.8 million, or 5 percent, in 2018 compared with 2017. As provided by the settlement stipulation approved by the IPUC related to recent income tax reform, other O&M expenses in 2018 also included $4.0 million of non-cash amortization expense of regulatory deferrals that would otherwise be a future liability of Idaho customers. In 2018, compared with 2017, higher maintenance service costs led to a $4.2 million increase in transmission and distribution asset maintenance expenses, and higher variable employee-related costs led to an $8.4 million increase in labor and benefit expenses.\nO&M - 2017 Compared with 2016: Other O&M expense decreased by $2.2 million in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to a $2.4 million decrease related to previously expensed energy efficiency rider-funded costs deemed to be prudently incurred and a $2.7 million decrease in thermal O&M expenses due to lower generation at thermal plants. These decreases in O&M were partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in O&M related to a settlement stipulation in Idaho that established the reasonableness of the HCC relicensing costs incurred through December 2015 as further discussed in \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A.\nIncome Taxes\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's 2018 income tax expense decreased $31.3 million and $33.0 million, respectively, when\ncompared with 2017. The decrease was primarily due to: (1) the Tax Cut and Jobs Act's reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent that became effective January 1, 2018, (2) the remeasurement of deferred income tax balances related to IDACORP's 2017 consolidated income tax return filings, and (3) a flow-through income tax benefit at Idaho Power related to the tax deduction for a bond make-whole premium that was paid in 2018.\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's 2017 income tax expense increased $12.2 million and $14.1 million, respectively, when\ncompared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings at Idaho Power in 2017, and the $5.6 million\nflow-through benefit of a tax deductible make-whole premium that Idaho Power paid in connection with the early redemption of long-term debt in 2016. There were no early redemptions of long-term debt in 2017. These increases in income tax expense\nwere partially offset by greater net flow-through income tax items at Idaho Power.\nFor additional information relating to IDACORP's and Idaho Power's income taxes, the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the availability of tax credit carryforwards, see Note 2 - Income Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nIdaho Power continues to pursue significant enhancements to its utility infrastructure in an effort to ensure an adequate supply of electricity, to provide service to new customers, and to maintain system reliability. Idaho Power's existing hydroelectric and thermal generation facilities also require continuing upgrades and component replacement. Idaho Power's cash expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, excluding AFUDC, were $268 million in 2018, $277 million in 2017, and $287 million in 2016. Idaho Power expects these substantial capital expenditures to continue, with estimated total capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion expected over the period from 2019 through 2023.\nIdaho Power funds its liquidity needs for capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, debt offerings, commercial paper markets, credit facilities, and capital contributions from IDACORP. As of February 15, 2019, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's access to debt, equity, and credit arrangements included:\n \u2022 their respective $100 million and $300 million revolving credit facilities; \n \u2022 IDACORP's shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on May 20, 2016, which may be used for the issuance of debt securities and common stock; \n \u2022 Idaho Power's shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on May 20, 2016, which may be used for the issuance of first mortgage bonds and debt securities; $280 million is available for issuance pursuant to state regulatory authority; and \n \u2022 IDACORP's and Idaho Power's issuance of commercial paper, which may be issued up to an amount equal to the available credit capacity under their respective credit facilities. \nBased on planned capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expenses for 2019, the companies believe they will be able to meet capital requirements and fund corporate expenses during 2019 with a combination of existing cash and operating cash flows generated by Idaho Power's utility business, together with proceeds from either draws on credit facilities or Idaho Power's issuance of debt securities. IDACORP and Idaho Power believe they could meet any short-term cash shortfall with existing credit facilities and expect to continue to manage short-term liquidity through commercial paper markets.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power monitor capital markets with a view toward opportunistic debt and equity transactions, taking into account current and potential future long-term needs. As a result, IDACORP may issue debt securities or common stock, and Idaho Power may issue debt securities, if the companies believe terms available in the capital markets are favorable and that issuances would be financially prudent. Idaho Power also periodically analyzes whether partial or full early redemption of one or more existing outstanding series of first mortgage bonds is desirable, and in some cases, may refinance indebtedness with new indebtedness. To that end, in March 2018, Idaho Power issued $220 million in principal amount of 4.20% first mortgage bonds, Series K, maturing on March 1, 2048. In April 2018, Idaho Power redeemed, prior to its maturity, its $130 million in principal amount of 4.50% first mortgage bonds, Series H, due March 2020. In accordance with the redemption provisions of the original terms of the notes, the redemption included Idaho Power's payment of a make-whole premium of $4.6 million, the cost of which provided a flow-through tax deduction. Idaho Power used a portion of the net proceeds of the March 2018 sale of first mortgage bonds, medium term-notes to effect the redemption.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power seek to maintain capital structures of approximately 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity, and maintaining this ratio influences IDACORP's and Idaho Power's debt and equity issuance decisions. As of December 31, 2018, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's capital structures, as calculated for purposes of applicable debt covenants, were as follows:\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIDACORP and Idaho Power generally maintain their cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid investments, such as U.S. Treasury Bills, money market funds, and bank deposits.\nOperating Cash Flows\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's principal sources of cash flows from operations are Idaho Power's sales of electricity and transmission capacity. Significant uses of cash flows from operations include the purchase of fuel and power, other operating expenses, interest, income taxes, and pension plan contributions. Operating cash flows can be significantly influenced by factors such as weather conditions, rates and the outcome of regulatory proceedings, and economic conditions. As fuel and purchased power are significant uses of cash, Idaho Power has regulatory mechanisms in place that provide for the deferral and recovery of the majority of the fluctuation in those costs. However, if actual costs rise above the level allowed in retail rates, deferral balances increase (reflected as a regulatory asset), negatively affecting operating cash flows until such time as those costs, with interest, are recovered from customers.\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating cash inflows in 2018 were $492 million and $418 million, respectively, an increase of $57 million for IDACORP and a $1 million increase for Idaho Power when compared with 2017.
