Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences include those described in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report. We undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements.\nOVERVIEW\n2016 Highlights\nBarnes Group Inc. (the \"Company\") achieved sales of $1,230.8 million in 2016, an increase of $36.8 million, or 3.1%, from 2015. Acquired businesses contributed incremental sales of $47.4 million during 2016. Organic sales (net sales excluding both foreign currency and acquisition impacts) decreased by $1.1 million, or 0.1%, with an increase of 0.5% and a decrease of 1.3% within the Industrial and Aerospace segments, respectively. Sales in the Industrial segment were impacted by changes in foreign currency which decreased sales by approximately $9.6 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies.\nOperating income increased 14.1% from $168.4 million in 2015 to $192.2 million in 2016 and operating margin increased from 14.1% in 2015 to 15.6% in 2016. Operating income was impacted by improved productivity within Industrial and the profit contributions of the incremental sales generated at our recently acquired businesses, partially offset by unfavorable pricing within both segments. Operating income during 2016 and 2015 included $2.3 million and $2.6 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments, respectively, related to recent business acquisitions. Operating income in 2015 included a $9.9 million lump-sum pension settlement charge and $4.2 million of charges related to certain workforce reductions and restructuring charges.\nThe Company focused on profitable sales growth both organically and through acquisition, in addition to productivity improvements, as key strategic objectives in 2016. Management continued its focus on cash flow and working capital management in 2016 and generated $217.6 million in cash flow from operations.\nBusiness Transformation\nAcquisitions and strategic relationships with our customers have been a key growth driver for the Company, and we continue to seek alliances which foster long-term business relationships. These acquisitions have allowed us to extend into new or adjacent markets, expand our geographic reach, and commercialize new products, processes and services. The Company continually evaluates its business portfolio to optimize product offerings and maximize value. We have significantly transformed our business following our entrance into the plastic injection molding market.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, the Company, through three of its subsidiaries (collectively, the Purchaser\u201d), completed its acquisition of the molds business of Adval Tech Holding AG and Adval Tech Holdings (Asia) Pte. Ltd. (\"FOBOHA\"). FOBOHA is headquartered in Haslach, Germany and operates out of three manufacturing facilities located in Germany, Switzerland and China. The Company completed its purchase of the Germany and Switzerland businesses on August 31, 2016. The purchase of the China business required government approval which was granted on September 30, 2016. FOBOHA specializes in the development and manufacture of complex plastic injection molds for packaging, medical, consumer and automotive applications. The Company acquired FOBOHA for an aggregate cash purchase price of CHF 136.3 million ($138.6 million) which was financed using cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. The purchase price includes preliminary adjustments under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\"), including approximately CHF 11.3 million ($11.5 million) related to cash acquired, and is subject to post closing adjustments under the terms of the SPA. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded $39.8 million of intangible assets and $73.7 million of goodwill. See Note 2 and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company, itself and through two of its subsidiaries, completed the acquisition of privately held Priamus System Technologies AG and two of its subsidiaries (collectively, \"Priamus\") from Growth Finance AG. Priamus, which has approximately 40 employees, is headquartered in Schaffhausen, Switzerland and has direct sales and service offices in the U.S. and Germany. Priamus is a technology leader in the development of advanced process control systems for the plastic injection molding industry and services many of the world's highest quality plastic injection molders in the medical, automotive, consumer goods, electronics and packaging markets. Priamus has been integrated into our Industrial\nsegment. The Company acquired Priamus for an aggregate cash purchase price of CHF 9.9 million ($10.1 million) which was financed using cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. The purchase price includes adjustments under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, including CHF 1.6 million ($1.6 million) related to cash acquired. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the third quarter of 2015, the Company, through one of its subsidiaries, completed the acquisition of the Thermoplay business (\"Thermoplay\") by acquiring all of the capital stock of privately held HPE S.p.A., the parent company through which Thermoplay operates (\"HPE\"). Thermoplay's headquarters and manufacturing facility are located in Pont-Saint-Martin in Aosta, Italy, with technical service capabilities in China, India, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Portugal, and Brazil. Thermoplay, which has been integrated into our Industrial segment, specializes in the design, development, and manufacturing of hot runner solutions for plastic injection molding, primarily in the packaging, automotive, and medical end markets. The Company acquired Thermoplay for an aggregate cash purchase price of \u20ac58.1 million ($63.7 million), pursuant to the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\"), which was financed using cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. The purchase price includes adjustments under the terms of the SPA, including \u20ac17.1 million ($18.7 million) related to cash acquired. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement Objectives\nManagement focused on three key strategic enablers during 2016: deployment of the Barnes Enterprise System, accelerating innovation and maturing the talent management system, which, in combination, are expected to generate long-term value for the Company's stockholders and our customers. The Company's strategies for growth include both organic growth from new products, processes, systems, services, markets and customers, and growth from acquisitions. The Company's strategies for profitability include employee engagement and empowerment to drive productivity and process initiatives, such as the application of new technologies, automation and innovation, intensified focus on intellectual property as a core differentiator. A key component of the Company's culture is the Barnes Enterprise System (BES), the Company's operating system, which drives alignment and fosters continuous improvement, collaboration and innovation throughout the global organization.\nOur Business\nThe Company consists of two operating segments: Industrial and Aerospace.\nKey Performance Indicators\nManagement evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on the sales, operating profit, operating margins and cash generation of the respective businesses, which includes net sales, cost of sales, selling and administrative expenses and certain components of other income and other expenses, as well as the allocation of corporate overhead expenses. Each segment has standard key performance indicators ( KPIs\u201d), a number of which are focused on customer metrics (on-time-delivery and quality), internal effectiveness and productivity/efficiency metrics (sales effectiveness, global sourcing, operational excellence, functional excellence, sales per employee, cost of quality, and days working capital), employee safety-related metrics (total recordable incident rate and lost time incident rate), and specific KPIs on profitable growth.\nKey Industry Data\nIn both segments, management tracks a variety of economic and industry data as indicators of the health of a particular sector.\nAt Industrial, key data for the manufacturing operations include the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMI Composite Index (and similar indices for European and Asian-based businesses); the Federal Reserve's Industrial Production Index (\"the IPI\"); the Global Insight global medical and measuring equipment index; the production of light vehicles, both in the U.S. and globally; worldwide light vehicle new model introductions and existing model refreshes; North American medium and heavy duty vehicle production; and global GDP growth forecasts.\nAt Aerospace, management of the aftermarket business monitors the number of aircraft in the active fleet, the number of planes temporarily or permanently taken out of service, aircraft utilization rates for the major airlines, engine shop visits, airline profitability, aircraft fuel costs and traffic growth. The Aerospace OEM business regularly tracks orders and deliveries for each of the major aircraft manufacturers, as well as engine purchases made for new aircraft. Management also monitors annual appropriations for the U.S. military related to purchases of new or used aircraft and engine components.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSales\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>824.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>782.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>822.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerospace\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>406.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>411.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,230.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,194.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,262.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 vs. 2015:\nThe Company reported net sales of $1,230.8 million in 2016, an increase of $36.8 million, or 3.1%, from 2015. Acquired businesses contributed incremental sales of $47.4 million during the 2016 period. Organic sales within Industrial increased by $4.1 million, or 0.5%, during 2016, primarily due to strength in our Molding Solutions businesses, slightly offset by continued softness in North American general industrial end-markets. Aerospace recorded sales of $406.5 million in 2016, a $5.2 million, or 1.3% decrease from 2015. Lower sales within the OEM and spare parts businesses were partially offset by increased sales within the MRO business. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales within Industrial by approximately $9.6 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies. Sales within Aerospace were not impacted by changes in foreign currency as these are largely denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company's international sales increased 10.4% year-over-year, while domestic sales decreased 4.7%, largely a result Aerospace sales being primarily U.S.-based. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on sales, however, the Company's international sales in 2016 increased 12.0%, inclusive of sales through acquisition, from 2015.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nThe Company reported net sales of $1,194.0 million in 2015, a decrease of $68.0 million, or 5.4%, from 2014. The acquisitions of Thermoplay on August 7, 2015 and Priamus on October 1, 2015 provided sales of $13.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively, during the 2015 period. Organic sales within Industrial increased by $13.5 million, or 1.6%, during 2015, primarily due to favorable end-markets served by our tool and die and plastics businesses during the first half of 2015. A softening within our transportation and general industrial end-markets during the second half of 2015 tempered a substantial portion of the organic growth in the first half of the year. Aerospace recorded sales of $411.7 million in 2015, a $28.3 million, or 6.4% decrease from 2014. Lower sales within the OEM and MRO businesses were partially offset by increased sales within the spare parts business. The spare parts business benefited from increased demand as a result of higher aircraft utilization and customer restocking of inventory, whereas the MRO business continued to be impacted by deferred maintenance on certain platforms. The timing of customer deliveries and execution, which was partially impacted by new product introduction challenges, in addition to the impact of a contract termination dispute, directly impacted lower sales within the OEM business during the second half of 2015. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales within Industrial by approximately $68.8 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies. Sales within Aerospace were not impacted by changes in foreign currency as these are largely denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company's international sales decreased 2.4% year-over-year, while domestic sales decreased 4.7%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on sales, however, the Company's international sales in 2015 increased 7.8%, inclusive of sales through acquisition, from 2014.\nExpenses and Operating Income\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>790.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>782.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>829.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>440.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>411.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>432.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>242.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>252.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Sales less cost of sales\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 vs. 2015:\nCost of sales in 2016 increased 1.0% from 2015, while gross profit margin increased from 34.4% in 2015 to 35.8% in 2016. Gross margins improved at Industrial and decreased at Aerospace. Gross margin during the comparable 2015 period included a charge of $6.4 million related to a lump-sum pension settlement charge (see Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). At Industrial, gross profit increased during 2016 primarily as a result of favorable productivity and strength within the Molding Solutions businesses. Gross profit during 2016 was negatively impacted by $2.3 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of FOBOHA, whereas the 2015 period included $0.9 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the M\u00e4nner business and $0.9 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of Thermoplay. Within Aerospace, a decline in gross profit relates primarily to lower sales volumes and unfavorable productivity. Selling and administrative expenses in 2016 increased 2.3% from the 2015 period, due in part to $3.0 million of costs related to the contract termination dispute within the Aerospace segment and the incremental operations of the acquired businesses, partially offset by an $0.8 million reduction in short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to acquisitions. During the 2015 period, selling and administrative expenses included $4.2 million of charges related to workforce reductions and severance, and $3.5 million of lump-sum pension settlement charges. Short-term purchase accounting adjustments that impact selling and administrative expenses during 2015 included $0.6 million and $0.3 million related to the acquisitions of M\u00e4nner and Thermoplay, respectively. As a percentage of sales, selling and administrative costs decreased slightly from 20.3% in the 2015 period to 20.2% in the 2016 period. Operating income in the 2016 period increased 14.1% to $192.2 million from 2015 and operating income margin increased from 14.1% to 15.6%.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nCost of sales in 2015 decreased 5.6% from 2014, while gross profit margin increased slightly from 34.3% in 2014 to 34.4% in 2015. Gross margins remained flat at Industrial and improved slightly at Aerospace, however a higher percentage of sales were driven by the Industrial segment in 2015. The gross profit decrease during 2015 includes a charge of $6.4 million related to a lump-sum pension settlement (see Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). At Industrial, gross profit during 2014 was partially offset by $4.5 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the M\u00e4nner business and restructuring charges of $5.4 million related to the closure of the Saline facility, which was completed in 2014. During 2015, short term purchase accounting adjustments of $0.9 million and $0.9 million were related to the acquisitions of the M\u00e4nner business and Thermoplay, respectively. Within Aerospace, gross profit declined as a result lower sales within OEM, partially offset by increased profits within the spare parts business, and a $2.8 million charge related to a contract termination dispute following a customer decision to re-source. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 3.8% from 2014 due primarily to foreign exchange translation and a $3.4 million reduction in the short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the M\u00e4nner business. Lower employee related expenses, primarily from incentive compensation, reduced selling and administrative expenses during the 2015 period. The 2014 period also included $0.6 million of charges related to the closure of the Saline facility. These expense reductions during 2015 were partially offset by $4.2 million of charges related to workforce reductions and severance, $3.5 million of lump-sum pension settlement charges and $0.3 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of Thermoplay. As a percentage of sales, selling and administrative costs increased from 20.0% in 2014 to 20.3% in 2015. Operating margin was 14.1% in 2015 compared to 14.3% in 2014.\nInterest expense\n2016 vs. 2015:\nInterest expense in 2016 increased $1.2 million to $11.9 million from 2015, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nInterest expense in 2015 decreased $0.7 million to $10.7 million from 2014, primarily as a result of lower average borrowings, partially offset by higher average borrowing rates resulting from the 3.97% Senior Notes that were issued under the Note Purchase Agreement executed on October 15, 2014. See Liquidity and Capital Resources within Item 7.\nOther expense (income), net\n2016 vs. 2015:\nOther expense (income), net in 2016 was $(2.3) million compared to $(0.2) million in 2015. Foreign currency gains of $1.9 million in the 2016 period compared with gains of $0.5 million in the 2015 period. Interest income of $2.3 million in 2016 compared with interest income of $1.0 million during 2015, with the increase being primarily attributed to the $1.4 million of interest income resulting from the Triumph arbitration award. See Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nOther expense (income), net in 2015 was $(0.2) million compared to $2.1 million in 2014. Foreign currency gains of $0.5 million in the 2015 period compared with foreign currency losses of $1.5 million in the 2014 period.\nIncome Taxes\n2016 vs. 2015:\nThe Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations was 25.7% in 2016 compared with 23.2% in 2015. The increase in the 2016 effective tax rate from continuing operations is primarily due to the expiration of certain tax holidays, the absence of the 2015 refund of withholding taxes and the change in the mix of earnings attributable to higher-taxing jurisdictions, partially offset by lower repatriation of a portion of current year foreign earnings to the U.S and the excess tax benefit on stock awards, reflecting the amended guidance related to share-based payments made to employees. See Note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2016, the Company repatriated a dividend from a portion of the current year foreign earnings to the U.S. in the amount of $8.3 million compared to $19.5 million in 2015. The decrease in the dividend decreased tax expense by $3.9 million and decreased the annual effective tax rate by 2.2 percentage points compared to 2015.\nIn 2017, the Company expects the effective tax rate from continuing operations to increase to between 27% and 28% primarily due to the absence of any excess tax benefit on stock awards and the expiration of certain foreign tax holidays.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nThe Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations was 23.2% in 2015 compared with 27.6% in 2014. The decrease in 2015 is primarily due to a tax refund of withholding taxes, the granting of an extended tax holiday in China as well as a change in the mix of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions offset by an increase in the repatriation of a portion of current year foreign earnings to the U.S. During 2015, the Company repatriated a dividend from a portion of the current year foreign earnings to the U.S. in the amount of $19.5 million compared to $12.5 million in 2014. The increase in the dividend increased tax expense by $2.4 million and increased the annual effective tax rate by 1.5 percentage points compared to 2014.\nSee Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the consolidated effective income tax rate.\nIncome and Income Per Share\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except per share)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Per common share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.04\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.04\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares outstanding:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBasic and diluted income from continuing operations per common share increased for 2016 as compared to 2015, consistent with the changes in income from continuing operations year over year.

Acquired businesses contributed incremental sales of $47.4 million during the 2016 period. Organic sales increased by $4.1 million, or 0.5%, during 2016, driven primarily by strength in our Molding Solutions businesses, slightly offset by continued softness in North American general industrial end-markets. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales by approximately $9.6 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies.\nOperating profit in 2016 at Industrial was $129.7 million, an increase of 26.0% from 2015. The increase was driven by favorable productivity, as the Company continued its focus on manufacturing efficiencies and improved supply chain management across multiple units, and the profit contributions of acquired businesses, partially offset by lower pricing. The 2015 period included $3.6 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments and transaction costs related to business acquisitions, whereas the acquisition of FOBOHA during the 2016 period resulted in $3.5 million of such costs. The 2015 period also included lump-sum pension settlement charges of $7.5 million that were allocated to the segment and $3.4 million of charges related to certain workforce reductions and restructuring.\nOutlook:\nIn Industrial, management is focused on generating organic sales growth through the introduction of new products and by leveraging the benefits of the diversified products and industrial end-markets in which its businesses have a global presence. Our ability to generate sales growth is subject to economic conditions in the global markets served by all of our businesses. For general industrial end-markets, manufacturing Purchasing Managers Indexes (\"PMIs\") above 50 in North America and Europe are positive signs. China, although relatively stable during the first half of 2016, demonstrated strength during the second half of the year. Within China, we have seen a strengthening in orders that began during the second quarter and continued throughout the remainder of 2016, indicating strength within the transportation markets. Global forecasted production for light vehicles is expected to grow nominally in 2017, however production is expected to remain stable within the markets in which the Company operates. Within our Molding Solution businesses, North American and European markets remain healthy, while demand in Asia is more modest. For the Molding Solutions businesses in 2017, we anticipate favorable demand trends to continue within the medical and personal care hot runner markets and the packaging and medical mold markets. As noted above, our sales were negatively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currencies during 2016 of $9.6 million. To the extent that the U.S. dollar remains strong as compared with the other foreign currencies, our sales may continue to be unfavorably impacted by foreign currency relative to the prior year periods. The relative impact on operating profit is not expected to be as significant as the impact on sales as most of our businesses have expenses primarily denominated in local currencies, where their revenues reside. The Company also remains focused on sales growth through acquisition and expanding geographic reach. Strategic investments in new technologies, manufacturing processes and product development are expected to provide incremental benefits over the long term.\nOperating profit is largely dependent on the sales volumes and mix of the businesses in the segment. Management continues to focus on improving profitability and expanding margins through leveraging organic sales growth, acquisitions, pricing initiatives, global sourcing and productivity. Workforce reductions and facility consolidations initiated in 2015, combined with other productivity initiatives during 2016, contributed favorably throughout the year. We continue to evaluate market conditions and remain proactive in managing costs. Costs associated with new product and process introductions, productivity or restructuring initiatives, strategic investments and the integration of acquisitions may negatively impact operating profit.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nSales at Industrial were $782.3 million in 2015, a decrease of $39.8 million or 4.8% from 2014. The acquisitions of Thermoplay on August 7, 2015 and Priamus on October 1, 2015 provided sales of $13.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively, during the 2015 period. Organic sales increased by $13.5 million, or 1.6%, during 2015, primarily due to favorable end-markets served by our tool and die and plastics businesses during the first half of 2015. A softening within our transportation and general industrial end-markets during the second half of 2015 tempered a substantial portion of organic growth in the first half. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales by approximately $68.8 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies.\nOperating profit in 2015 at Industrial was $103.0 million, a decrease of 5.0% from 2014. Operating profit benefited primarily from the profit contribution of increased organic sales within our end markets during the first half of 2015, more than offset by lower productivity and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange during the full year. The 2015 period also included lump-sum pension settlement charges of $7.5 million that were allocated to the segment, short-term purchase adjustments and transaction costs resulting from the acquisitions of Thermoplay and Priamus of $1.9 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and $3.4 million of charges related to certain workforce reductions and restructuring. Lower sales volumes during the second half of 2015 tapered the benefit of growth in organic sales during the first half of the year. The 2014 period included $8.5 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the M\u00e4nner Business, whereas the 2015 period included $1.5 million of such adjustments. The 2014 period also included $6.0 million of pre-tax restructuring charges related to the closure of production operations at the facility in Saline, Michigan.\nAerospace\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>406.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>411.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>440.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 vs. 2015:\nAerospace recorded sales of $406.5 million in 2016, a 1.3% decrease from 2015. Lower sales within the original equipment manufacturing (\"OEM\") and spare parts businesses were partially offset by increased sales within the aftermarket maintenance repair and overhaul (\"MRO\") business. During the 2016 period, the segment continued to transition from the manufacture of components on legacy engine platforms to newer, more technologically advanced platforms. Lower volumes on the GE90 engine platform, as well as on other mature engine platforms, were partially offset by increased volume generated by newer programs within the OEM business. A decline in aftermarket spare parts was partially offset by a volume increase in the MRO business. Customer inventory management resulted in lower volumes within the spare parts business. Sales within the MRO business, although soft during the first half of the year, improved during the second half of 2016 as we obtained additional sales volume from existing customers. This business, however, continues to be impacted by airlines continuing to closely manage their aftermarket costs and as engine performance and quality has improved. Sales were not impacted by changes in foreign currency as sales within the segment are largely denominated in U.S. dollars.\nOperating profit at Aerospace decreased 4.5% from 2015 to $62.5 million. The operating profit decrease was primarily due to pricing deflation, the profit impact of lower volumes within the highly profitable spare parts business and unfavorable productivity, primarily a result of the transition from legacy engine platforms to newer, more advanced programs. Operating profit included a $1.4 million benefit from the contract termination arbitration award. Charges related to the contract termination dispute approximated $3.0 million and $2.8 million during the 2016 and 2015 periods, respectively. Operating profit in 2015 also included a lump-sum pension settlement charge of $2.4 million that was allocated to the segment and $0.8 million in workforce reduction and restructuring charges.\nOutlook:\nSales in the Aerospace OEM business are based on the general state of the aerospace market driven by the worldwide economy and are supported by its order backlog through participation in certain strategic commercial and military engine and airframe programs. Over the next several years, the Company expects strength in demand for new engines, driven by an expected increase in commercial aircraft production levels. The Company sees 2016 as having been a transition year for the Aerospace OEM business as it moves from declining production on some of its legacy engine programs onto the ramping of several new engine programs. Backlog at OEM was $626.3 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of 11.1% since December 31, 2015, at which time backlog was $563.9 million. Approximately 50% of OEM backlog is expected to ship in the next 12 months. The Aerospace OEM business may be impacted by changes in the content levels on certain platforms, changes in customer sourcing decisions, adjustments to customer inventory levels, commodity availability and pricing, changes in production schedules of specific engine and airframe programs, redesign of parts, quantity of parts per engine, cost schedules agreed to under contract with the engine manufacturers, as well as the pursuit and duration of new programs. Sales in the Aerospace aftermarket business may be impacted by fluctuations in end-market demand, inventory management and changes in customer sourcing, deferred or limited maintenance activity during engine shop visits and the use of surplus (used) material during the engine repair and overhaul process. End markets are expected to grow based on the long term underlying fundamentals of the aerospace industry. Management continues to believe its Aerospace aftermarket business is competitively positioned based on well-established long-term customer relationships, including maintenance and repair contracts in the MRO business and long-term Revenue Sharing Programs (\"RSPs\") and Component Repair Programs (\"CRPs\"), expanded capabilities and current capacity levels. Fluctuations in fuel costs and their impact on airline profitability and behaviors within the aerospace industry could impact levels and frequency of aircraft maintenance and overhaul activities, and airlines' decisions on maintaining, deferring or canceling new aircraft purchases, in part based on the value associated with new fuel efficient technologies.\nManagement is focused on growing operating profit at Aerospace primarily through leveraging organic sales growth, strategic investments, new product and process introductions, and productivity. Operating profit is expected to be affected by the impact of changes in sales volume, mix and pricing, particularly as they relate to the highly profitable aftermarket RSP\nspare parts business, and investments made in each of its businesses. During 2015, the Company responded to the challenging economic environment affecting certain of our Aerospace businesses. Workforce reductions and restructure charges were recorded following reduced aftermarket volumes and the impact of a customer's in-sourcing decision. Taking these actions supported our productivity initiatives and have begun to favorably impact segment results during 2016. Costs associated with new product and process introductions, the initial physical transfer of work to lower cost manufacturing regions, additional productivity initiatives and restructuring activities may also negatively impact operating profit.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nAerospace recorded sales of $411.7 million in 2015, a 6.4% decrease from 2014. Lower sales within the OEM and MRO businesses were partially offset by increased sales within the spare parts business. The spare parts business benefited from increased demand as a result of higher aircraft utilization and customer restocking of inventory, whereas the MRO business continued to be impacted by deferred maintenance on certain platforms. The timing of customer deliveries and execution, which was partially impacted by new product introduction challenges, in addition to the impact of a contract termination dispute, directly impacted lower sales within the OEM business during the second half of 2015. Sales were not impacted by changes in foreign currency as sales within the segment are largely denominated in U.S. dollars.\nOperating profit at Aerospace decreased 8.6% from 2014 to $65.4 million. The operating profit decrease was primarily due to the profit impact of lower sales within the OEM and MRO businesses, lump-sum pension settlement charges of $2.4 million that were allocated to the segment, $0.8 million in workforce reduction and restructuring charges, a $2.8 million charge that resulted from a contract termination dispute following a customer decision to re-source work and lower productivity. Partially offsetting these items were the higher profit impact of increased sales within the spare parts business and lower employee related costs, primarily incentive compensation, partially offset by higher pension costs.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nManagement assesses the Company's liquidity in terms of its overall ability to generate cash to fund its operating and investing activities. Of particular importance in the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditure levels, dividends, capital stock transactions, effective utilization of surplus cash positions overseas and adequate lines of credit.\nThe Company's ability to generate cash from operations in excess of its internal operating needs is one of its financial strengths. Management continues to focus on cash flow and working capital management, and anticipates that operating activities in 2017 will generate sufficient cash to fund operations. The Company closely monitors its cash generation, usage and preservation including the management of working capital to generate cash.\nOn October 15, 2014, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement ( Note Purchase Agreement\u201d), among the Company and New York Life Insurance Company, New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation and New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation Institutionally Owned Life Insurance Separate Account (BOLI 30C), as purchasers, for the issuance of $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.97% senior notes due October 17, 2024 (the 3.97% Senior Notes\u201d). The Company completed funding of the transaction and issued the 3.97% Senior Notes on October 17, 2014. The 3.97% Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and pays interest semi-annually on April 17 and October 17 of each year at an annual rate of 3.97%. The 3.97% Senior Notes will mature on October 17, 2024 unless earlier prepaid in accordance with their terms. Subject to certain conditions, the Company may, at its option, prepay all or any part of the 3.97% Senior Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 3.97% Senior Notes so prepaid, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of prepayment, plus the Make-Whole Amount, as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement, with respect to such principal amount being prepaid. The Note Purchase Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that are similar to the covenants required under the Amended Credit Agreement, as discussed below. At December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Note Purchase Agreement.\nDuring the second quarter of 2014, the 3.375% Convertible Notes (the \"3.375% Notes\") were eligible for conversion due to meeting their conversion price eligibility requirement. On June 16, 2014, $0.2 million of the 3.375% Notes (par value) were surrendered for conversion. On June 24, 2014, the Company exercised its right to redeem the remaining $55.4 million principal amount of the 3.375% Notes, effective July 31, 2014. The Company elected to pay cash to holders of the 3.375% Notes surrendered for conversion, including the value of any residual shares of common stock that might be payable to the holders electing to convert their 3.375% Notes into an equivalent share value. Under the terms of the indenture, the conversion value was measured based upon a 20-day valuation period of the Company's stock price. The Company used borrowings under its Amended Credit Facility to finance the redemption and conversion of the 3.375% Notes. The remaining 3.375% Notes were\nrendered for conversion during the third quarter of 2014 and the Company paid $70.5 million in cash to the holders, which included a premium of $14.9 million.\nIn September 2013, the Company entered into a second amendment to its fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement (the \"Amended Credit Agreement\u201d) and retained Bank of America, N.A. as the administrative agent for the lenders. The $750.0 million Amended Credit Agreement matures in September 2018. The Amended Credit Agreement adds a new foreign subsidiary borrower in Germany, Barnes Group Acquisition GmbH, and includes an accordion feature to increase the borrowing availability of the Company to $1,000.0 million. The Company may exercise the accordion feature upon request to the Administrative Agent as long as an event of default has not occurred or is continuing. The borrowing availability of $750.0 million, pursuant to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, allows for Euro-denominated borrowings equivalent to $500.0 million. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 1.10% to 1.70% depending on the Company's leverage ratio at prior quarter end. In October 2014, the Company entered into a third amendment to its fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement, which allowed for the issuance of the Note Purchase Agreement.\nThe Company's borrowing capacity was limited by various debt covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement (the \"Agreements\"). The Agreements require the Company to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Senior Debt, as defined in the Agreements, to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined, of not more than 3.25 times at the end of each fiscal quarter (\"Senior Debt Ratio\"), a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt, as defined, to Consolidated EBITDA of not more than 4.00 times at the end of each fiscal quarter, and a ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense, as defined, of not less than 4.25 times at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Agreements also provide that in connection with certain permitted acquisitions with aggregate consideration in excess of $150.0 million, the Consolidated Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio and the Consolidated Total Debt to EBITDA ratio are permitted to increase to 3.50 times and 4.25 times, respectively, for a period of the four fiscal quarters ending after the closing of the acquisition. At December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Agreements. The Company's most restrictive financial covenant is the Senior Debt Ratio which requires the Company to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Senior Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of not more than 3.25 times at December 31, 2016. The actual ratio at December 31, 2016 was 1.69 times.\nIn February 2017, the Company entered into the fourth amendment of its fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement (the the Fourth Amendment\u201d) and retained Bank of America, N.A as the Administrative Agent for the lenders. The Fourth Amendment increases the facility to $850.0 million and extends the maturity date to February 2022. The Fourth Amendment also increases the existing accordion feature, allowing the Company to request additional borrowings of up to $350.0 million. The Company may exercise the accordion feature upon request to the Administrative Agent as long as an event of default has not occurred or is not continuing. The borrowing availability of $850.0 million, pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Amendment, allow for multi-currency borrowing which includes euro, sterling or Swiss franc borrowing, up to $600.0 million. Depending on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio, and at the election of the Company, borrowings under the Fourth Amendment will bear interest at either LIBOR plus a margin of between 1.10% and 1.70% or the base rate plus a margin of 0.10% to 0.70%. The Fourth Amendment generally requires the Company to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Senior Debt, as defined, to Consolidated EBITDA of not more than 3.25 times, a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt, as defined, to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined, of not more than 3.75 times, and a ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense, as defined, of not less than 4.25 times, in each case at the end of each fiscal quarter; provided that these debt to EBITDA ratios are permitted to increase for a period of four fiscal quarters after the closing of certain permitted acquisitions.\nIn 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company acquired 0.6 million shares, 1.4 million shares and 0.2 million shares of the Company's common stock, respectively, at a cost of $20.5 million, $52.1 million and $8.4 million, respectively.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, the Company, through three of its subsidiaries (collectively, the Purchaser\u201d), completed its acquisition of the molds business of Adval Tech Holding AG and Adval Tech Holdings (Asia) Pte. Ltd. (\"FOBOHA\")(collectively, the Sellers\u201d). See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company acquired FOBOHA for an aggregate cash purchase price of CHF 136.3 million ($138.6 million) which was financed using cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. The purchase price includes preliminary adjustments under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\"), including approximately CHF 11.3 million ($11.5 million) related to cash acquired, and is subject to post closing adjustments under the terms of the SPA The aggregate purchase was paid using cash on hand of $68.5 million and borrowings of $70.1 million under the Company's revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2016, the Company had repaid $62.0 million of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility using cash generated from its foreign operations. In July 2016, the Company entered into forward contract agreements (CHF 133.0 million in aggregate) to reduce the exposure to foreign currency exchange rates on the purchase price. These forward contract agreements were subsequently settled in August 2016 and did not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nOperating cash flow may be supplemented with external borrowings to meet near-term business expansion needs and the Company's current financial commitments. The Company has assessed its credit facilities in conjunction with the Fourth Amendment of the Amended Credit Facility and currently expects that its bank syndicate, comprised of 14 banks, will continue to support its Amended Credit Agreement which matures in February 2022. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $386.7 million unused and available for borrowings under its then existing $750.0 million Amended Credit Facility, subject to covenants in the Company's debt agreements. At December 31, 2016, additional borrowings of $683.2 million of Total Debt and $461.2 million of Senior Debt would have been allowed under the financial covenants. The Company intends to use borrowings under its Amended Credit Facility to support the Company's ongoing growth initiatives. The Company believes its credit facilities and access to capital markets, coupled with cash generated from operations, are adequate for its anticipated future requirements.\nThe Company had $30.7 million in borrowings under short-term bank credit lines at December 31, 2016.\nIn 2012, the Company entered into five-year interest rate swap agreements transacted with three banks which together convert the interest on the first $100.0 million of borrowings under the Company's Credit Agreement from a variable rate plus the borrowing spread to a fixed rate of 1.03% plus the borrowing spread for the purpose of mitigating its exposure to variable interest rates. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company's total borrowings were comprised of 41% fixed rate debt and 59% variable rate debt.\nThe funded status of the Company's pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including actual rates of return that impact the fair value of pension assets and changes in discount rates that impact projected benefit obligations. The unfunded status of the pension plans increased from $65.7 million at December 31, 2015 to $77.0 million at December 31, 2016 as the increase in the projected benefit obligations (\"PBOs\") exceeded the increase in the fair value of the pension plan assets, following an update of certain actuarial assumptions. The Company recorded a $8.9 million non-cash after-tax decrease in stockholders equity (through other non-owner changes to equity) to record the current year adjustments for changes in the funded status of its pension and postretirement benefit plans as required under accounting for defined benefit and other postretirement plans. This decrease in stockholders equity resulted primarily from changes in actuarial assumptions, primarily the discount rate, and unfavorable variances between expected and actual returns on pension plan assets, offset by the amortization of actuarial losses recorded earlier. In 2016, as planned, the Company made $15.0 million in discretionary contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plans. The Company expects to contribute approximately $4.9 million to its various defined benefit pension plans in 2017. No discretionary contributions to the U.S. Qualified pension plans in 2017 are currently planned. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company held $66.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, the majority of which was held by foreign subsidiaries. These amounts have no material regulatory or contractual restrictions and are expected to primarily fund international investments. The Company repatriated $8.3 million of current year foreign earnings to the U.S. during 2016.\nAny future acquisitions are expected to be financed through internal cash, borrowings and equity, or a combination thereof. Additionally, we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\nCash Flow\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>217.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>217.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>196.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(179.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(115.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(124.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exchange rate effect\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(55.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________________\nNM - Not meaningful\nOperating activities provided $217.6 million in 2016 compared to $217.5 million in 2015. Operating cash flows in the 2016 period were positively impacted by improved operating performance as well as a reduction in outflows of accrued liabilities, including employee incentive compensation payments. Cash inflows in the 2016 period were partially offset by an\noutflow of $15.0 million related to discretionary contributions to the U.S. Qualified pension plans and were negatively impacted by an increase in receivables resulting from sales growth which generated a use of cash in 2016.\nInvesting activities used $179.5 million in cash in 2016 and $115.5 million in 2015. Investing activities in 2016 include a cash outflow of $127.1 million used to fund the FOBOHA acquisition compared to $52.0 million used to fund the Thermoplay and Priamus acquistions in 2015. Investing activities in 2016 also include a payment of $1.5 million related to the post-acquisition closing adjustment of Thermoplay. Payments related to the Component Repair Programs (\"CRPs\") were $4.1 million in 2016 compared to $21.0 million in 2015. See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital expenditures were $47.6 million in 2016 compared to $46.0 million in 2015. The Company expects capital spending in 2017 to approximate $55 million. Capital expenditures relate to both maintenance needs and support of growth initiatives, which include the purchase of equipment to support new products and services, and will be funded primarily through cash flows from operations.\nCash used by financing activities in 2016 included a net decrease in borrowings of $9.9 million compared to a net increase of $2.7 million in 2015. In 2016, the Company borrowed $100.0 million under the Amended Credit Facility through an international subsidiary. The proceeds were distributed to the Parent Company and subsequently used to pay down U.S. borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock were $4.6 million and $11.4 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2016, the Company repurchased 0.6 million shares of the Company's stock at a cost of $20.5 million, compared with the purchase of 1.4 million shares at a cost of $52.1 million in 2015. Total cash used to pay dividends increased slightly to $27.4 million in 2016 compared to $26.2 million in 2015. Withholding taxes paid on stock issuances in the 2016 and 2015 periods were $4.9 million and $4.9 million, respectively. Other financing cash flows during 2016 and 2015 include $5.2 million and $10.3 million, respectively, of net cash proceeds from the settlement of foreign currency hedges related to intercompany financings.\nDebt Covenants\nBorrowing capacity is limited by various debt covenants in the Company's debt agreements. As of December 31, 2016, the most restrictive financial covenant is included within the Amended Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement and requires the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Consolidated Senior Debt, as defined, to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined, of not more than 3.25 times for the four fiscal quarters then ending. The Agreements also contain other financial covenants that require the maintenance of a certain other debt ratio, Consolidated Total Debt, as defined, to Consolidated EBITDA of not more than 4.00 times and a certain interest coverage ratio, Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense, as defined, of at least 4.25 times, at December 31, 2016. The Agreements also provide that in connection with certain permitted acquisitions with aggregate consideration in excess of $150.0 million, the Consolidated Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio and the Consolidated Total Debt to EBITDA ratio are permitted to increase to 3.50 times and 4.25 times, respectively, for a period of the four fiscal quarters ending after the closing of the acquisition. Following is a reconciliation of Consolidated EBITDA to the Company's net income (in millions):\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income taxes\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>80.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment for non-cash stock based compensation\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Adjustment for acquired businesses\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of FOBOHA acquisition inventory step-up\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated EBITDA, as defined\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>296.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Senior Debt, as defined, as of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>501.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of Consolidated Senior Debt to Consolidated EBITDA\n</td> <td>1.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum\n</td> <td>3.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Total Debt, as defined, as of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>501.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA\n</td> <td>1.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Cash Interest Expense, as defined, as of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense\n</td> <td>22.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum\n</td> <td>4.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Amended Credit Agreement allows for certain adjustments within the calculation of the financial covenants. The adjustment for acquired businesses reflects the unaudited pre-acquisition operations of FOBOHA for the period from January 1, 2016 through August 31, 2016. Other adjustments consist primarily of net gains on the sale of assets and due diligence and transaction expenses as permitted under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company's financial covenants are measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2016, additional borrowings of $683.2 million of Total Debt and $461.2 million of Senior Debt would have been allowed under the covenants. Senior Debt includes primarily the borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility, the 3.97% Senior Notes and the borrowings under the lines of credit. The Company's unused committed credit facilities at December 31, 2016 were $386.7 million.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had the following contractual obligations and commitments:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>470.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest payments under long-term obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected pension contributions (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected benefit payments - other postretirement benefit plans (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>722.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>404.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Long-term debt obligations represent the required principal payments under such agreements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Interest payments under long-term debt obligations have been estimated based on the borrowings outstanding and market interest rates as of December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>The amounts do not include purchase obligations reflected as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

See Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOTHER MATTERS\nInflation\nInflation generally affects the Company through its costs of labor, equipment and raw materials. Increases in the costs of these items have historically been offset by price increases, commodity price escalator provisions, operating improvements, and other cost-saving initiatives.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below. Actual results could differ from such estimates.\nInventory Valuation: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or market. Provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value. Loss provisions, if any, on aerospace contracts are established when estimable. Loss provisions are based on the projected excess of manufacturing costs over the net revenues of the products or group of related products under contract or purchase order. The process for evaluating the value of excess and obsolete inventory often requires the Company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, access to applicable markets, quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future adjustments to these provisions.\nBusiness Acquisitions, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill: Assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $633.4 million and $42.8 million of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. Goodwill represents the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or earlier if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit may have been reduced below its carrying value. Management completes its annual impairment assessments for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the second quarter of each year. The Company uses the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative impairment tests in accordance with applicable accounting standards.\nUnder the qualitative goodwill assessment, management considers relevant events and circumstances including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall unit performance and events directly affecting a unit. If the Company determines that the two-step quantitative impairment test is required, management estimates the fair value of the reporting unit primarily using the income approach, which reflects management's cash flow projections, and also evaluates the fair value using the market approach. Inherent in management's development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates, including those related to future earnings and growth and the weighted average cost of capital. Based on the second quarter 2016 assessment, the estimated fair value of all reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values and there was no goodwill impairment at any of the reporting units. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods as a result of both Company-specific and overall economic conditions. Management's quantitative assessment during the second quarter of 2016 included a review of the potential impacts of current and projected market conditions from a market participant's perspective on reporting units' projected cash flows, growth rates and cost of capital to assess the likelihood of whether the fair value would be less than the carrying value. While management expects future operating improvements at certain reporting units to result from improving end-market conditions, new product introductions and further market penetration, there can be no assurance that such expectations will be met or that the fair value of the reporting units will continue to exceed their carrying values. If the fair values were to fall below the carrying values, a non-cash impairment charge to income from operations could result. Management also performed its annual impairment testing of its trade names, indefinite-lived intangible assets, during the second quarter of 2016. Based on this assessment, there was no trade name impairment recognized.\nAerospace Aftermarket Programs: The Company participates in aftermarket RSPs under which the Company receives an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program. As consideration, the Company has paid participation fees, which are recorded as intangible assets. The carrying value of these intangible assets was $198.0 million at December 31, 2016. The Company records amortization of the related asset as sales dollars are being earned based on a proportional sales dollar method. Specifically, this method amortizes each asset as a reduction to revenue based on the proportion of sales under a program in a given period to the estimated aggregate sales dollars over the life of that program which reflects the pattern in which economic benefits are realized.\nThe Company entered into Component Repair Programs (\"CRPs\") with General Electric (\"GE\") during the fourth quarter of 2013 (\"CRP 1\"), the second quarter of 2014 (\"CRP 2\") and the fourth quarter of 2015 (\"CRP 3\"). The CRPs provide for, among other items, the right to sell certain aftermarket component repair services for CFM56, CF6, CF34 and LM engines directly to other customers as one of a few GE licensed suppliers. In addition, the CRPs extend certain existing contracts under which the Company currently provides these services directly to GE. The Company agreed to pay $26.6 million, $80.0 million and $5.2 million as consideration for the rights related CRP1, CRP 2 and CRP 3, respectively. The Company recorded the CRP payments as an intangible asset which is recognized as a reduction of sales over the remaining life of these engine programs. This method reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the CRPs are realized.\nThe recoverability of each asset is subject to significant estimates about future revenues related to the programs' aftermarket parts and services. The Company evaluates these intangible assets for recoverability and updates amortization rates on an agreement by agreement basis for the RSPs and on an individual asset basis for the CRPs. The assets are reviewed for recoverability periodically including whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Annually, the Company evaluates the remaining life of these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Management updates revenue projections, which includes comparing actual experience against projected revenue and industry projections. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions, including, for example, the replacement of older engines with new, more fuel-efficient engines or the Company's ability to capture additional market share within the aftermarket business. A shortfall in future revenues may indicate a triggering event requiring a write down or further evaluation of the recoverability of the assets or require the Company to accelerate amortization expense prospectively dependent on the level of the shortfall. The Company has not identified any impairment of these assets. See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits: Accounting policies and significant assumptions related to pension and other postretirement benefits are disclosed in Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed further below, the significant assumptions that impact pension and other postretirement benefits include discount rates, mortality rates and expected long-term rates of return on invested pension assets.\nThe following table provides a breakout of the current targeted mix of investments, by asset classification, along with the historical rates of return for each asset class and the long-term projected rates of return for the U.S. plans.\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Target\nAsset\nMix %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annual Return %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Historical (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Long-\nTerm\nProjection\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset class\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. large cap growth equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. large cap value equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. mid cap equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. small cap - growth equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. small cap - value equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International Developed market equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Emerging market equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed income - long government credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed income - long credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________________\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Historical returns based on the life of the respective index, or approximately 30 years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe historical rates of return for the Company's defined benefit plans were calculated based upon compounded average rates of return of published indices.

The equity investment of 65% is more heavily on global equity investment targets, rather than U.S. targets. Based on the historical and projected rates of return of the weighted target asset mix, management selected a long-term expected rate of return on its U.S. pension assets of 7.75%. The long-term rates of return for non-U.S. plans were selected based on actual historical rates of return of published indices that were used to measure the plans' target asset allocations. Historical rates were then discounted to consider fluctuations in the historical rates as well as potential changes in the investment environment.\nThe discount rate used for the Company's U.S. pension plans reflects the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. At December 31, 2016, the Company selected a discount rate of 4.50% based on a bond matching model for its U.S. pension plans. Market interest rates have decreased in 2016 as compared with 2015 and, as a result, the discount rate used to measure pension liabilities decreased from 4.65% at December 31, 2015. The discount rates for non-U.S. plans were selected based on highly rated long-term bond indices and yield curves that match the duration of the plan's benefit obligations.\nA one-quarter percentage point change in the assumed long-term rate of return on the Company's U.S. pension plans as of December 31, 2016 would impact the Company's 2017 pre-tax income by approximately $0.8 million. A one-quarter percentage point decrease in the discount rate on the Company's U.S. pension plans as of December 31, 2016 would decrease the Company's 2017 pre-tax income by approximately $1.1 million. The Company reviews these and other assumptions at least annually.\nThe Company recorded a $8.9 million non-cash after-tax decrease in stockholders equity (through other non-owner changes to equity) to record the current year adjustments for changes in the funded status of its pension and postretirement benefit plans as required under accounting for defined benefit and other postretirement plans. This decrease in stockholders equity resulted primarily from changes in actuarial assumptions, primarily the discount rate, and unfavorable variances between expected and actual returns on pension plan assets, offset by the amortization of actuarial losses recorded earlier. During 2016, the fair value of the Company's pension plan assets increased by $21.5 million and the projected benefit obligation increased by $32.9 million. The change in the projected benefit obligation included a $17.5 million (pre-tax) increase due to actuarial losses resulting primarily from a change in the discount rates used to measure pension liabilities, an annual interest cost of $19.5 million and a liability transfer of $26.0 million related to the acquisition of FOBOHA on August 31, 2016. These increases were partially offset by $31.2 million in benefits paid. Changes to other actuarial assumptions in 2016 did not have a material impact on our stockholders equity or projected benefit obligation. Actual pre-tax gains on total pension plan assets were $20.3 million compared with an expected pre-tax return on pension assets of $30.3 million. Pension expense for 2017 is expected to increase from $5.6 million in 2016 to $7.7 million in 2017.\nIncome Taxes: As of December 31, 2016, the Company had recognized $25.4 million of deferred tax assets, net of valuation reserves. The realization of these benefits is dependent in part on the amount and timing of future taxable income in the jurisdictions where deferred tax assets reside. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax loss carryforwards or the proposed operating results indicate that realization is unlikely, a valuation allowance is provided. Management currently believes that sufficient taxable income should be earned in the future to realize deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowances recorded.\nThe valuation of deferred tax assets requires significant judgment. Management's assessment that the deferred tax assets will be realized represents its estimate of future results; however, there can be no assurance that such expectations will be met. Changes in management's assessment of achieving sufficient future taxable income could materially increase the Company's tax expense and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the Company is exposed to certain tax contingencies in the ordinary course of business and records those tax liabilities in accordance with the guidance for accounting for uncertain tax positions. For tax positions where the Company believes it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. For those income tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. See Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nStock-Based Compensation: The Company accounts for its stock-based employee compensation plans at fair value on the grant date and recognizes the related cost in its consolidated statement of income in accordance with accounting standards related to share-based payments. The fair values of stock options are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on certain assumptions. The fair values of service and performance based share awards are estimated based on the fair market value of the Company's stock price on the grant date. The fair values of market based performance share awards are estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation method. See Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecent Accounting Changes\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") amended its guidance related to revenue recognition. The amended guidance establishes a single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The amended guidance clarifies that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In applying the amended guidance, an entity will (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the contract's performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The amended guidance applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The amended guidance was initially effective for annual reporting periods (including interim periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2016 for public companies. Early adoption is not permitted. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved a deferral of the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017 for annual reporting periods beginning after that date. The FASB also proposed permitting early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach to the amended guidance. The Company currently anticipates adopting the amended guidance using the modified retrospective approach. We currently plan to adopt the amended guidance on January 1, 2018 at which time it becomes effective for the Company.\nIn 2015, we developed a project plan and established a cross-functional team to implement the amended guidance. We are currently reviewing our contracts and evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on each of our primary revenue streams. We expect to complete our evaluation of contracts in the first half of 2017. While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the amended guidance, we currently believe that the most significant impact relates to the timing of revenue recognition. We expect that a substantial portion of our businesses will continue to recognize revenue on a \"point-in-time basis\". We also expect, however, that a portion of our businesses with customized products will require the use of an \"over time\" recognition model as certain of our contracts may meet one or more of the mandatory criteria established in the amended guidance. In addition, we are in the process of identifying appropriate changes to our business processes, systems and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new standard. We expect to design any changes to such business processes, controls and systems by the middle of 2017 and implement the changes over the remainder of 2017.\nIn July 2015, the FASB amended its guidance related to the measurement of inventory. The amended guidance requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value and thereby simplifies the current guidance of measuring inventory at the lower of cost or market. The amended guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB amended its guidance related to lease accounting. The amended guidance requires lessees to recognize a majority of its leases on the balance sheet as a right-to-use asset. Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize an asset and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease expense will be recorded in a manner similar to current accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the guidance to determine the impact it will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company anticipates the amended guidance will have a material impact on its assets and liabilities due to the addition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities to the balance sheet; however, it does not expect the amended guidance to have a material impact on its cash flows or results of operations.\nIn August 2016, the FASB amended its guidance related to the Statement of Cash Flows. The amended guidance clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be presented on the statement of cash flows, with focus on eight specific areas in which cash flows have, in practice, been presented inconsistently. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the guidance to determine the impact it will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEBITDA\nEarnings before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) for 2016 was $274.7 million compared to $246.9 million in 2015. EBITDA is a measurement not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). The Company defines EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization which the Company incurs in the normal course of business. The Company does not intend EBITDA to represent\ncash flows from operations as defined by GAAP, and the reader should not consider it as an alternative to net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other items calculated in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance. The Company's definition of EBITDA may not be comparable with EBITDA as defined by other companies. The Company believes EBITDA is commonly used by financial analysts and others in the industries in which the Company operates and, thus, provides useful information to investors. Accordingly, the calculation has limitations depending on its use.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of EBITDA to the Company's net income (in millions):\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>246.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I could not understand your request because it seems to be incomplete or unclear.\n- Can you please provide additional information or clarification so that I can better assist you?\n- In the meantime, here are some general tips that may be helpful:\n\n- Begin by clearly stating your question or request, and try to provide as much detail as possible.\n- If you have specific requirements or constraints, be sure to include those as well.\n- If you have any supporting materials or resources that could assist in providing an answer, please share them.\n- It would also be helpful if you could let me know the purpose of your request or the goal you aim to achieve.\n- I will do my best to assist you once I have more information.\n\nIf you can provide additional details or clarification, I will be more than happy to assist you further.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences include those described in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report. We undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements.\nOVERVIEW\n2016 Highlights\nBarnes Group Inc. (the \"Company\") achieved sales of $1,230.8 million in 2016, an increase of $36.8 million, or 3.1%, from 2015. Acquired businesses contributed incremental sales of $47.4 million during 2016. Organic sales (net sales excluding both foreign currency and acquisition impacts) decreased by $1.1 million, or 0.1%, with an increase of 0.5% and a decrease of 1.3% within the Industrial and Aerospace segments, respectively. Sales in the Industrial segment were impacted by changes in foreign currency which decreased sales by approximately $9.6 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies.\nOperating income increased 14.1% from $168.4 million in 2015 to $192.2 million in 2016 and operating margin increased from 14.1% in 2015 to 15.6% in 2016. Operating income was impacted by improved productivity within Industrial and the profit contributions of the incremental sales generated at our recently acquired businesses, partially offset by unfavorable pricing within both segments. Operating income during 2016 and 2015 included $2.3 million and $2.6 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments, respectively, related to recent business acquisitions. Operating income in 2015 included a $9.9 million lump-sum pension settlement charge and $4.2 million of charges related to certain workforce reductions and restructuring charges.\nThe Company focused on profitable sales growth both organically and through acquisition, in addition to productivity improvements, as key strategic objectives in 2016. Management continued its focus on cash flow and working capital management in 2016 and generated $217.6 million in cash flow from operations.\nBusiness Transformation\nAcquisitions and strategic relationships with our customers have been a key growth driver for the Company, and we continue to seek alliances which foster long-term business relationships. These acquisitions have allowed us to extend into new or adjacent markets, expand our geographic reach, and commercialize new products, processes and services. The Company continually evaluates its business portfolio to optimize product offerings and maximize value. We have significantly transformed our business following our entrance into the plastic injection molding market.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, the Company, through three of its subsidiaries (collectively, the Purchaser\u201d), completed its acquisition of the molds business of Adval Tech Holding AG and Adval Tech Holdings (Asia) Pte. Ltd. (\"FOBOHA\"). FOBOHA is headquartered in Haslach, Germany and operates out of three manufacturing facilities located in Germany, Switzerland and China. The Company completed its purchase of the Germany and Switzerland businesses on August 31, 2016. The purchase of the China business required government approval which was granted on September 30, 2016. FOBOHA specializes in the development and manufacture of complex plastic injection molds for packaging, medical, consumer and automotive applications. The Company acquired FOBOHA for an aggregate cash purchase price of CHF 136.3 million ($138.6 million) which was financed using cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. The purchase price includes preliminary adjustments under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\"), including approximately CHF 11.3 million ($11.5 million) related to cash acquired, and is subject to post closing adjustments under the terms of the SPA. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded $39.8 million of intangible assets and $73.7 million of goodwill. See Note 2 and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company, itself and through two of its subsidiaries, completed the acquisition of privately held Priamus System Technologies AG and two of its subsidiaries (collectively, \"Priamus\") from Growth Finance AG. Priamus, which has approximately 40 employees, is headquartered in Schaffhausen, Switzerland and has direct sales and service offices in the U.S. and Germany. Priamus is a technology leader in the development of advanced process control systems for the plastic injection molding industry and services many of the world's highest quality plastic injection molders in the medical, automotive, consumer goods, electronics and packaging markets. Priamus has been integrated into our Industrial\nsegment. The Company acquired Priamus for an aggregate cash purchase price of CHF 9.9 million ($10.1 million) which was financed using cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. The purchase price includes adjustments under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, including CHF 1.6 million ($1.6 million) related to cash acquired. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the third quarter of 2015, the Company, through one of its subsidiaries, completed the acquisition of the Thermoplay business (\"Thermoplay\") by acquiring all of the capital stock of privately held HPE S.p.A., the parent company through which Thermoplay operates (\"HPE\"). Thermoplay's headquarters and manufacturing facility are located in Pont-Saint-Martin in Aosta, Italy, with technical service capabilities in China, India, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Portugal, and Brazil. Thermoplay, which has been integrated into our Industrial segment, specializes in the design, development, and manufacturing of hot runner solutions for plastic injection molding, primarily in the packaging, automotive, and medical end markets. The Company acquired Thermoplay for an aggregate cash purchase price of \u20ac58.1 million ($63.7 million), pursuant to the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\"), which was financed using cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. The purchase price includes adjustments under the terms of the SPA, including \u20ac17.1 million ($18.7 million) related to cash acquired. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement Objectives\nManagement focused on three key strategic enablers during 2016: deployment of the Barnes Enterprise System, accelerating innovation and maturing the talent management system, which, in combination, are expected to generate long-term value for the Company's stockholders and our customers. The Company's strategies for growth include both organic growth from new products, processes, systems, services, markets and customers, and growth from acquisitions. The Company's strategies for profitability include employee engagement and empowerment to drive productivity and process initiatives, such as the application of new technologies, automation and innovation, intensified focus on intellectual property as a core differentiator. A key component of the Company's culture is the Barnes Enterprise System (BES), the Company's operating system, which drives alignment and fosters continuous improvement, collaboration and innovation throughout the global organization.\nOur Business\nThe Company consists of two operating segments: Industrial and Aerospace.\nKey Performance Indicators\nManagement evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on the sales, operating profit, operating margins and cash generation of the respective businesses, which includes net sales, cost of sales, selling and administrative expenses and certain components of other income and other expenses, as well as the allocation of corporate overhead expenses. Each segment has standard key performance indicators ( KPIs\u201d), a number of which are focused on customer metrics (on-time-delivery and quality), internal effectiveness and productivity/efficiency metrics (sales effectiveness, global sourcing, operational excellence, functional excellence, sales per employee, cost of quality, and days working capital), employee safety-related metrics (total recordable incident rate and lost time incident rate), and specific KPIs on profitable growth.\nKey Industry Data\nIn both segments, management tracks a variety of economic and industry data as indicators of the health of a particular sector.\nAt Industrial, key data for the manufacturing operations include the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMI Composite Index (and similar indices for European and Asian-based businesses); the Federal Reserve's Industrial Production Index (\"the IPI\"); the Global Insight global medical and measuring equipment index; the production of light vehicles, both in the U.S. and globally; worldwide light vehicle new model introductions and existing model refreshes; North American medium and heavy duty vehicle production; and global GDP growth forecasts.\nAt Aerospace, management of the aftermarket business monitors the number of aircraft in the active fleet, the number of planes temporarily or permanently taken out of service, aircraft utilization rates for the major airlines, engine shop visits, airline profitability, aircraft fuel costs and traffic growth. The Aerospace OEM business regularly tracks orders and deliveries for each of the major aircraft manufacturers, as well as engine purchases made for new aircraft. Management also monitors annual appropriations for the U.S. military related to purchases of new or used aircraft and engine components.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSales\n\n2016 vs. 2015:\nThe Company reported net sales of $1,230.8 million in 2016, an increase of $36.8 million, or 3.1%, from 2015. Acquired businesses contributed incremental sales of $47.4 million during the 2016 period. Organic sales within Industrial increased by $4.1 million, or 0.5%, during 2016, primarily due to strength in our Molding Solutions businesses, slightly offset by continued softness in North American general industrial end-markets. Aerospace recorded sales of $406.5 million in 2016, a $5.2 million, or 1.3% decrease from 2015. Lower sales within the OEM and spare parts businesses were partially offset by increased sales within the MRO business. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales within Industrial by approximately $9.6 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies. Sales within Aerospace were not impacted by changes in foreign currency as these are largely denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company's international sales increased 10.4% year-over-year, while domestic sales decreased 4.7%, largely a result Aerospace sales being primarily U.S.-based. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on sales, however, the Company's international sales in 2016 increased 12.0%, inclusive of sales through acquisition, from 2015.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nThe Company reported net sales of $1,194.0 million in 2015, a decrease of $68.0 million, or 5.4%, from 2014. The acquisitions of Thermoplay on August 7, 2015 and Priamus on October 1, 2015 provided sales of $13.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively, during the 2015 period. Organic sales within Industrial increased by $13.5 million, or 1.6%, during 2015, primarily due to favorable end-markets served by our tool and die and plastics businesses during the first half of 2015. A softening within our transportation and general industrial end-markets during the second half of 2015 tempered a substantial portion of the organic growth in the first half of the year. Aerospace recorded sales of $411.7 million in 2015, a $28.3 million, or 6.4% decrease from 2014. Lower sales within the OEM and MRO businesses were partially offset by increased sales within the spare parts business. The spare parts business benefited from increased demand as a result of higher aircraft utilization and customer restocking of inventory, whereas the MRO business continued to be impacted by deferred maintenance on certain platforms. The timing of customer deliveries and execution, which was partially impacted by new product introduction challenges, in addition to the impact of a contract termination dispute, directly impacted lower sales within the OEM business during the second half of 2015. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales within Industrial by approximately $68.8 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies. Sales within Aerospace were not impacted by changes in foreign currency as these are largely denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company's international sales decreased 2.4% year-over-year, while domestic sales decreased 4.7%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on sales, however, the Company's international sales in 2015 increased 7.8%, inclusive of sales through acquisition, from 2014.\nExpenses and Operating Income\n\n (1) Sales less cost of sales \n2016 vs. 2015:\nCost of sales in 2016 increased 1.0% from 2015, while gross profit margin increased from 34.4% in 2015 to 35.8% in 2016. Gross margins improved at Industrial and decreased at Aerospace. Gross margin during the comparable 2015 period included a charge of $6.4 million related to a lump-sum pension settlement charge (see Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). At Industrial, gross profit increased during 2016 primarily as a result of favorable productivity and strength within the Molding Solutions businesses. Gross profit during 2016 was negatively impacted by $2.3 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of FOBOHA, whereas the 2015 period included $0.9 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the M\u00e4nner business and $0.9 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of Thermoplay. Within Aerospace, a decline in gross profit relates primarily to lower sales volumes and unfavorable productivity. Selling and administrative expenses in 2016 increased 2.3% from the 2015 period, due in part to $3.0 million of costs related to the contract termination dispute within the Aerospace segment and the incremental operations of the acquired businesses, partially offset by an $0.8 million reduction in short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to acquisitions. During the 2015 period, selling and administrative expenses included $4.2 million of charges related to workforce reductions and severance, and $3.5 million of lump-sum pension settlement charges. Short-term purchase accounting adjustments that impact selling and administrative expenses during 2015 included $0.6 million and $0.3 million related to the acquisitions of M\u00e4nner and Thermoplay, respectively. As a percentage of sales, selling and administrative costs decreased slightly from 20.3% in the 2015 period to 20.2% in the 2016 period. Operating income in the 2016 period increased 14.1% to $192.2 million from 2015 and operating income margin increased from 14.1% to 15.6%.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nCost of sales in 2015 decreased 5.6% from 2014, while gross profit margin increased slightly from 34.3% in 2014 to 34.4% in 2015. Gross margins remained flat at Industrial and improved slightly at Aerospace, however a higher percentage of sales were driven by the Industrial segment in 2015. The gross profit decrease during 2015 includes a charge of $6.4 million related to a lump-sum pension settlement (see Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). At Industrial, gross profit during 2014 was partially offset by $4.5 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the M\u00e4nner business and restructuring charges of $5.4 million related to the closure of the Saline facility, which was completed in 2014. During 2015, short term purchase accounting adjustments of $0.9 million and $0.9 million were related to the acquisitions of the M\u00e4nner business and Thermoplay, respectively. Within Aerospace, gross profit declined as a result lower sales within OEM, partially offset by increased profits within the spare parts business, and a $2.8 million charge related to a contract termination dispute following a customer decision to re-source. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 3.8% from 2014 due primarily to foreign exchange translation and a $3.4 million reduction in the short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the M\u00e4nner business. Lower employee related expenses, primarily from incentive compensation, reduced selling and administrative expenses during the 2015 period. The 2014 period also included $0.6 million of charges related to the closure of the Saline facility. These expense reductions during 2015 were partially offset by $4.2 million of charges related to workforce reductions and severance, $3.5 million of lump-sum pension settlement charges and $0.3 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of Thermoplay. As a percentage of sales, selling and administrative costs increased from 20.0% in 2014 to 20.3% in 2015. Operating margin was 14.1% in 2015 compared to 14.3% in 2014.\nInterest expense\n2016 vs. 2015:\nInterest expense in 2016 increased $1.2 million to $11.9 million from 2015, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nInterest expense in 2015 decreased $0.7 million to $10.7 million from 2014, primarily as a result of lower average borrowings, partially offset by higher average borrowing rates resulting from the 3.97% Senior Notes that were issued under the Note Purchase Agreement executed on October 15, 2014. See Liquidity and Capital Resources within Item 7.\nOther expense (income), net\n2016 vs. 2015:\nOther expense (income), net in 2016 was $(2.3) million compared to $(0.2) million in 2015. Foreign currency gains of $1.9 million in the 2016 period compared with gains of $0.5 million in the 2015 period. Interest income of $2.3 million in 2016 compared with interest income of $1.0 million during 2015, with the increase being primarily attributed to the $1.4 million of interest income resulting from the Triumph arbitration award. See Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nOther expense (income), net in 2015 was $(0.2) million compared to $2.1 million in 2014. Foreign currency gains of $0.5 million in the 2015 period compared with foreign currency losses of $1.5 million in the 2014 period.\nIncome Taxes\n2016 vs. 2015:\nThe Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations was 25.7% in 2016 compared with 23.2% in 2015. The increase in the 2016 effective tax rate from continuing operations is primarily due to the expiration of certain tax holidays, the absence of the 2015 refund of withholding taxes and the change in the mix of earnings attributable to higher-taxing jurisdictions, partially offset by lower repatriation of a portion of current year foreign earnings to the U.S and the excess tax benefit on stock awards, reflecting the amended guidance related to share-based payments made to employees. See Note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2016, the Company repatriated a dividend from a portion of the current year foreign earnings to the U.S. in the amount of $8.3 million compared to $19.5 million in 2015. The decrease in the dividend decreased tax expense by $3.9 million and decreased the annual effective tax rate by 2.2 percentage points compared to 2015.\nIn 2017, the Company expects the effective tax rate from continuing operations to increase to between 27% and 28% primarily due to the absence of any excess tax benefit on stock awards and the expiration of certain foreign tax holidays.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nThe Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations was 23.2% in 2015 compared with 27.6% in 2014. The decrease in 2015 is primarily due to a tax refund of withholding taxes, the granting of an extended tax holiday in China as well as a change in the mix of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions offset by an increase in the repatriation of a portion of current year foreign earnings to the U.S. During 2015, the Company repatriated a dividend from a portion of the current year foreign earnings to the U.S. in the amount of $19.5 million compared to $12.5 million in 2014. The increase in the dividend increased tax expense by $2.4 million and increased the annual effective tax rate by 1.5 percentage points compared to 2014.\nSee Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the consolidated effective income tax rate.\nIncome and Income Per Share\n\nBasic and diluted income from continuing operations per common share increased for 2016 as compared to 2015, consistent with the changes in income from continuing operations year over year. Basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding decreased due to the repurchase of 1,352,596 and 550,994 shares during 2015 and 2016, respectively, as part of the Company's repurchase program. The impact of the repurchased shares was partially offset by the issuance of shares for employee stock plans.\nFinancial Performance by Business Segment\nIndustrial\n\n2016 vs. 2015:\nSales at Industrial were $824.2 million in 2016, an increase of $41.9 million, or 5.4%, from 2015. Acquired businesses contributed incremental sales of $47.4 million during the 2016 period. Organic sales increased by $4.1 million, or 0.5%, during 2016, driven primarily by strength in our Molding Solutions businesses, slightly offset by continued softness in North American general industrial end-markets. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales by approximately $9.6 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies.\nOperating profit in 2016 at Industrial was $129.7 million, an increase of 26.0% from 2015. The increase was driven by favorable productivity, as the Company continued its focus on manufacturing efficiencies and improved supply chain management across multiple units, and the profit contributions of acquired businesses, partially offset by lower pricing. The 2015 period included $3.6 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments and transaction costs related to business acquisitions, whereas the acquisition of FOBOHA during the 2016 period resulted in $3.5 million of such costs. The 2015 period also included lump-sum pension settlement charges of $7.5 million that were allocated to the segment and $3.4 million of charges related to certain workforce reductions and restructuring.\nOutlook:\nIn Industrial, management is focused on generating organic sales growth through the introduction of new products and by leveraging the benefits of the diversified products and industrial end-markets in which its businesses have a global presence. Our ability to generate sales growth is subject to economic conditions in the global markets served by all of our businesses. For general industrial end-markets, manufacturing Purchasing Managers Indexes (\"PMIs\") above 50 in North America and Europe are positive signs. China, although relatively stable during the first half of 2016, demonstrated strength during the second half of the year. Within China, we have seen a strengthening in orders that began during the second quarter and continued throughout the remainder of 2016, indicating strength within the transportation markets. Global forecasted production for light vehicles is expected to grow nominally in 2017, however production is expected to remain stable within the markets in which the Company operates. Within our Molding Solution businesses, North American and European markets remain healthy, while demand in Asia is more modest. For the Molding Solutions businesses in 2017, we anticipate favorable demand trends to continue within the medical and personal care hot runner markets and the packaging and medical mold markets. As noted above, our sales were negatively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currencies during 2016 of $9.6 million. To the extent that the U.S. dollar remains strong as compared with the other foreign currencies, our sales may continue to be unfavorably impacted by foreign currency relative to the prior year periods. The relative impact on operating profit is not expected to be as significant as the impact on sales as most of our businesses have expenses primarily denominated in local currencies, where their revenues reside. The Company also remains focused on sales growth through acquisition and expanding geographic reach. Strategic investments in new technologies, manufacturing processes and product development are expected to provide incremental benefits over the long term.\nOperating profit is largely dependent on the sales volumes and mix of the businesses in the segment. Management continues to focus on improving profitability and expanding margins through leveraging organic sales growth, acquisitions, pricing initiatives, global sourcing and productivity. Workforce reductions and facility consolidations initiated in 2015, combined with other productivity initiatives during 2016, contributed favorably throughout the year. We continue to evaluate market conditions and remain proactive in managing costs. Costs associated with new product and process introductions, productivity or restructuring initiatives, strategic investments and the integration of acquisitions may negatively impact operating profit.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nSales at Industrial were $782.3 million in 2015, a decrease of $39.8 million or 4.8% from 2014. The acquisitions of Thermoplay on August 7, 2015 and Priamus on October 1, 2015 provided sales of $13.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively, during the 2015 period. Organic sales increased by $13.5 million, or 1.6%, during 2015, primarily due to favorable end-markets served by our tool and die and plastics businesses during the first half of 2015. A softening within our transportation and general industrial end-markets during the second half of 2015 tempered a substantial portion of organic growth in the first half. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales by approximately $68.8 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies.\nOperating profit in 2015 at Industrial was $103.0 million, a decrease of 5.0% from 2014. Operating profit benefited primarily from the profit contribution of increased organic sales within our end markets during the first half of 2015, more than offset by lower productivity and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange during the full year. The 2015 period also included lump-sum pension settlement charges of $7.5 million that were allocated to the segment, short-term purchase adjustments and transaction costs resulting from the acquisitions of Thermoplay and Priamus of $1.9 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and $3.4 million of charges related to certain workforce reductions and restructuring. Lower sales volumes during the second half of 2015 tapered the benefit of growth in organic sales during the first half of the year. The 2014 period included $8.5 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the M\u00e4nner Business, whereas the 2015 period included $1.5 million of such adjustments. The 2014 period also included $6.0 million of pre-tax restructuring charges related to the closure of production operations at the facility in Saline, Michigan.\nAerospace\n\n2016 vs. 2015:\nAerospace recorded sales of $406.5 million in 2016, a 1.3% decrease from 2015. Lower sales within the original equipment manufacturing (\"OEM\") and spare parts businesses were partially offset by increased sales within the aftermarket maintenance repair and overhaul (\"MRO\") business. During the 2016 period, the segment continued to transition from the manufacture of components on legacy engine platforms to newer, more technologically advanced platforms. Lower volumes on the GE90 engine platform, as well as on other mature engine platforms, were partially offset by increased volume generated by newer programs within the OEM business. A decline in aftermarket spare parts was partially offset by a volume increase in the MRO business. Customer inventory management resulted in lower volumes within the spare parts business. Sales within the MRO business, although soft during the first half of the year, improved during the second half of 2016 as we obtained additional sales volume from existing customers. This business, however, continues to be impacted by airlines continuing to closely manage their aftermarket costs and as engine performance and quality has improved. Sales were not impacted by changes in foreign currency as sales within the segment are largely denominated in U.S. dollars.\nOperating profit at Aerospace decreased 4.5% from 2015 to $62.5 million. The operating profit decrease was primarily due to pricing deflation, the profit impact of lower volumes within the highly profitable spare parts business and unfavorable productivity, primarily a result of the transition from legacy engine platforms to newer, more advanced programs. Operating profit included a $1.4 million benefit from the contract termination arbitration award. Charges related to the contract termination dispute approximated $3.0 million and $2.8 million during the 2016 and 2015 periods, respectively. Operating profit in 2015 also included a lump-sum pension settlement charge of $2.4 million that was allocated to the segment and $0.8 million in workforce reduction and restructuring charges.\nOutlook:\nSales in the Aerospace OEM business are based on the general state of the aerospace market driven by the worldwide economy and are supported by its order backlog through participation in certain strategic commercial and military engine and airframe programs. Over the next several years, the Company expects strength in demand for new engines, driven by an expected increase in commercial aircraft production levels. The Company sees 2016 as having been a transition year for the Aerospace OEM business as it moves from declining production on some of its legacy engine programs onto the ramping of several new engine programs. Backlog at OEM was $626.3 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of 11.1% since December 31, 2015, at which time backlog was $563.9 million. Approximately 50% of OEM backlog is expected to ship in the next 12 months. The Aerospace OEM business may be impacted by changes in the content levels on certain platforms, changes in customer sourcing decisions, adjustments to customer inventory levels, commodity availability and pricing, changes in production schedules of specific engine and airframe programs, redesign of parts, quantity of parts per engine, cost schedules agreed to under contract with the engine manufacturers, as well as the pursuit and duration of new programs. Sales in the Aerospace aftermarket business may be impacted by fluctuations in end-market demand, inventory management and changes in customer sourcing, deferred or limited maintenance activity during engine shop visits and the use of surplus (used) material during the engine repair and overhaul process. End markets are expected to grow based on the long term underlying fundamentals of the aerospace industry. Management continues to believe its Aerospace aftermarket business is competitively positioned based on well-established long-term customer relationships, including maintenance and repair contracts in the MRO business and long-term Revenue Sharing Programs (\"RSPs\") and Component Repair Programs (\"CRPs\"), expanded capabilities and current capacity levels. Fluctuations in fuel costs and their impact on airline profitability and behaviors within the aerospace industry could impact levels and frequency of aircraft maintenance and overhaul activities, and airlines' decisions on maintaining, deferring or canceling new aircraft purchases, in part based on the value associated with new fuel efficient technologies.\nManagement is focused on growing operating profit at Aerospace primarily through leveraging organic sales growth, strategic investments, new product and process introductions, and productivity. Operating profit is expected to be affected by the impact of changes in sales volume, mix and pricing, particularly as they relate to the highly profitable aftermarket RSP\nspare parts business, and investments made in each of its businesses. During 2015, the Company responded to the challenging economic environment affecting certain of our Aerospace businesses. Workforce reductions and restructure charges were recorded following reduced aftermarket volumes and the impact of a customer's in-sourcing decision. Taking these actions supported our productivity initiatives and have begun to favorably impact segment results during 2016. Costs associated with new product and process introductions, the initial physical transfer of work to lower cost manufacturing regions, additional productivity initiatives and restructuring activities may also negatively impact operating profit.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nAerospace recorded sales of $411.7 million in 2015, a 6.4% decrease from 2014. Lower sales within the OEM and MRO businesses were partially offset by increased sales within the spare parts business. The spare parts business benefited from increased demand as a result of higher aircraft utilization and customer restocking of inventory, whereas the MRO business continued to be impacted by deferred maintenance on certain platforms. The timing of customer deliveries and execution, which was partially impacted by new product introduction challenges, in addition to the impact of a contract termination dispute, directly impacted lower sales within the OEM business during the second half of 2015. Sales were not impacted by changes in foreign currency as sales within the segment are largely denominated in U.S. dollars.\nOperating profit at Aerospace decreased 8.6% from 2014 to $65.4 million. The operating profit decrease was primarily due to the profit impact of lower sales within the OEM and MRO businesses, lump-sum pension settlement charges of $2.4 million that were allocated to the segment, $0.8 million in workforce reduction and restructuring charges, a $2.8 million charge that resulted from a contract termination dispute following a customer decision to re-source work and lower productivity. Partially offsetting these items were the higher profit impact of increased sales within the spare parts business and lower employee related costs, primarily incentive compensation, partially offset by higher pension costs.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nManagement assesses the Company's liquidity in terms of its overall ability to generate cash to fund its operating and investing activities. Of particular importance in the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditure levels, dividends, capital stock transactions, effective utilization of surplus cash positions overseas and adequate lines of credit.\nThe Company's ability to generate cash from operations in excess of its internal operating needs is one of its financial strengths. Management continues to focus on cash flow and working capital management, and anticipates that operating activities in 2017 will generate sufficient cash to fund operations. The Company closely monitors its cash generation, usage and preservation including the management of working capital to generate cash.\nOn October 15, 2014, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement ( Note Purchase Agreement\u201d), among the Company and New York Life Insurance Company, New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation and New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation Institutionally Owned Life Insurance Separate Account (BOLI 30C), as purchasers, for the issuance of $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.97% senior notes due October 17, 2024 (the 3.97% Senior Notes\u201d). The Company completed funding of the transaction and issued the 3.97% Senior Notes on October 17, 2014. The 3.97% Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and pays interest semi-annually on April 17 and October 17 of each year at an annual rate of 3.97%. The 3.97% Senior Notes will mature on October 17, 2024 unless earlier prepaid in accordance with their terms. Subject to certain conditions, the Company may, at its option, prepay all or any part of the 3.97% Senior Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 3.97% Senior Notes so prepaid, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of prepayment, plus the Make-Whole Amount, as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement, with respect to such principal amount being prepaid. The Note Purchase Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that are similar to the covenants required under the Amended Credit Agreement, as discussed below. At December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Note Purchase Agreement.\nDuring the second quarter of 2014, the 3.375% Convertible Notes (the \"3.375% Notes\") were eligible for conversion due to meeting their conversion price eligibility requirement. On June 16, 2014, $0.2 million of the 3.375% Notes (par value) were surrendered for conversion. On June 24, 2014, the Company exercised its right to redeem the remaining $55.4 million principal amount of the 3.375% Notes, effective July 31, 2014. The Company elected to pay cash to holders of the 3.375% Notes surrendered for conversion, including the value of any residual shares of common stock that might be payable to the holders electing to convert their 3.375% Notes into an equivalent share value. Under the terms of the indenture, the conversion value was measured based upon a 20-day valuation period of the Company's stock price. The Company used borrowings under its Amended Credit Facility to finance the redemption and conversion of the 3.375% Notes. The remaining 3.375% Notes were\nrendered for conversion during the third quarter of 2014 and the Company paid $70.5 million in cash to the holders, which included a premium of $14.9 million.\nIn September 2013, the Company entered into a second amendment to its fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement (the \"Amended Credit Agreement\u201d) and retained Bank of America, N.A. as the administrative agent for the lenders. The $750.0 million Amended Credit Agreement matures in September 2018. The Amended Credit Agreement adds a new foreign subsidiary borrower in Germany, Barnes Group Acquisition GmbH, and includes an accordion feature to increase the borrowing availability of the Company to $1,000.0 million. The Company may exercise the accordion feature upon request to the Administrative Agent as long as an event of default has not occurred or is continuing. The borrowing availability of $750.0 million, pursuant to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, allows for Euro-denominated borrowings equivalent to $500.0 million. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 1.10% to 1.70% depending on the Company's leverage ratio at prior quarter end. In October 2014, the Company entered into a third amendment to its fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement, which allowed for the issuance of the Note Purchase Agreement.\nThe Company's borrowing capacity was limited by various debt covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement (the \"Agreements\"). The Agreements require the Company to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Senior Debt, as defined in the Agreements, to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined, of not more than 3.25 times at the end of each fiscal quarter (\"Senior Debt Ratio\"), a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt, as defined, to Consolidated EBITDA of not more than 4.00 times at the end of each fiscal quarter, and a ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense, as defined, of not less than 4.25 times at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Agreements also provide that in connection with certain permitted acquisitions with aggregate consideration in excess of $150.0 million, the Consolidated Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio and the Consolidated Total Debt to EBITDA ratio are permitted to increase to 3.50 times and 4.25 times, respectively, for a period of the four fiscal quarters ending after the closing of the acquisition. At December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Agreements. The Company's most restrictive financial covenant is the Senior Debt Ratio which requires the Company to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Senior Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of not more than 3.25 times at December 31, 2016. The actual ratio at December 31, 2016 was 1.69 times.\nIn February 2017, the Company entered into the fourth amendment of its fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement (the the Fourth Amendment\u201d) and retained Bank of America, N.A as the Administrative Agent for the lenders. The Fourth Amendment increases the facility to $850.0 million and extends the maturity date to February 2022. The Fourth Amendment also increases the existing accordion feature, allowing the Company to request additional borrowings of up to $350.0 million. The Company may exercise the accordion feature upon request to the Administrative Agent as long as an event of default has not occurred or is not continuing. The borrowing availability of $850.0 million, pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Amendment, allow for multi-currency borrowing which includes euro, sterling or Swiss franc borrowing, up to $600.0 million. Depending on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio, and at the election of the Company, borrowings under the Fourth Amendment will bear interest at either LIBOR plus a margin of between 1.10% and 1.70% or the base rate plus a margin of 0.10% to 0.70%. The Fourth Amendment generally requires the Company to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Senior Debt, as defined, to Consolidated EBITDA of not more than 3.25 times, a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt, as defined, to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined, of not more than 3.75 times, and a ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense, as defined, of not less than 4.25 times, in each case at the end of each fiscal quarter; provided that these debt to EBITDA ratios are permitted to increase for a period of four fiscal quarters after the closing of certain permitted acquisitions.\nIn 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company acquired 0.6 million shares, 1.4 million shares and 0.2 million shares of the Company's common stock, respectively, at a cost of $20.5 million, $52.1 million and $8.4 million, respectively.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, the Company, through three of its subsidiaries (collectively, the Purchaser\u201d), completed its acquisition of the molds business of Adval Tech Holding AG and Adval Tech Holdings (Asia) Pte. Ltd. (\"FOBOHA\")(collectively, the Sellers\u201d). See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company acquired FOBOHA for an aggregate cash purchase price of CHF 136.3 million ($138.6 million) which was financed using cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. The purchase price includes preliminary adjustments under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\"), including approximately CHF 11.3 million ($11.5 million) related to cash acquired, and is subject to post closing adjustments under the terms of the SPA The aggregate purchase was paid using cash on hand of $68.5 million and borrowings of $70.1 million under the Company's revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2016, the Company had repaid $62.0 million of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility using cash generated from its foreign operations. In July 2016, the Company entered into forward contract agreements (CHF 133.0 million in aggregate) to reduce the exposure to foreign currency exchange rates on the purchase price. These forward contract agreements were subsequently settled in August 2016 and did not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nOperating cash flow may be supplemented with external borrowings to meet near-term business expansion needs and the Company's current financial commitments. The Company has assessed its credit facilities in conjunction with the Fourth Amendment of the Amended Credit Facility and currently expects that its bank syndicate, comprised of 14 banks, will continue to support its Amended Credit Agreement which matures in February 2022. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $386.7 million unused and available for borrowings under its then existing $750.0 million Amended Credit Facility, subject to covenants in the Company's debt agreements. At December 31, 2016, additional borrowings of $683.2 million of Total Debt and $461.2 million of Senior Debt would have been allowed under the financial covenants. The Company intends to use borrowings under its Amended Credit Facility to support the Company's ongoing growth initiatives. The Company believes its credit facilities and access to capital markets, coupled with cash generated from operations, are adequate for its anticipated future requirements.\nThe Company had $30.7 million in borrowings under short-term bank credit lines at December 31, 2016.\nIn 2012, the Company entered into five-year interest rate swap agreements transacted with three banks which together convert the interest on the first $100.0 million of borrowings under the Company's Credit Agreement from a variable rate plus the borrowing spread to a fixed rate of 1.03% plus the borrowing spread for the purpose of mitigating its exposure to variable interest rates. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company's total borrowings were comprised of 41% fixed rate debt and 59% variable rate debt.\nThe funded status of the Company's pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including actual rates of return that impact the fair value of pension assets and changes in discount rates that impact projected benefit obligations. The unfunded status of the pension plans increased from $65.7 million at December 31, 2015 to $77.0 million at December 31, 2016 as the increase in the projected benefit obligations (\"PBOs\") exceeded the increase in the fair value of the pension plan assets, following an update of certain actuarial assumptions. The Company recorded a $8.9 million non-cash after-tax decrease in stockholders equity (through other non-owner changes to equity) to record the current year adjustments for changes in the funded status of its pension and postretirement benefit plans as required under accounting for defined benefit and other postretirement plans. This decrease in stockholders equity resulted primarily from changes in actuarial assumptions, primarily the discount rate, and unfavorable variances between expected and actual returns on pension plan assets, offset by the amortization of actuarial losses recorded earlier. In 2016, as planned, the Company made $15.0 million in discretionary contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plans. The Company expects to contribute approximately $4.9 million to its various defined benefit pension plans in 2017. No discretionary contributions to the U.S. Qualified pension plans in 2017 are currently planned. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company held $66.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, the majority of which was held by foreign subsidiaries. These amounts have no material regulatory or contractual restrictions and are expected to primarily fund international investments. The Company repatriated $8.3 million of current year foreign earnings to the U.S. during 2016.\nAny future acquisitions are expected to be financed through internal cash, borrowings and equity, or a combination thereof. Additionally, we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\nCash Flow\n\n________________________\nNM - Not meaningful\nOperating activities provided $217.6 million in 2016 compared to $217.5 million in 2015. Operating cash flows in the 2016 period were positively impacted by improved operating performance as well as a reduction in outflows of accrued liabilities, including employee incentive compensation payments. Cash inflows in the 2016 period were partially offset by an\noutflow of $15.0 million related to discretionary contributions to the U.S. Qualified pension plans and were negatively impacted by an increase in receivables resulting from sales growth which generated a use of cash in 2016.\nInvesting activities used $179.5 million in cash in 2016 and $115.5 million in 2015. Investing activities in 2016 include a cash outflow of $127.1 million used to fund the FOBOHA acquisition compared to $52.0 million used to fund the Thermoplay and Priamus acquistions in 2015. Investing activities in 2016 also include a payment of $1.5 million related to the post-acquisition closing adjustment of Thermoplay. Payments related to the Component Repair Programs (\"CRPs\") were $4.1 million in 2016 compared to $21.0 million in 2015. See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital expenditures were $47.6 million in 2016 compared to $46.0 million in 2015. The Company expects capital spending in 2017 to approximate $55 million. Capital expenditures relate to both maintenance needs and support of growth initiatives, which include the purchase of equipment to support new products and services, and will be funded primarily through cash flows from operations.\nCash used by financing activities in 2016 included a net decrease in borrowings of $9.9 million compared to a net increase of $2.7 million in 2015. In 2016, the Company borrowed $100.0 million under the Amended Credit Facility through an international subsidiary. The proceeds were distributed to the Parent Company and subsequently used to pay down U.S. borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock were $4.6 million and $11.4 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2016, the Company repurchased 0.6 million shares of the Company's stock at a cost of $20.5 million, compared with the purchase of 1.4 million shares at a cost of $52.1 million in 2015. Total cash used to pay dividends increased slightly to $27.4 million in 2016 compared to $26.2 million in 2015. Withholding taxes paid on stock issuances in the 2016 and 2015 periods were $4.9 million and $4.9 million, respectively. Other financing cash flows during 2016 and 2015 include $5.2 million and $10.3 million, respectively, of net cash proceeds from the settlement of foreign currency hedges related to intercompany financings.\nDebt Covenants\nBorrowing capacity is limited by various debt covenants in the Company's debt agreements. As of December 31, 2016, the most restrictive financial covenant is included within the Amended Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement and requires the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Consolidated Senior Debt, as defined, to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined, of not more than 3.25 times for the four fiscal quarters then ending. The Agreements also contain other financial covenants that require the maintenance of a certain other debt ratio, Consolidated Total Debt, as defined, to Consolidated EBITDA of not more than 4.00 times and a certain interest coverage ratio, Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense, as defined, of at least 4.25 times, at December 31, 2016. The Agreements also provide that in connection with certain permitted acquisitions with aggregate consideration in excess of $150.0 million, the Consolidated Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio and the Consolidated Total Debt to EBITDA ratio are permitted to increase to 3.50 times and 4.25 times, respectively, for a period of the four fiscal quarters ending after the closing of the acquisition. Following is a reconciliation of Consolidated EBITDA to the Company's net income (in millions):\n\nThe Amended Credit Agreement allows for certain adjustments within the calculation of the financial covenants. The adjustment for acquired businesses reflects the unaudited pre-acquisition operations of FOBOHA for the period from January 1, 2016 through August 31, 2016. Other adjustments consist primarily of net gains on the sale of assets and due diligence and transaction expenses as permitted under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company's financial covenants are measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2016, additional borrowings of $683.2 million of Total Debt and $461.2 million of Senior Debt would have been allowed under the covenants. Senior Debt includes primarily the borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility, the 3.97% Senior Notes and the borrowings under the lines of credit. The Company's unused committed credit facilities at December 31, 2016 were $386.7 million.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had the following contractual obligations and commitments:\n\n (1) Long-term debt obligations represent the required principal payments under such agreements. \n (2) Interest payments under long-term debt obligations have been estimated based on the borrowings outstanding and market interest rates as of December 31, 2016. \n (3) The amounts do not include purchase obligations reflected as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The purchase obligation amount includes all outstanding purchase orders as of the balance sheet date as well as the minimum contractual obligation or termination penalty under other contracts. \n (4) The amount included in Less Than 1 Year\u201d reflects anticipated contributions to the Company's various pension plans. Anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable. \n (5) The amounts reflect anticipated future benefit payments under the Company's various other postretirement benefit plans based on current actuarial assumptions. Expected benefit payments do not extend beyond 2026. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThe above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits as the timing of the potential payments of these amounts cannot be determined. See Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOTHER MATTERS\nInflation\nInflation generally affects the Company through its costs of labor, equipment and raw materials. Increases in the costs of these items have historically been offset by price increases, commodity price escalator provisions, operating improvements, and other cost-saving initiatives.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below. Actual results could differ from such estimates.\nInventory Valuation: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or market. Provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value. Loss provisions, if any, on aerospace contracts are established when estimable. Loss provisions are based on the projected excess of manufacturing costs over the net revenues of the products or group of related products under contract or purchase order. The process for evaluating the value of excess and obsolete inventory often requires the Company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, access to applicable markets, quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future adjustments to these provisions.\nBusiness Acquisitions, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill: Assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $633.4 million and $42.8 million of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. Goodwill represents the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or earlier if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit may have been reduced below its carrying value. Management completes its annual impairment assessments for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the second quarter of each year. The Company uses the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative impairment tests in accordance with applicable accounting standards.\nUnder the qualitative goodwill assessment, management considers relevant events and circumstances including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions, industry", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences include those described in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report. We undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements.\nOVERVIEW\n2016 Highlights\nBarnes Group Inc. (the \"Company\") achieved sales of $1,230.8 million in 2016, an increase of $36.8 million, or 3.1%, from 2015. Acquired businesses contributed incremental sales of $47.4 million during 2016. Organic sales (net sales excluding both foreign currency and acquisition impacts) decreased by $1.1 million, or 0.1%, with an increase of 0.5% and a decrease of 1.3% within the Industrial and Aerospace segments, respectively. Sales in the Industrial segment were impacted by changes in foreign currency which decreased sales by approximately $9.6 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies.\nOperating income increased 14.1% from $168.4 million in 2015 to $192.2 million in 2016 and operating margin increased from 14.1% in 2015 to 15.6% in 2016. Operating income was impacted by improved productivity within Industrial and the profit contributions of the incremental sales generated at our recently acquired businesses, partially offset by unfavorable pricing within both segments. Operating income during 2016 and 2015 included $2.3 million and $2.6 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments, respectively, related to recent business acquisitions. Operating income in 2015 included a $9.9 million lump-sum pension settlement charge and $4.2 million of charges related to certain workforce reductions and restructuring charges.\nThe Company focused on profitable sales growth both organically and through acquisition, in addition to productivity improvements, as key strategic objectives in 2016. Management continued its focus on cash flow and working capital management in 2016 and generated $217.6 million in cash flow from operations.\nBusiness Transformation\nAcquisitions and strategic relationships with our customers have been a key growth driver for the Company, and we continue to seek alliances which foster long-term business relationships. These acquisitions have allowed us to extend into new or adjacent markets, expand our geographic reach, and commercialize new products, processes and services. The Company continually evaluates its business portfolio to optimize product offerings and maximize value. We have significantly transformed our business following our entrance into the plastic injection molding market.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, the Company, through three of its subsidiaries (collectively, the Purchaser\u201d), completed its acquisition of the molds business of Adval Tech Holding AG and Adval Tech Holdings (Asia) Pte. Ltd. (\"FOBOHA\"). FOBOHA is headquartered in Haslach, Germany and operates out of three manufacturing facilities located in Germany, Switzerland and China. The Company completed its purchase of the Germany and Switzerland businesses on August 31, 2016. The purchase of the China business required government approval which was granted on September 30, 2016. FOBOHA specializes in the development and manufacture of complex plastic injection molds for packaging, medical, consumer and automotive applications. The Company acquired FOBOHA for an aggregate cash purchase price of CHF 136.3 million ($138.6 million) which was financed using cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. The purchase price includes preliminary adjustments under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\"), including approximately CHF 11.3 million ($11.5 million) related to cash acquired, and is subject to post closing adjustments under the terms of the SPA. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded $39.8 million of intangible assets and $73.7 million of goodwill. See Note 2 and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company, itself and through two of its subsidiaries, completed the acquisition of privately held Priamus System Technologies AG and two of its subsidiaries (collectively, \"Priamus\") from Growth Finance AG. Priamus, which has approximately 40 employees, is headquartered in Schaffhausen, Switzerland and has direct sales and service offices in the U.S. and Germany. Priamus is a technology leader in the development of advanced process control systems for the plastic injection molding industry and services many of the world's highest quality plastic injection molders in the medical, automotive, consumer goods, electronics and packaging markets. Priamus has been integrated into our Industrial\nsegment. The Company acquired Priamus for an aggregate cash purchase price of CHF 9.9 million ($10.1 million) which was financed using cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. The purchase price includes adjustments under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, including CHF 1.6 million ($1.6 million) related to cash acquired. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the third quarter of 2015, the Company, through one of its subsidiaries, completed the acquisition of the Thermoplay business (\"Thermoplay\") by acquiring all of the capital stock of privately held HPE S.p.A., the parent company through which Thermoplay operates (\"HPE\"). Thermoplay's headquarters and manufacturing facility are located in Pont-Saint-Martin in Aosta, Italy, with technical service capabilities in China, India, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Portugal, and Brazil. Thermoplay, which has been integrated into our Industrial segment, specializes in the design, development, and manufacturing of hot runner solutions for plastic injection molding, primarily in the packaging, automotive, and medical end markets. The Company acquired Thermoplay for an aggregate cash purchase price of \u20ac58.1 million ($63.7 million), pursuant to the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\"), which was financed using cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. The purchase price includes adjustments under the terms of the SPA, including \u20ac17.1 million ($18.7 million) related to cash acquired. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement Objectives\nManagement focused on three key strategic enablers during 2016: deployment of the Barnes Enterprise System, accelerating innovation and maturing the talent management system, which, in combination, are expected to generate long-term value for the Company's stockholders and our customers. The Company's strategies for growth include both organic growth from new products, processes, systems, services, markets and customers, and growth from acquisitions. The Company's strategies for profitability include employee engagement and empowerment to drive productivity and process initiatives, such as the application of new technologies, automation and innovation, intensified focus on intellectual property as a core differentiator. A key component of the Company's culture is the Barnes Enterprise System (BES), the Company's operating system, which drives alignment and fosters continuous improvement, collaboration and innovation throughout the global organization.\nOur Business\nThe Company consists of two operating segments: Industrial and Aerospace.\nKey Performance Indicators\nManagement evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on the sales, operating profit, operating margins and cash generation of the respective businesses, which includes net sales, cost of sales, selling and administrative expenses and certain components of other income and other expenses, as well as the allocation of corporate overhead expenses. Each segment has standard key performance indicators ( KPIs\u201d), a number of which are focused on customer metrics (on-time-delivery and quality), internal effectiveness and productivity/efficiency metrics (sales effectiveness, global sourcing, operational excellence, functional excellence, sales per employee, cost of quality, and days working capital), employee safety-related metrics (total recordable incident rate and lost time incident rate), and specific KPIs on profitable growth.\nKey Industry Data\nIn both segments, management tracks a variety of economic and industry data as indicators of the health of a particular sector.\nAt Industrial, key data for the manufacturing operations include the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMI Composite Index (and similar indices for European and Asian-based businesses); the Federal Reserve's Industrial Production Index (\"the IPI\"); the Global Insight global medical and measuring equipment index; the production of light vehicles, both in the U.S. and globally; worldwide light vehicle new model introductions and existing model refreshes; North American medium and heavy duty vehicle production; and global GDP growth forecasts.\nAt Aerospace, management of the aftermarket business monitors the number of aircraft in the active fleet, the number of planes temporarily or permanently taken out of service, aircraft utilization rates for the major airlines, engine shop visits, airline profitability, aircraft fuel costs and traffic growth. The Aerospace OEM business regularly tracks orders and deliveries for each of the major aircraft manufacturers, as well as engine purchases made for new aircraft. Management also monitors annual appropriations for the U.S. military related to purchases of new or used aircraft and engine components.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSales\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>824.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>782.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>822.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerospace\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>406.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>411.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,230.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,194.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,262.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 vs. 2015:\nThe Company reported net sales of $1,230.8 million in 2016, an increase of $36.8 million, or 3.1%, from 2015. Acquired businesses contributed incremental sales of $47.4 million during the 2016 period. Organic sales within Industrial increased by $4.1 million, or 0.5%, during 2016, primarily due to strength in our Molding Solutions businesses, slightly offset by continued softness in North American general industrial end-markets. Aerospace recorded sales of $406.5 million in 2016, a $5.2 million, or 1.3% decrease from 2015. Lower sales within the OEM and spare parts businesses were partially offset by increased sales within the MRO business. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales within Industrial by approximately $9.6 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies. Sales within Aerospace were not impacted by changes in foreign currency as these are largely denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company's international sales increased 10.4% year-over-year, while domestic sales decreased 4.7%, largely a result Aerospace sales being primarily U.S.-based. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on sales, however, the Company's international sales in 2016 increased 12.0%, inclusive of sales through acquisition, from 2015.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nThe Company reported net sales of $1,194.0 million in 2015, a decrease of $68.0 million, or 5.4%, from 2014. The acquisitions of Thermoplay on August 7, 2015 and Priamus on October 1, 2015 provided sales of $13.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively, during the 2015 period. Organic sales within Industrial increased by $13.5 million, or 1.6%, during 2015, primarily due to favorable end-markets served by our tool and die and plastics businesses during the first half of 2015. A softening within our transportation and general industrial end-markets during the second half of 2015 tempered a substantial portion of the organic growth in the first half of the year. Aerospace recorded sales of $411.7 million in 2015, a $28.3 million, or 6.4% decrease from 2014. Lower sales within the OEM and MRO businesses were partially offset by increased sales within the spare parts business. The spare parts business benefited from increased demand as a result of higher aircraft utilization and customer restocking of inventory, whereas the MRO business continued to be impacted by deferred maintenance on certain platforms. The timing of customer deliveries and execution, which was partially impacted by new product introduction challenges, in addition to the impact of a contract termination dispute, directly impacted lower sales within the OEM business during the second half of 2015. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales within Industrial by approximately $68.8 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies. Sales within Aerospace were not impacted by changes in foreign currency as these are largely denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company's international sales decreased 2.4% year-over-year, while domestic sales decreased 4.7%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on sales, however, the Company's international sales in 2015 increased 7.8%, inclusive of sales through acquisition, from 2014.\nExpenses and Operating Income\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>790.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>782.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>829.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>440.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>411.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>432.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>242.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>252.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Sales less cost of sales \n2016 vs. 2015:\nCost of sales in 2016 increased 1.0% from 2015, while gross profit margin increased from 34.4% in 2015 to 35.8% in 2016. Gross margins improved at Industrial and decreased at Aerospace. Gross margin during the comparable 2015 period included a charge of $6.4 million related to a lump-sum pension settlement charge (see Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). At Industrial, gross profit increased during 2016 primarily as a result of favorable productivity and strength within the Molding Solutions businesses. Gross profit during 2016 was negatively impacted by $2.3 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of FOBOHA, whereas the 2015 period included $0.9 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the M\u00e4nner business and $0.9 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of Thermoplay. Within Aerospace, a decline in gross profit relates primarily to lower sales volumes and unfavorable productivity. Selling and administrative expenses in 2016 increased 2.3% from the 2015 period, due in part to $3.0 million of costs related to the contract termination dispute within the Aerospace segment and the incremental operations of the acquired businesses, partially offset by an $0.8 million reduction in short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to acquisitions. During the 2015 period, selling and administrative expenses included $4.2 million of charges related to workforce reductions and severance, and $3.5 million of lump-sum pension settlement charges. Short-term purchase accounting adjustments that impact selling and administrative expenses during 2015 included $0.6 million and $0.3 million related to the acquisitions of M\u00e4nner and Thermoplay, respectively. As a percentage of sales, selling and administrative costs decreased slightly from 20.3% in the 2015 period to 20.2% in the 2016 period. Operating income in the 2016 period increased 14.1% to $192.2 million from 2015 and operating income margin increased from 14.1% to 15.6%.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nCost of sales in 2015 decreased 5.6% from 2014, while gross profit margin increased slightly from 34.3% in 2014 to 34.4% in 2015. Gross margins remained flat at Industrial and improved slightly at Aerospace, however a higher percentage of sales were driven by the Industrial segment in 2015. The gross profit decrease during 2015 includes a charge of $6.4 million related to a lump-sum pension settlement (see Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). At Industrial, gross profit during 2014 was partially offset by $4.5 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the M\u00e4nner business and restructuring charges of $5.4 million related to the closure of the Saline facility, which was completed in 2014. During 2015, short term purchase accounting adjustments of $0.9 million and $0.9 million were related to the acquisitions of the M\u00e4nner business and Thermoplay, respectively. Within Aerospace, gross profit declined as a result lower sales within OEM, partially offset by increased profits within the spare parts business, and a $2.8 million charge related to a contract termination dispute following a customer decision to re-source. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 3.8% from 2014 due primarily to foreign exchange translation and a $3.4 million reduction in the short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the M\u00e4nner business. Lower employee related expenses, primarily from incentive compensation, reduced selling and administrative expenses during the 2015 period. The 2014 period also included $0.6 million of charges related to the closure of the Saline facility. These expense reductions during 2015 were partially offset by $4.2 million of charges related to workforce reductions and severance, $3.5 million of lump-sum pension settlement charges and $0.3 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of Thermoplay. As a percentage of sales, selling and administrative costs increased from 20.0% in 2014 to 20.3% in 2015. Operating margin was 14.1% in 2015 compared to 14.3% in 2014.\nInterest expense\n2016 vs. 2015:\nInterest expense in 2016 increased $1.2 million to $11.9 million from 2015, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nInterest expense in 2015 decreased $0.7 million to $10.7 million from 2014, primarily as a result of lower average borrowings, partially offset by higher average borrowing rates resulting from the 3.97% Senior Notes that were issued under the Note Purchase Agreement executed on October 15, 2014. See Liquidity and Capital Resources within Item 7.\nOther expense (income), net\n2016 vs. 2015:\nOther expense (income), net in 2016 was $(2.3) million compared to $(0.2) million in 2015. Foreign currency gains of $1.9 million in the 2016 period compared with gains of $0.5 million in the 2015 period. Interest income of $2.3 million in 2016 compared with interest income of $1.0 million during 2015, with the increase being primarily attributed to the $1.4 million of interest income resulting from the Triumph arbitration award. See Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nOther expense (income), net in 2015 was $(0.2) million compared to $2.1 million in 2014. Foreign currency gains of $0.5 million in the 2015 period compared with foreign currency losses of $1.5 million in the 2014 period.\nIncome Taxes\n2016 vs. 2015:\nThe Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations was 25.7% in 2016 compared with 23.2% in 2015. The increase in the 2016 effective tax rate from continuing operations is primarily due to the expiration of certain tax holidays, the absence of the 2015 refund of withholding taxes and the change in the mix of earnings attributable to higher-taxing jurisdictions, partially offset by lower repatriation of a portion of current year foreign earnings to the U.S and the excess tax benefit on stock awards, reflecting the amended guidance related to share-based payments made to employees. See Note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2016, the Company repatriated a dividend from a portion of the current year foreign earnings to the U.S. in the amount of $8.3 million compared to $19.5 million in 2015. The decrease in the dividend decreased tax expense by $3.9 million and decreased the annual effective tax rate by 2.2 percentage points compared to 2015.\nIn 2017, the Company expects the effective tax rate from continuing operations to increase to between 27% and 28% primarily due to the absence of any excess tax benefit on stock awards and the expiration of certain foreign tax holidays.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nThe Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations was 23.2% in 2015 compared with 27.6% in 2014. The decrease in 2015 is primarily due to a tax refund of withholding taxes, the granting of an extended tax holiday in China as well as a change in the mix of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions offset by an increase in the repatriation of a portion of current year foreign earnings to the U.S. During 2015, the Company repatriated a dividend from a portion of the current year foreign earnings to the U.S. in the amount of $19.5 million compared to $12.5 million in 2014.

Acquired businesses contributed incremental sales of $47.4 million during the 2016 period. Organic sales increased by $4.1 million, or 0.5%, during 2016, driven primarily by strength in our Molding Solutions businesses, slightly offset by continued softness in North American general industrial end-markets. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales by approximately $9.6 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies.\nOperating profit in 2016 at Industrial was $129.7 million, an increase of 26.0% from 2015. The increase was driven by favorable productivity, as the Company continued its focus on manufacturing efficiencies and improved supply chain management across multiple units, and the profit contributions of acquired businesses, partially offset by lower pricing. The 2015 period included $3.6 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments and transaction costs related to business acquisitions, whereas the acquisition of FOBOHA during the 2016 period resulted in $3.5 million of such costs. The 2015 period also included lump-sum pension settlement charges of $7.5 million that were allocated to the segment and $3.4 million of charges related to certain workforce reductions and restructuring.\nOutlook:\nIn Industrial, management is focused on generating organic sales growth through the introduction of new products and by leveraging the benefits of the diversified products and industrial end-markets in which its businesses have a global presence. Our ability to generate sales growth is subject to economic conditions in the global markets served by all of our businesses. For general industrial end-markets, manufacturing Purchasing Managers Indexes (\"PMIs\") above 50 in North America and Europe are positive signs. China, although relatively stable during the first half of 2016, demonstrated strength during the second half of the year. Within China, we have seen a strengthening in orders that began during the second quarter and continued throughout the remainder of 2016, indicating strength within the transportation markets. Global forecasted production for light vehicles is expected to grow nominally in 2017, however production is expected to remain stable within the markets in which the Company operates. Within our Molding Solution businesses, North American and European markets remain healthy, while demand in Asia is more modest. For the Molding Solutions businesses in 2017, we anticipate favorable demand trends to continue within the medical and personal care hot runner markets and the packaging and medical mold markets. As noted above, our sales were negatively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currencies during 2016 of $9.6 million. To the extent that the U.S. dollar remains strong as compared with the other foreign currencies, our sales may continue to be unfavorably impacted by foreign currency relative to the prior year periods. The relative impact on operating profit is not expected to be as significant as the impact on sales as most of our businesses have expenses primarily denominated in local currencies, where their revenues reside. The Company also remains focused on sales growth through acquisition and expanding geographic reach. Strategic investments in new technologies, manufacturing processes and product development are expected to provide incremental benefits over the long term.\nOperating profit is largely dependent on the sales volumes and mix of the businesses in the segment. Management continues to focus on improving profitability and expanding margins through leveraging organic sales growth, acquisitions, pricing initiatives, global sourcing and productivity. Workforce reductions and facility consolidations initiated in 2015, combined with other productivity initiatives during 2016, contributed favorably throughout the year. We continue to evaluate market conditions and remain proactive in managing costs. Costs associated with new product and process introductions, productivity or restructuring initiatives, strategic investments and the integration of acquisitions may negatively impact operating profit.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nSales at Industrial were $782.3 million in 2015, a decrease of $39.8 million or 4.8% from 2014. The acquisitions of Thermoplay on August 7, 2015 and Priamus on October 1, 2015 provided sales of $13.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively, during the 2015 period. Organic sales increased by $13.5 million, or 1.6%, during 2015, primarily due to favorable end-markets served by our tool and die and plastics businesses during the first half of 2015. A softening within our transportation and general industrial end-markets during the second half of 2015 tempered a substantial portion of organic growth in the first half. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales by approximately $68.8 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies.\nOperating profit in 2015 at Industrial was $103.0 million, a decrease of 5.0% from 2014. Operating profit benefited primarily from the profit contribution of increased organic sales within our end markets during the first half of 2015, more than offset by lower productivity and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange during the full year. The 2015 period also included lump-sum pension settlement charges of $7.5 million that were allocated to the segment, short-term purchase adjustments and transaction costs resulting from the acquisitions of Thermoplay and Priamus of $1.9 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and $3.4 million of charges related to certain workforce reductions and restructuring. Lower sales volumes during the second half of 2015 tapered the benefit of growth in organic sales during the first half of the year. The 2014 period included $8.5 million of short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the M\u00e4nner Business, whereas the 2015 period included $1.5 million of such adjustments. The 2014 period also included $6.0 million of pre-tax restructuring charges related to the closure of production operations at the facility in Saline, Michigan.\nAerospace\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>406.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>411.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>440.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 vs. 2015:\nAerospace recorded sales of $406.5 million in 2016, a 1.3% decrease from 2015. Lower sales within the original equipment manufacturing (\"OEM\") and spare parts businesses were partially offset by increased sales within the aftermarket maintenance repair and overhaul (\"MRO\") business. During the 2016 period, the segment continued to transition from the manufacture of components on legacy engine platforms to newer, more technologically advanced platforms. Lower volumes on the GE90 engine platform, as well as on other mature engine platforms, were partially offset by increased volume generated by newer programs within the OEM business. A decline in aftermarket spare parts was partially offset by a volume increase in the MRO business. Customer inventory management resulted in lower volumes within the spare parts business. Sales within the MRO business, although soft during the first half of the year, improved during the second half of 2016 as we obtained additional sales volume from existing customers. This business, however, continues to be impacted by airlines continuing to closely manage their aftermarket costs and as engine performance and quality has improved. Sales were not impacted by changes in foreign currency as sales within the segment are largely denominated in U.S. dollars.\nOperating profit at Aerospace decreased 4.5% from 2015 to $62.5 million. The operating profit decrease was primarily due to pricing deflation, the profit impact of lower volumes within the highly profitable spare parts business and unfavorable productivity, primarily a result of the transition from legacy engine platforms to newer, more advanced programs. Operating profit included a $1.4 million benefit from the contract termination arbitration award. Charges related to the contract termination dispute approximated $3.0 million and $2.8 million during the 2016 and 2015 periods, respectively. Operating profit in 2015 also included a lump-sum pension settlement charge of $2.4 million that was allocated to the segment and $0.8 million in workforce reduction and restructuring charges.\nOutlook:\nSales in the Aerospace OEM business are based on the general state of the aerospace market driven by the worldwide economy and are supported by its order backlog through participation in certain strategic commercial and military engine and airframe programs. Over the next several years, the Company expects strength in demand for new engines, driven by an expected increase in commercial aircraft production levels. The Company sees 2016 as having been a transition year for the Aerospace OEM business as it moves from declining production on some of its legacy engine programs onto the ramping of several new engine programs. Backlog at OEM was $626.3 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of 11.1% since December 31, 2015, at which time backlog was $563.9 million. Approximately 50% of OEM backlog is expected to ship in the next 12 months. The Aerospace OEM business may be impacted by changes in the content levels on certain platforms, changes in customer sourcing decisions, adjustments to customer inventory levels, commodity availability and pricing, changes in production schedules of specific engine and airframe programs, redesign of parts, quantity of parts per engine, cost schedules agreed to under contract with the engine manufacturers, as well as the pursuit and duration of new programs. Sales in the Aerospace aftermarket business may be impacted by fluctuations in end-market demand, inventory management and changes in customer sourcing, deferred or limited maintenance activity during engine shop visits and the use of surplus (used) material during the engine repair and overhaul process. End markets are expected to grow based on the long term underlying fundamentals of the aerospace industry. Management continues to believe its Aerospace aftermarket business is competitively positioned based on well-established long-term customer relationships, including maintenance and repair contracts in the MRO business and long-term Revenue Sharing Programs (\"RSPs\") and Component Repair Programs (\"CRPs\"), expanded capabilities and current capacity levels. Fluctuations in fuel costs and their impact on airline profitability and behaviors within the aerospace industry could impact levels and frequency of aircraft maintenance and overhaul activities, and airlines' decisions on maintaining, deferring or canceling new aircraft purchases, in part based on the value associated with new fuel efficient technologies.\nManagement is focused on growing operating profit at Aerospace primarily through leveraging organic sales growth, strategic investments, new product and process introductions, and productivity. Operating profit is expected to be affected by the impact of changes in sales volume, mix and pricing, particularly as they relate to the highly profitable aftermarket RSP\nspare parts business, and investments made in each of its businesses. During 2015, the Company responded to the challenging economic environment affecting certain of our Aerospace businesses. Workforce reductions and restructure charges were recorded following reduced aftermarket volumes and the impact of a customer's in-sourcing decision. Taking these actions supported our productivity initiatives and have begun to favorably impact segment results during 2016. Costs associated with new product and process introductions, the initial physical transfer of work to lower cost manufacturing regions, additional productivity initiatives and restructuring activities may also negatively impact operating profit.\n2015 vs. 2014:\nAerospace recorded sales of $411.7 million in 2015, a 6.4% decrease from 2014. Lower sales within the OEM and MRO businesses were partially offset by increased sales within the spare parts business. The spare parts business benefited from increased demand as a result of higher aircraft utilization and customer restocking of inventory, whereas the MRO business continued to be impacted by deferred maintenance on certain platforms. The timing of customer deliveries and execution, which was partially impacted by new product introduction challenges, in addition to the impact of a contract termination dispute, directly impacted lower sales within the OEM business during the second half of 2015. Sales were not impacted by changes in foreign currency as sales within the segment are largely denominated in U.S. dollars.\nOperating profit at Aerospace decreased 8.6% from 2014 to $65.4 million. The operating profit decrease was primarily due to the profit impact of lower sales within the OEM and MRO businesses, lump-sum pension settlement charges of $2.4 million that were allocated to the segment, $0.8 million in workforce reduction and restructuring charges, a $2.8 million charge that resulted from a contract termination dispute following a customer decision to re-source work and lower productivity. Partially offsetting these items were the higher profit impact of increased sales within the spare parts business and lower employee related costs, primarily incentive compensation, partially offset by higher pension costs.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nManagement assesses the Company's liquidity in terms of its overall ability to generate cash to fund its operating and investing activities. Of particular importance in the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditure levels, dividends, capital stock transactions, effective utilization of surplus cash positions overseas and adequate lines of credit.\nThe Company's ability to generate cash from operations in excess of its internal operating needs is one of its financial strengths. Management continues to focus on cash flow and working capital management, and anticipates that operating activities in 2017 will generate sufficient cash to fund operations. The Company closely monitors its cash generation, usage and preservation including the management of working capital to generate cash.\nOn October 15, 2014, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement ( Note Purchase Agreement\u201d), among the Company and New York Life Insurance Company, New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation and New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation Institutionally Owned Life Insurance Separate Account (BOLI 30C), as purchasers, for the issuance of $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.97% senior notes due October 17, 2024 (the 3.97% Senior Notes\u201d). The Company completed funding of the transaction and issued the 3.97% Senior Notes on October 17, 2014. The 3.97% Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and pays interest semi-annually on April 17 and October 17 of each year at an annual rate of 3.97%. The 3.97% Senior Notes will mature on October 17, 2024 unless earlier prepaid in accordance with their terms. Subject to certain conditions, the Company may, at its option, prepay all or any part of the 3.97% Senior Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 3.97% Senior Notes so prepaid, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of prepayment, plus the Make-Whole Amount, as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement, with respect to such principal amount being prepaid. The Note Purchase Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that are similar to the covenants required under the Amended Credit Agreement, as discussed below. At December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Note Purchase Agreement.\nDuring the second quarter of 2014, the 3.375% Convertible Notes (the \"3.375% Notes\") were eligible for conversion due to meeting their conversion price eligibility requirement. On June 16, 2014, $0.2 million of the 3.375% Notes (par value) were surrendered for conversion. On June 24, 2014, the Company exercised its right to redeem the remaining $55.4 million principal amount of the 3.375% Notes, effective July 31, 2014. The Company elected to pay cash to holders of the 3.375% Notes surrendered for conversion, including the value of any residual shares of common stock that might be payable to the holders electing to convert their 3.375% Notes into an equivalent share value. Under the terms of the indenture, the conversion value was measured based upon a 20-day valuation period of the Company's stock price. The Company used borrowings under its Amended Credit Facility to finance the redemption and conversion of the 3.375% Notes. The remaining 3.375% Notes were\nrendered for conversion during the third quarter of 2014 and the Company paid $70.5 million in cash to the holders, which included a premium of $14.9 million.\nIn September 2013, the Company entered into a second amendment to its fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement (the \"Amended Credit Agreement\u201d) and retained Bank of America, N.A. as the administrative agent for the lenders. The $750.0 million Amended Credit Agreement matures in September 2018. The Amended Credit Agreement adds a new foreign subsidiary borrower in Germany, Barnes Group Acquisition GmbH, and includes an accordion feature to increase the borrowing availability of the Company to $1,000.0 million. The Company may exercise the accordion feature upon request to the Administrative Agent as long as an event of default has not occurred or is continuing. The borrowing availability of $750.0 million, pursuant to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, allows for Euro-denominated borrowings equivalent to $500.0 million. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 1.10% to 1.70% depending on the Company's leverage ratio at prior quarter end. In October 2014, the Company entered into a third amendment to its fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement, which allowed for the issuance of the Note Purchase Agreement.\nThe Company's borrowing capacity was limited by various debt covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement (the \"Agreements\"). The Agreements require the Company to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Senior Debt, as defined in the Agreements, to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined, of not more than 3.25 times at the end of each fiscal quarter (\"Senior Debt Ratio\"), a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt, as defined, to Consolidated EBITDA of not more than 4.00 times at the end of each fiscal quarter, and a ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense, as defined, of not less than 4.25 times at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Agreements also provide that in connection with certain permitted acquisitions with aggregate consideration in excess of $150.0 million, the Consolidated Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio and the Consolidated Total Debt to EBITDA ratio are permitted to increase to 3.50 times and 4.25 times, respectively, for a period of the four fiscal quarters ending after the closing of the acquisition. At December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Agreements. The Company's most restrictive financial covenant is the Senior Debt Ratio which requires the Company to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Senior Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of not more than 3.25 times at December 31, 2016. The actual ratio at December 31, 2016 was 1.69 times.\nIn February 2017, the Company entered into the fourth amendment of its fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement (the the Fourth Amendment\u201d) and retained Bank of America, N.A as the Administrative Agent for the lenders. The Fourth Amendment increases the facility to $850.0 million and extends the maturity date to February 2022. The Fourth Amendment also increases the existing accordion feature, allowing the Company to request additional borrowings of up to $350.0 million. The Company may exercise the accordion feature upon request to the Administrative Agent as long as an event of default has not occurred or is not continuing. The borrowing availability of $850.0 million, pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Amendment, allow for multi-currency borrowing which includes euro, sterling or Swiss franc borrowing, up to $600.0 million. Depending on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio, and at the election of the Company, borrowings under the Fourth Amendment will bear interest at either LIBOR plus a margin of between 1.10% and 1.70% or the base rate plus a margin of 0.10% to 0.70%. The Fourth Amendment generally requires the Company to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Senior Debt, as defined, to Consolidated EBITDA of not more than 3.25 times, a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt, as defined, to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined, of not more than 3.75 times, and a ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense, as defined, of not less than 4.25 times, in each case at the end of each fiscal quarter; provided that these debt to EBITDA ratios are permitted to increase for a period of four fiscal quarters after the closing of certain permitted acquisitions.\nIn 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company acquired 0.6 million shares, 1.4 million shares and 0.2 million shares of the Company's common stock, respectively, at a cost of $20.5 million, $52.1 million and $8.4 million, respectively.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, the Company, through three of its subsidiaries (collectively, the Purchaser\u201d), completed its acquisition of the molds business of Adval Tech Holding AG and Adval Tech Holdings (Asia) Pte. Ltd. (\"FOBOHA\")(collectively, the Sellers\u201d). See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company acquired FOBOHA for an aggregate cash purchase price of CHF 136.3 million ($138.6 million) which was financed using cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. The purchase price includes preliminary adjustments under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\"), including approximately CHF 11.3 million ($11.5 million) related to cash acquired, and is subject to post closing adjustments under the terms of the SPA The aggregate purchase was paid using cash on hand of $68.5 million and borrowings of $70.1 million under the Company's revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2016, the Company had repaid $62.0 million of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility using cash generated from its foreign operations. In July 2016, the Company entered into forward contract agreements (CHF 133.0 million in aggregate) to reduce the exposure to foreign currency exchange rates on the purchase price. These forward contract agreements were subsequently settled in August 2016 and did not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nOperating cash flow may be supplemented with external borrowings to meet near-term business expansion needs and the Company's current financial commitments. The Company has assessed its credit facilities in conjunction with the Fourth Amendment of the Amended Credit Facility and currently expects that its bank syndicate, comprised of 14 banks, will continue to support its Amended Credit Agreement which matures in February 2022. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $386.7 million unused and available for borrowings under its then existing $750.0 million Amended Credit Facility, subject to covenants in the Company's debt agreements. At December 31, 2016, additional borrowings of $683.2 million of Total Debt and $461.2 million of Senior Debt would have been allowed under the financial covenants. The Company intends to use borrowings under its Amended Credit Facility to support the Company's ongoing growth initiatives. The Company believes its credit facilities and access to capital markets, coupled with cash generated from operations, are adequate for its anticipated future requirements.\nThe Company had $30.7 million in borrowings under short-term bank credit lines at December 31, 2016.\nIn 2012, the Company entered into five-year interest rate swap agreements transacted with three banks which together convert the interest on the first $100.0 million of borrowings under the Company's Credit Agreement from a variable rate plus the borrowing spread to a fixed rate of 1.03% plus the borrowing spread for the purpose of mitigating its exposure to variable interest rates. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company's total borrowings were comprised of 41% fixed rate debt and 59% variable rate debt.\nThe funded status of the Company's pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including actual rates of return that impact the fair value of pension assets and changes in discount rates that impact projected benefit obligations. The unfunded status of the pension plans increased from $65.7 million at December 31, 2015 to $77.0 million at December 31, 2016 as the increase in the projected benefit obligations (\"PBOs\") exceeded the increase in the fair value of the pension plan assets, following an update of certain actuarial assumptions. The Company recorded a $8.9 million non-cash after-tax decrease in stockholders equity (through other non-owner changes to equity) to record the current year adjustments for changes in the funded status of its pension and postretirement benefit plans as required under accounting for defined benefit and other postretirement plans. This decrease in stockholders equity resulted primarily from changes in actuarial assumptions, primarily the discount rate, and unfavorable variances between expected and actual returns on pension plan assets, offset by the amortization of actuarial losses recorded earlier. In 2016, as planned, the Company made $15.0 million in discretionary contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plans. The Company expects to contribute approximately $4.9 million to its various defined benefit pension plans in 2017. No discretionary contributions to the U.S. Qualified pension plans in 2017 are currently planned. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company held $66.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, the majority of which was held by foreign subsidiaries. These amounts have no material regulatory or contractual restrictions and are expected to primarily fund international investments. The Company repatriated $8.3 million of current year foreign earnings to the U.S. during 2016.\nAny future acquisitions are expected to be financed through internal cash, borrowings and equity, or a combination thereof. Additionally, we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\nCash Flow\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>217.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>217.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>196.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(179.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(115.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(124.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exchange rate effect\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(55.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________________\nNM - Not meaningful\nOperating activities provided $217.6 million in 2016 compared to $217.5 million in 2015. Operating cash flows in the 2016 period were positively impacted by improved operating performance as well as a reduction in outflows of accrued liabilities, including employee incentive compensation payments. Cash inflows in the 2016 period were partially offset by an\noutflow of $15.0 million related to discretionary contributions to the U.S. Qualified pension plans and were negatively impacted by an increase in receivables resulting from sales growth which generated a use of cash in 2016.\nInvesting activities used $179.5 million in cash in 2016 and $115.5 million in 2015. Investing activities in 2016 include a cash outflow of $127.1 million used to fund the FOBOHA acquisition compared to $52.0 million used to fund the Thermoplay and Priamus acquistions in 2015. Investing activities in 2016 also include a payment of $1.5 million related to the post-acquisition closing adjustment of Thermoplay. Payments related to the Component Repair Programs (\"CRPs\") were $4.1 million in 2016 compared to $21.0 million in 2015. See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital expenditures were $47.6 million in 2016 compared to $46.0 million in 2015. The Company expects capital spending in 2017 to approximate $55 million. Capital expenditures relate to both maintenance needs and support of growth initiatives, which include the purchase of equipment to support new products and services, and will be funded primarily through cash flows from operations.\nCash used by financing activities in 2016 included a net decrease in borrowings of $9.9 million compared to a net increase of $2.7 million in 2015. In 2016, the Company borrowed $100.0 million under the Amended Credit Facility through an international subsidiary. The proceeds were distributed to the Parent Company and subsequently used to pay down U.S. borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock were $4.6 million and $11.4 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2016, the Company repurchased 0.6 million shares of the Company's stock at a cost of $20.5 million, compared with the purchase of 1.4 million shares at a cost of $52.1 million in 2015. Total cash used to pay dividends increased slightly to $27.4 million in 2016 compared to $26.2 million in 2015. Withholding taxes paid on stock issuances in the 2016 and 2015 periods were $4.9 million and $4.9 million, respectively. Other financing cash flows during 2016 and 2015 include $5.2 million and $10.3 million, respectively, of net cash proceeds from the settlement of foreign currency hedges related to intercompany financings.\nDebt Covenants\nBorrowing capacity is limited by various debt covenants in the Company's debt agreements. As of December 31, 2016, the most restrictive financial covenant is included within the Amended Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement and requires the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Consolidated Senior Debt, as defined, to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined, of not more than 3.25 times for the four fiscal quarters then ending. The Agreements also contain other financial covenants that require the maintenance of a certain other debt ratio, Consolidated Total Debt, as defined, to Consolidated EBITDA of not more than 4.00 times and a certain interest coverage ratio, Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense, as defined, of at least 4.25 times, at December 31, 2016. The Agreements also provide that in connection with certain permitted acquisitions with aggregate consideration in excess of $150.0 million, the Consolidated Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio and the Consolidated Total Debt to EBITDA ratio are permitted to increase to 3.50 times and 4.25 times, respectively, for a period of the four fiscal quarters ending after the closing of the acquisition. Following is a reconciliation of Consolidated EBITDA to the Company's net income (in millions):\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income taxes\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>80.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment for non-cash stock based compensation\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Adjustment for acquired businesses\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of FOBOHA acquisition inventory step-up\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated EBITDA, as defined\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>296.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Senior Debt, as defined, as of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>501.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of Consolidated Senior Debt to Consolidated EBITDA\n</td> <td>1.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum\n</td> <td>3.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Total Debt, as defined, as of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>501.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA\n</td> <td>1.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Cash Interest Expense, as defined, as of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense\n</td> <td>22.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum\n</td> <td>4.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Amended Credit Agreement allows for certain adjustments within the calculation of the financial covenants. The adjustment for acquired businesses reflects the unaudited pre-acquisition operations of FOBOHA for the period from January 1, 2016 through August 31, 2016. Other adjustments consist primarily of net gains on the sale of assets and due diligence and transaction expenses as permitted under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company's financial covenants are measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2016, additional borrowings of $683.2 million of Total Debt and $461.2 million of Senior Debt would have been allowed under the covenants. Senior Debt includes primarily the borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility, the 3.97% Senior Notes and the borrowings under the lines of credit. The Company's unused committed credit facilities at December 31, 2016 were $386.7 million.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had the following contractual obligations and commitments:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>470.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest payments under long-term obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected pension contributions (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected benefit payments - other postretirement benefit plans (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>722.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>404.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Long-term debt obligations represent the required principal payments under such agreements. \n (2) Interest payments under long-term debt obligations have been estimated based on the borrowings outstanding and market interest rates as of December 31, 2016. \n (3) The amounts do not include purchase obligations reflected as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

See Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOTHER MATTERS\nInflation\nInflation generally affects the Company through its costs of labor, equipment and raw materials. Increases in the costs of these items have historically been offset by price increases, commodity price escalator provisions, operating improvements, and other cost-saving initiatives.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below. Actual results could differ from such estimates.\nInventory Valuation: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or market. Provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value. Loss provisions, if any, on aerospace contracts are established when estimable. Loss provisions are based on the projected excess of manufacturing costs over the net revenues of the products or group of related products under contract or purchase order. The process for evaluating the value of excess and obsolete inventory often requires the Company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, access to applicable markets, quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future adjustments to these provisions.\nBusiness Acquisitions, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill: Assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $633.4 million and $42.8 million of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. Goodwill represents the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or earlier if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit may have been reduced below its carrying value. Management completes its annual impairment assessments for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the second quarter of each year. The Company uses the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative impairment tests in accordance with applicable accounting standards.\nUnder the qualitative goodwill assessment, management considers relevant events and circumstances including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions, industry"}
