We combine our processor design capabilities with our expertise in video and image processing algorithms and software to provide a technology platform that is designed to be easily scalable across multiple applications and enable rapid and efficient product development. Our system-on-a-chip, or SoC, designs fully integrate HD video processing, image processing, audio processing and system functions onto a single chip, delivering exceptional video and image quality, differentiated functionality and low power consumption.\nWe sell our solutions to leading original design manufacturers, or ODMs, and original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, globally. We refer to ODMs as our customers and OEMs as our end customers, except as otherwise indicated or as the context otherwise requires. In the camera market, our solutions enable the creation of high-quality video content primarily for wearable sports cameras, Internet Protocol, or IP, security cameras, unmanned aerial vehicle cameras, also referred to as UAVs, drones or flying cameras, and automotive aftermarket cameras. In the infrastructure market, our solutions efficiently manage IP video traffic, broadcast encoding, transcoding and IP video delivery applications.\nOur sales cycles typically require a significant investment of time and a substantial expenditure of resources before we can realize revenue from the sale of our solutions, if any. Our typical sales cycle consists of a multi-month sales and development process involving our customers' system designers and management along with our sales personnel and software engineers. If successful, this process culminates in a customer's decision to use our solutions in its system, which we refer to as a design win. Our sales efforts are typically directed to the OEM of the product that will incorporate our video and image processing solution, but the eventual design and incorporation of our SoC into the product may be handled by an ODM on behalf of the OEM. Volume production may begin within six to 18 months after a design win, depending on the complexity of our customer's product and other factors upon which we may have little or no influence. Once one of our solutions has been incorporated into a customer's design, we believe that our solution is likely to remain a component of the customer's product for its life cycle because of the time and expense associated with redesigning a product or substituting an alternative solution. Conversely, a design loss to a competitor will likely preclude any opportunity for us to generate future revenue from such customer's product. Even if we obtain a design win and our SoC remains a component through the life cycle of a customer's product, the volume and timing of actual sales of our SoCs to the customer depend upon the production, release and market acceptance of that product, none of which are within our control.\nFiscal Year 2016 Financial Highlights and Trends\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> We recorded revenue of $316.4 million, an increase of 44.9% as compared to fiscal year 2015. The increase over the prior fiscal year was primarily due to strong demand for our A9, A7L, S2L and A12 SoCs in the IP security, UAV, automotive aftermarket and wearable sports camera markets. The strong growth in the IP security camera market reflected a broader adoption of our S2L SoC by current customers in the professional security market as well as the addition of new customers in the home security and monitoring market. Despite the strong revenue growth in the IP security camera market, we experienced some softness in the China region in the second half of fiscal year 2016, which partially offset stronger results in other geographic regions in the period. Although UAVs are in the early stage of market adoption, we experienced strong growth in fiscal year 2016 due to the launch of new models from an existing customer and initial adoption by new customers. In the automotive aftermarket, which is dominated by demand from Asia, revenues grew as customer demand for more feature-rich products increased which is well suited to our product offerings. Although the revenue in the wearable sports camera market increased in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015, we saw a decline in this market in the second half of fiscal year 2016 as a result of high inventory levels at a major end customer. In addition, we anticipate that these high inventory levels at our customer in the wearable sports camera market will significantly and adversely impact our revenues in fiscal year 2017, particularly the first half of the fiscal year. For the twelve months ended January 31, 2016, the increases in the camera market was partially offset by a year-over-year decline in the infrastructure market resulting from continued weak market conditions in the United States and Europe as system manufacturers continue to delay investment in network upgrades to the new H.265 compression technology.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> We recorded operating income of $84.7 million, an increase of 63.3% as compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to continuing growth in revenues, as well as efficient control of product costs and operating expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> We generated cash flows from operating activities of $123.6 million in fiscal year 2016, as compared to $52.3 million in fiscal year 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased net income as adjusted for increased non-cash stock-based compensation. The increase also was attributable to decreased accounts receivable associated with the timing of payments from customers, decreased inventory purchase associated with a decrease in near term revenue forecasts, increased deferred revenue associated with the timing of inventory shipments by our logistics providers and increased long-term liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The increase was partially offset by decreased liabilities associated with the timing of payments to suppliers as well as income tax payables.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> On June 25, 2015, we completed the acquisition of VisLab S.r.l., a privately-held Italian company that develops computer vision and intelligent control systems for automotive and other commercial applications, including Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and several generations of autonomous vehicle driving systems, for $30.0 million in cash. Of this total purchase price, $4.1 million was attributed to intangible assets, $25.3 million was attributed to goodwill, and $0.6 million was attributed to net assets acquired.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nDesign Wins. We closely monitor design wins by customer and end market. We consider design wins to be critical to our future success, although a design win may not successfully materialize into revenue, and even if they result in revenue, the amount generated by each design win can vary significantly. Our long-term sales expectations are based on forecasts from customers and internal estimations of customer demand factoring in the expected time to market for end customer products incorporating our solutions and associated revenue potential. Our ability to accurately forecast demand, however, can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including inaccurate forecasting by our customers, miscalculations by our customers of their inventory requirements, changes in market conditions, adverse changes in our product order mix and fluctuating demand for our customers' products.\nPricing, Product Cost and Margin. Our pricing and margins depend on the volumes and the features of the solutions we provide to our customers. Additionally, we make significant investments in new solutions for both cost improvements and new features that we expect to drive revenue and maintain margins. In general, solutions incorporated into more complex configurations, such as those used in high-performance camera or infrastructure applications, have higher prices and higher gross margins as compared to solutions sold into lower performing, more competitive camera applications. Our average selling price, or ASP, can vary by market and application due to market-specific supply and demand, the maturation of products launched in previous years and the launch of new products.\nWe continually monitor the cost of our solutions. As we rely on third-party manufacturers for the production of our products, we maintain a close relationship with these suppliers to continually monitor production yields, component costs and design efficiencies.\nShifting Consumer Preferences. Our revenue is subject to consumer preferences, regarding form factor and functionality, and how those preferences impact the video and image capture electronics that we support. For example, improved smartphone video capture capabilities, and the rapid adoption by consumers, led to the decline of pocket video cameras aimed at the video and image capture market. The current video and image capture market is now characterized by a greater volume of more specialized video and image capture devices that are less likely to be replaced with smartphones, such as wearable, including sports, IP security, UAV and automotive aftermarket cameras. This increasing specialization of video capture devices has changed our customer base and end markets and has impacted our revenue. In the future, we expect further changes in the market to continue to impact our business performance.\nContinued Concentration of Revenue by End Market. Historically, our revenue has been significantly concentrated in a small number of end markets. In fiscal year 2010, the majority of our revenue came from the pocket video, camcorder and infrastructure markets. Since that time, we have developed technologies to provide solutions for new markets such as the wearable, including sports, IP security, UAV and automotive aftermarket camera markets. We believe these new markets can continue to facilitate revenue growth and customer diversification. Since fiscal year 2013, the wearable sports and IP security markets have been our largest end markets and sales into these markets collectively generated the majority of our revenue. While we will continue to expand our end market exposure, such as to non-sports wearable cameras and UAVs, we anticipate that sales to a limited number of end markets will continue to account for a significant percentage of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. Our end market concentration may cause our financial performance to fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the success or failure of products that our SoCs are designed into as well as the overall growth or decline in the video capture markets in which we compete. In addition, we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of ODMs who build products on behalf of a limited number of OEMs and from a limited number of OEMs to whom we ship directly. We believe that our operating results for the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers.\nAbility to Capitalize on Connectivity Trend. Mobile connected devices are ubiquitous today and play an increasingly prominent role in consumers' lives. The constant connectivity provided by these devices has created a demand for connected electronic peripherals such as video and image capture devices. Our ability to capitalize on these trends by supporting our end customers in the development of connected peripherals that seamlessly cooperate with other connected devices and allow consumers to distribute and share video and images with online media platforms is critical for our success. We have added wireless communication functionality into our solutions for wearable, including sports, IP security, UAV and automotive aftermarket cameras. The combination of our compression technology with wireless connectivity enables wireless video streaming and uploading of videos and images to the Internet. Our solutions enable IP security camera systems to stream video content to either cloud infrastructure or connected mobile devices, and our solutions for wearable, including sports, and UAV cameras allow consumers to quickly stream or upload video and images to social media platforms.\nSales Volume. A typical camera design win that successfully launches into the marketplace can generate a wide range of sales volumes for our solutions, depending on the end market demand for our customers' products. This can depend on several factors, including the reputation of the end customer, market penetration, product capabilities, size of the end market that the product addresses and our end customers' ability to sell their products. In certain cases, we may provide volume discounts on sales of our solutions, which may be offset by lower manufacturing costs related to higher volumes. In general, our customers with greater market penetration and better branding tend to develop products that generate larger volumes over the product life cycle.\nCustomer Product Life Cycle. We estimate our customers' product life cycles based on the customer, type of product and end market. In general, products launched in the camera market have shorter life cycles than those sold into the infrastructure market. We typically commence commercial shipments from six to 18 months following a design win; however, in some markets, more lengthy product and development cycles are possible, depending on the scope and nature of the project. A portable consumer device typically has a product life cycle of six to 18 months. In the infrastructure market, the product life cycle can range from 24 to 60 months.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our historical operating results for the periods

</tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of HD video and image processing SoC solutions to OEMs and ODMs, either directly or through our logistics providers. Our SoC solutions have been used in the camera and infrastructure markets, although we expect the primary market for our solutions for the foreseeable future will be in the camera market as the infrastructure market continues to decline due to delays in investments in network upgrades. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales made indirectly through our logistics provider, Wintech Microelectronics Co., Ltd., or Wintech, and directly to one large ODM customer, Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd., or Chicony.\nWe typically experience seasonal fluctuations in our quarterly revenue with our third fiscal quarter normally being the highest revenue quarter. This fluctuation has been driven primarily by increased sales in the camera market as our customers build inventories in preparation for the holiday shopping season. More generally, our average selling prices fluctuate based on the mix of our solutions sold in a period which reflects the impact of both changes in unit sales of existing solutions as well as the introduction and sales of new solutions. Our solutions are typically characterized by a life cycle that begins with higher average selling prices and lower volumes, followed by broader market adoption, higher volumes and average selling prices that are lower than initial levels.\nThe end markets into which we sell our products have seen significant changes as consumer preferences have evolved in response to new technologies. As a result, the composition of our revenue may differ meaningfully during periods of technology or consumer preference changes. We expect shifts in consumer use of video capture to continue to change over time, as more specialized use cases emerge and video capture continues to proliferate.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nCost of revenue includes the cost of materials such as wafers processed by third-party foundries, costs associated with packaging, assembly and test, and our manufacturing support operations such as logistics, planning and quality assurance. Cost of revenue also includes indirect costs such as warranty, inventory valuation reserves and other general overhead costs.\nWe expect that our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as a result of changes in average selling price, product mix and the introduction of new products by us or our competitors. In general, solutions incorporated into more complex configurations, such as those used in high-performance cameras or infrastructure applications, have higher prices and higher gross margins, as compared to solutions sold into the lower performance, more competitive camera applications. As semiconductor products mature and unit volumes sold to customers increase, their average selling prices typically decline. These declines may be paired with improvements in manufacturing yields and lower wafer, packaging and test costs, which offset some of the margin reduction that could result from lower selling prices. We believe that our gross margin will decline in the future as we continue to penetrate the highly competitive camera market.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation and employee benefits. The expense also includes costs of development incurred in connection with our collaborations with our foundry vendors, costs of licensing intellectual property from third parties for product development, costs of development for software and hardware tools, cost of fabrication of mask sets for prototype products, and allocated depreciation and facility expenses. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to enhance and expand our product features and offerings.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation and employee benefits for our sales, marketing, finance, human resources, information technology and administrative personnel. The expense also includes professional service costs related to accounting, tax, legal services, and allocated depreciation and facility expenses. We expect our selling expense to increase in absolute dollars as we expand the size of our sales and marketing organization to support our anticipated growth. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue as we continue to maintain the infrastructure necessary to operate as a public company, which includes increased audit and legal fees, costs to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market, investor relations costs, and higher insurance premiums.\nOther Income (Loss), Net\nOther income (loss), net consists primarily of investment interest income and gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and remeasurements.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are incorporated in the Cayman Islands and conduct business in several countries such as the United States, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Italy and Japan, and we are subject to taxation in those jurisdictions. As such, our worldwide operating income is subject to varying tax rates and our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses and the tax laws and regulations in each geographical region. Consequently, we have experienced lower effective tax rates as a substantial percentage of our operations are conducted in lower-tax jurisdictions. If our operational structure was to change in such a manner that would increase the amount of operating income subject to taxation in higher-tax jurisdictions, or if we were to commence operations in jurisdictions assessing relatively higher tax rates, our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and/or be adversely affected.\nComparison of the Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 316,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 218,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 157,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue increased for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to strong demand for our A9, A7L, S2L and A12 SoCs in the IP security, UAV, automotive aftermarket and wearable sports camera markets. The strong growth in the IP security camera markets reflected a broader adoption of our S2L SoC by current customers in the professional security market as well as the addition of new customers in the home security and monitoring market. Despite the strong revenue growth in the IP security camera market, we experienced some softness in the China region in the second half of fiscal year 2016, which partially offset stronger results in other geographic regions in the period.

Although the revenue in the wearable sports camera market increased in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015, we saw a decline in this market in the second half of fiscal year 2016 as a result of high inventory levels at a major end customer. In addition, we anticipate that these high inventory levels at our customer in the wearable sports camera market will significantly and adversely impact our revenues in fiscal year 2017, particularly the first half of the fiscal year.\nFor the twelve months ended January 31, 2016, the increases in the camera markets were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in the infrastructure market resulting from continued weak market conditions in the United States and Europe, as system manufacturers continue to delay investment in network upgrades to the new H.265 compression technology. Infrastructure revenue declined as a percentage of total revenue from 6.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2015 to 3.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2016. We anticipate that infrastructure revenue will continue to decline as a percentage of our total revenue for the foreseeable future.\nRevenue increased for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014 primarily due to strong demand for our A5S, A7L and A9 SoCs in the IP security, wearable sports and automotive aftermarket camera markets. In addition, the initial ramp of our A5S and A9 chips into the UAV market also contributed to the revenue growth in fiscal year 2015. The increase was partially offset by a year over year decline in the infrastructure market as a result of continued weak market conditions in the United States and Europe, as system manufacturers have delayed investment in network upgrades to the new H.265 compression technology. Infrastructure revenue declined as a percentage of total revenue from 12.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2014 to 6.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2015.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 111,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 79,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 205,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 139,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue increased for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to increases in the number of SoCs sold into the camera market. The increases were partially offset by cost reductions received from suppliers for certain SoCs due to increased purchase volumes.\nGross margin increased for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to a higher percentage of revenues associated with shipments of our higher gross margin A9 and A7L chips into the wearable sports, UAV and automotive camera markets. The increases were partially offset by continuing revenue declines in the higher gross margin infrastructure business, and for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, the introduction of the lower margin S2L SoC into the price competitive Asia IP security camera market. We anticipate that gross margin will decrease over the next twelve months as revenues from the Asia IP security camera market and the consumer IP security market grow as a percentage of our total revenue.

Our research and development engineering headcount increased to 460 at January 31, 2016 compared to 365 at January 31, 2015, including 33 employees hired as a result of the VisLab acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. The increased engineering headcount resulted in an increase in salary related expenses of approximately $7.8 million in fiscal year 2016. The increases were also attributable to additional stock-based compensation of approximately $10.4 million in fiscal year 2016, as a result of the issuance of options and restricted stock units for newly hired employees, our annual evergreen stock program for existing employees and the increase in the stock price of our ordinary shares in the first half of fiscal year 2016. The product development costs expended on our next generation SoCs increased by approximately $8.0 million in fiscal year 2016. The increased product development costs were partially offset by $2.5 million in payments from customers who agreed to share development costs for the twelve months ended January 31, 2016. The increased engineering headcount also resulted in additional facility allocation costs of approximately $1.4 million for the twelve months ended January 31, 2016.\nResearch and development expense increased for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in engineering headcount, product development costs and facility allocation costs.

The increases were also attributable to additional stock-based compensation of approximately $3.6 million in fiscal year 2015, as a result of the issuance of options and restricted stock units for newly hired employees, our annual evergreen stock program for existing employees and the employee stock purchase plan. The product development costs expended on the development of our next generation SoCs increased by approximately $1.9 million in fiscal year 2015. The increased development costs were partially offset by a $0.9 million in payment from one customer who agreed to share development costs. In fiscal year 2014, we entered into a lease agreement for our new headquarters located in Santa Clara, California, and in fiscal year 2015, we continued the expansion of our enterprise resource planning system, resulting in additional facility allocation costs of approximately $1.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in headcount and outside professional services.

activities increased primarily due to increased net income as adjusted for increased non-cash stock-based compensation. The increase was also attributable to decreased accounts receivable associated with the timing of payments from customers, decreased inventory purchases associated with a decrease in our near term revenue forecasts, increased deferred revenue associated with the timing of inventory shipments by our logistics providers and increased long-term liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The increase was partially offset by decreased liabilities associated with the timing of payments to suppliers as well as income tax payables.\nFiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014: Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to increased net income, adjusted for increased non-cash stock-based compensation, and increased liabilities associated with the timing of payments to suppliers as well as income tax payables. The increase was partially offset by increased accounts receivable associated with higher revenues and the timing of payments from customers, increased inventory purchases to support continuing growth of sales, increased deferred tax assets as a result of higher stock-based compensation, as well as decreased deferred revenue from the timing of shipments to our logistics provider and resulting sell-through revenue recognition.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nFiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015: Net cash used in investing activities decreased primarily due to the receipt of approximately $28.6 million in cash from selling and maturities of debt securities and approximately $7.0 million less of debt securities purchased during the period. The decrease was partially offset by the payment of $30.0 million for the acquisition of VisLab in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016.\nFiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014: Net cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to $40.0 million investments in highly liquid, short-term marketable securities, net of cash receipts from the sale or maturity of a portion of these investments.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nFiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015: Net cash provided by financing activities decreased primarily due to approximately $2.4 million of decreased option exercises and approximately $3.3 million less of excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation.\nFiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014: Net cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to an additional $2.1 million in cash proceeds from option exercises and contributions from participants in the employee stock purchase plan and an additional $2.4 million of recognized excess tax benefits from increased stock-based compensation.\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of January 31, 2016 and 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $307.9 million and $208.0 million, respectively. In fiscal year 2015, we invested $40.0 million in highly liquid, short-term marketable securities. We hold these investments as available-for-sale securities and mark them to market. As of January 31, 2016, these securities had a fair value of approximately $40.4 million with insignificant unrealized losses caused by fluctuations in market value and interest rates.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe have generated net income in each quarter beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, and we have generated cash from operations in each of fiscal years 2009 to 2016. We believe that our anticipated cash generated from operations and our existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. In the future, we expect our operating and capital expenditures to increase as we increase headcount, expand our business activities, and implement and enhance our information technology platforms. We expect our accounts receivable and inventory balances to increase, and could be partially offset by increases in accounts payable, which will result in a greater need for working capital. If our available cash balances are insufficient to satisfy our future liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell equity or convertible debt securities or borrow funds commercially. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our shareholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our ordinary shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities, these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. We may require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. Additional capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all.\nOur short- term and long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the following:\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> our ability to generate cash from operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> our ability to control our costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the emergence of competing or complementary technologies or products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, or participating in litigation-related activities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> our acquisition of complementary businesses, products and technologies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of January 31, 2016:\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payment Due by Period as of January 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> All\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facilities under operating leases (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology license or other obligations under\noperating leases (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrecognized tax benefits, including interest (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Facilities under operating leases represent facilities with initial lease terms in excess of one year.

We recognize that these stock-based awards dilute existing shareholders and have sought to limit the number of shares granted while providing competitive compensation packages. As of January 31, 2016, a total of 4.0 million outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units, will potentially dilute our earnings per share. This potential dilution will only result if outstanding options vest and are exercised and restricted stock and restricted stock units vest and are settled. As of January 31, 2016, 90% of our outstanding options had exercise prices less than the then market price of our ordinary shares.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of January 31, 2016, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report, for a full description of recent accounting standards, including the respective dates of adoption and effects on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Management Estimates\nThe preparation of audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to (i) the collectibility of accounts receivable; (ii) write down of excess and obsolete inventories; (iii) intangible assets and goodwill; (iv) the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets; (v) impairment of long-lived assets and financial instruments; (vi) warranty obligations; (vii) the valuation of stock-based compensation awards and financial instruments; (viii) the probability of performance objectives achievement; (ix) the realization of tax assets and estimates of tax liabilities, including reserves for uncertain tax positions; and (x) the recognition and disclosure of contingent liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We may engage third-party valuation specialists to assist with estimates related to the valuation of financial instruments and assets associated with various contractual arrangements. Such estimates often require the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and significant judgment. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or circumstances and such differences could be material.\nWe believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgment and estimates:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from the sales of our SoCs to OEMs or ODMs, either directly or through logistics providers. Revenue from sales directly to OEMs and ODMs is recognized upon shipment provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, legal title to the products and risk of ownership have transferred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. We provide our logistics providers with the rights to return excess levels of inventory and to future price adjustments. Given the inability to reasonably estimate these price changes and returns, revenue and costs related to shipments to logistics providers are deferred until we receive notification from our logistics providers that they have sold our products. Information reported by our logistics providers includes product resale price, quantity and end customer shipment information as well as remaining inventory on hand. At the time of shipment to a logistics provider, we record a trade receivable as there is a legally enforceable right to receive payment, reduce inventory for the value of goods shipped as legal title has passed to the logistics provider and defer the related margin as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Any price adjustments are recorded as a change to deferred revenue at the time the adjustments are agreed upon.\nArrangements with certain OEM customers provide for pricing that is dependent upon the end products into which our SoCs are used. These arrangements may also entitle us to a share of the product margin ultimately realized by the OEM. The minimum guaranteed amount of revenue related to the sale of products subject to these arrangements is recognized when all other elements of revenue recognition are met. Any amounts at the date of shipment invoiced in excess of the minimum guaranteed contract price are deferred until the additional amounts we are entitled to are fixed or determinable. Additional amounts earned by us resulting from margin sharing arrangements and determination of the end products into which the products are ultimately incorporated are recognized when end customer sales volume is reported to us.\nWe also enter into engineering service agreements with certain customers. These agreements may include multiple deliverables, such as software development services, licensing of intellectual property and post-contract customer support, or PCS. We do not sell separately any of these components and do not have Vendor Specific Objective Evidence, or VSOE, for the deliverables. Accordingly, revenues from these agreements are deferred for any amounts billed until delivery of all the elements. If the agreements include PCS, the revenues are recognized ratably over the estimated supporting periods. The revenue from engineering service agreements was not material for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments that are highly liquid with original maturities at the time of purchase greater than three months are considered as marketable securities.\nWe classify these investments as available-for-sale\u201d securities carried at fair value, based on quoted market prices of similar assets, with the unrealized gains or losses reported, net of tax, as a separate component of shareholders' equity and included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets. The amortization of security premiums and accretion of discounts and the realized gains and losses are both recorded in other income (loss), net in the consolidated statements of operations. We review our investments for possible other-than-temporary impairments on a regular basis. If any loss on investment is believed to be other-than-temporary, a charge will be recorded and a new cost basis in the investment will be established. In evaluating whether a loss on a security is other-than-temporary, we consider the following factors: 1) general market conditions, 2) the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, 3) our intent and ability to hold the investment.\nFor securities in an unrealized loss position which is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the difference between the security's then-current amortized cost basis and fair value is separated into (i) the amount of the impairment related to the credit loss (i.e., the credit loss component) and (ii) the amount of the impairment related to all other factors (i.e., the non-credit loss component). The credit loss component is recognized in earnings. The non-credit loss component is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Due to the relative short term nature of the investments, there have been no other-than-temporary impairments recorded to date.\nInventory Valuation\nWe record inventories at the lower of cost or market. The cost includes materials and other production costs and is computed using standard cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory reserves are recorded for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based on forecast of future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected, or if future demand for the Company's products decreases, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Once inventory is written down, a new accounting cost basis is established and, accordingly, any associated reserve is not reversed until the inventory is sold or scrapped. There have been no material inventory losses recognized to date.\nBusiness Combinations and Intangible Assets\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets, our management makes significant estimates and assumptions.\nCritical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, replacement cost. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nGoodwill and In-Process Research and Development\nGoodwill and in-process research and development (IPR&D) are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. We have a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment test purposes based on our business and reporting structure.\nWe do not amortize goodwill. Acquired in process research and development, or IPR&D, is capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset and amortization commences upon completion of the underlying projects. When a project underlying reported IPR&D is completed, the corresponding amount of IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock-based compensation for equity awards granted to employees and directors based on the estimated fair value on the grant date, and recognize that compensation as expense using the straight-line attribution method for service condition awards or using the graded-vesting attribution method for awards with performance conditions over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period of each award. We determine the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units based on the fair market value of our ordinary shares on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. Determining the fair value of stock options on the grant date requires the input of various assumptions, including stock price of the underlying ordinary share, the exercise price of the stock option, expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend rate. The expected term is calculated using the simplified method as prescribed in the guidance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as neither relevant historical experience nor other relevant data are available to estimate future exercise behavior. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatilities of similar companies whose share prices are publicly available for a period commensurate with the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the average U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates during the respective periods commensurate with the expected term. The expected dividend yield is zero because we have not historically paid dividends and have no present intention to pay dividends. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting award forfeitures and record stock-based compensation only for those awards that are expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimates.\nWe recognize non-employee stock-based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the equity instrument. The fair value of the non-employee awards is remeasured at each reporting period until services required under the arrangement are completed, which is the vesting date.\nNet Income Per Ordinary Share\nWe apply the two-class method to calculate and present net income per ordinary share. Under the two-class method, net income is allocated between ordinary shares and other participating securities based on their participating rights. Participating securities are defined as securities that may participate in undistributed earnings with ordinary shares, whether that participation is conditioned upon the occurrence of a specified event or not. Basic net income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income allocable to ordinary shares by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income allocable to ordinary shares and income allocable to participating securities, to the extent they are dilutive, by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding, including the dilutive effects of participating securities on an if-converted basis plus the dilutive effects of ordinary shares. Our potential dilutive ordinary share equivalents consist of incremental ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of options, upon the issuance of shares pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and upon release of vested restricted stock and restricted stock units.\nWe perform an assessment as to whether instruments granted in stock-based payment transactions are participating securities. Stock-based payment awards that have not yet vested meet the definition of a participating security provided the right to receive the dividend is non-forfeitable and non-contingent. These participating securities should be included in the computation of basic net income per ordinary share under the two-class method. We have concluded that our non-vested early-exercised options meet the definition of a participating security and should be included in the computation of basic net income per ordinary share.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nWe apply authoritative guidance for the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The guidance requires that tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. Upon estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, we consider and evaluate numerous factors, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not reflect the final tax liabilities. We adjust our financial statements to reflect only those tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained under examination.\nAs part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets. In general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in the consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws, or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized.\nIn assessing whether deferred tax assets may be realized, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income.\nWe make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates. Should the actual amounts differ from estimates, the amount of valuation allowance could be materially impacted. Any adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the periods in which the adjustment is determined to be required.\nTable 168: <table> <tr>

OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nWe are a leading developer of semiconductor processing solutions for video that enable high-definition, or HD, video capture, sharing and display. We combine our processor design capabilities with our expertise in video and image processing algorithms and software to provide a technology platform that is designed to be easily scalable across multiple applications and enable rapid and efficient product development. Our system-on-a-chip, or SoC, designs fully integrate HD video processing, image processing, audio processing and system functions onto a single chip, delivering exceptional video and image quality, differentiated functionality and low power consumption.\nWe sell our solutions to leading original design manufacturers, or ODMs, and original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, globally. We refer to ODMs as our customers and OEMs as our end customers, except as otherwise indicated or as the context otherwise requires. In the camera market, our solutions enable the creation of high-quality video content primarily for wearable sports cameras, Internet Protocol, or IP, security cameras, unmanned aerial vehicle cameras, also referred to as UAVs, drones or flying cameras, and automotive aftermarket cameras. In the infrastructure market, our solutions efficiently manage IP video traffic, broadcast encoding, transcoding and IP video delivery applications.\nOur sales cycles typically require a significant investment of time and a substantial expenditure of resources before we can realize revenue from the sale of our solutions, if any. Our typical sales cycle consists of a multi-month sales and development process involving our customers' system designers and management along with our sales personnel and software engineers. If successful, this process culminates in a customer's decision to use our solutions in its system, which we refer to as a design win. Our sales efforts are typically directed to the OEM of the product that will incorporate our video and image processing solution, but the eventual design and incorporation of our SoC into the product may be handled by an ODM on behalf of the OEM. Volume production may begin within six to 18 months after a design win, depending on the complexity of our customer's product and other factors upon which we may have little or no influence. Once one of our solutions has been incorporated into a customer's design, we believe that our solution is likely to remain a component of the customer's product for its life cycle because of the time and expense associated with redesigning a product or substituting an alternative solution. Conversely, a design loss to a competitor will likely preclude any opportunity for us to generate future revenue from such customer's product. Even if we obtain a design win and our SoC remains a component through the life cycle of a customer's product, the volume and timing of actual sales of our SoCs to the customer depend upon the production, release and market acceptance of that product, none of which are within our control.\nFiscal Year 2016 Financial Highlights and Trends\n \u00b7 We recorded revenue of $316.4 million, an increase of 44.9% as compared to fiscal year 2015. The increase over the prior fiscal year was primarily due to strong demand for our A9, A7L, S2L and A12 SoCs in the IP security, UAV, automotive aftermarket and wearable sports camera markets. The strong growth in the IP security camera market reflected a broader adoption of our S2L SoC by current customers in the professional security market as well as the addition of new customers in the home security and monitoring market. Despite the strong revenue growth in the IP security camera market, we experienced some softness in the China region in the second half of fiscal year 2016, which partially offset stronger results in other geographic regions in the period. Although UAVs are in the early stage of market adoption, we experienced strong growth in fiscal year 2016 due to the launch of new models from an existing customer and initial adoption by new customers. In the automotive aftermarket, which is dominated by demand from Asia, revenues grew as customer demand for more feature-rich products increased which is well suited to our product offerings. Although the revenue in the wearable sports camera market increased in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015, we saw a decline in this market in the second half of fiscal year 2016 as a result of high inventory levels at a major end customer. In addition, we anticipate that these high inventory levels at our customer in the wearable sports camera market will significantly and adversely impact our revenues in fiscal year 2017, particularly the first half of the fiscal year. For the twelve months ended January 31, 2016, the increases in the camera market was partially offset by a year-over-year decline in the infrastructure market resulting from continued weak market conditions in the United States and Europe as system manufacturers continue to delay investment in network upgrades to the new H.265 compression technology. \n \u00b7 We recorded operating income of $84.7 million, an increase of 63.3% as compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to continuing growth in revenues, as well as efficient control of product costs and operating expenses. \n \u00b7 We generated cash flows from operating activities of $123.6 million in fiscal year 2016, as compared to $52.3 million in fiscal year 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased net income as adjusted for increased non-cash stock-based compensation. The increase also was attributable to decreased accounts receivable associated with the timing of payments from customers, decreased inventory purchase associated with a decrease in near term revenue forecasts, increased deferred revenue associated with the timing of inventory shipments by our logistics providers and increased long-term liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The increase was partially offset by decreased liabilities associated with the timing of payments to suppliers as well as income tax payables. \n \u00b7 On June 25, 2015, we completed the acquisition of VisLab S.r.l., a privately-held Italian company that develops computer vision and intelligent control systems for automotive and other commercial applications, including Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and several generations of autonomous vehicle driving systems, for $30.0 million in cash. Of this total purchase price, $4.1 million was attributed to intangible assets, $25.3 million was attributed to goodwill, and $0.6 million was attributed to net assets acquired. \nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nDesign Wins. We closely monitor design wins by customer and end market. We consider design wins to be critical to our future success, although a design win may not successfully materialize into revenue, and even if they result in revenue, the amount generated by each design win can vary significantly. Our long-term sales expectations are based on forecasts from customers and internal estimations of customer demand factoring in the expected time to market for end customer products incorporating our solutions and associated revenue potential. Our ability to accurately forecast demand, however, can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including inaccurate forecasting by our customers, miscalculations by our customers of their inventory requirements, changes in market conditions, adverse changes in our product order mix and fluctuating demand for our customers' products.\nPricing, Product Cost and Margin. Our pricing and margins depend on the volumes and the features of the solutions we provide to our customers. Additionally, we make significant investments in new solutions for both cost improvements and new features that we expect to drive revenue and maintain margins. In general, solutions incorporated into more complex configurations, such as those used in high-performance camera or infrastructure applications, have higher prices and higher gross margins as compared to solutions sold into lower performing, more competitive camera applications. Our average selling price, or ASP, can vary by market and application due to market-specific supply and demand, the maturation of products launched in previous years and the launch of new products.\nWe continually monitor the cost of our solutions. As we rely on third-party manufacturers for the production of our products, we maintain a close relationship with these suppliers to continually monitor production yields, component costs and design efficiencies.\nShifting Consumer Preferences. Our revenue is subject to consumer preferences, regarding form factor and functionality, and how those preferences impact the video and image capture electronics that we support. For example, improved smartphone video capture capabilities, and the rapid adoption by consumers, led to the decline of pocket video cameras aimed at the video and image capture market. The current video and image capture market is now characterized by a greater volume of more specialized video and image capture devices that are less likely to be replaced with smartphones, such as wearable, including sports, IP security, UAV and automotive aftermarket cameras. This increasing specialization of video capture devices has changed our customer base and end markets and has impacted our revenue. In the future, we expect further changes in the market to continue to impact our business performance.\nContinued Concentration of Revenue by End Market. Historically, our revenue has been significantly concentrated in a small number of end markets. In fiscal year 2010, the majority of our revenue came from the pocket video, camcorder and infrastructure markets. Since that time, we have developed technologies to provide solutions for new markets such as the wearable, including sports, IP security, UAV and automotive aftermarket camera markets. We believe these new markets can continue to facilitate revenue growth and customer diversification. Since fiscal year 2013, the wearable sports and IP security markets have been our largest end markets and sales into these markets collectively generated the majority of our revenue. While we will continue to expand our end market exposure, such as to non-sports wearable cameras and UAVs, we anticipate that sales to a limited number of end markets will continue to account for a significant percentage of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. Our end market concentration may cause our financial performance to fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the success or failure of products that our SoCs are designed into as well as the overall growth or decline in the video capture markets in which we compete. In addition, we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of ODMs who build products on behalf of a limited number of OEMs and from a limited number of OEMs to whom we ship directly. We believe that our operating results for the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers.\nAbility to Capitalize on Connectivity Trend. Mobile connected devices are ubiquitous today and play an increasingly prominent role in consumers' lives. The constant connectivity provided by these devices has created a demand for connected electronic peripherals such as video and image capture devices. Our ability to capitalize on these trends by supporting our end customers in the development of connected peripherals that seamlessly cooperate with other connected devices and allow consumers to distribute and share video and images with online media platforms is critical for our success. We have added wireless communication functionality into our solutions for wearable, including sports, IP security, UAV and automotive aftermarket cameras. The combination of our compression technology with wireless connectivity enables wireless video streaming and uploading of videos and images to the Internet. Our solutions enable IP security camera systems to stream video content to either cloud infrastructure or connected mobile devices, and our solutions for wearable, including sports, and UAV cameras allow consumers to quickly stream or upload video and images to social media platforms.\nSales Volume. A typical camera design win that successfully launches into the marketplace can generate a wide range of sales volumes for our solutions, depending on the end market demand for our customers' products. This can depend on several factors, including the reputation of the end customer, market penetration, product capabilities, size of the end market that the product addresses and our end customers' ability to sell their products. In certain cases, we may provide volume discounts on sales of our solutions, which may be offset by lower manufacturing costs related to higher volumes. In general, our customers with greater market penetration and better branding tend to develop products that generate larger volumes over the product life cycle.\nCustomer Product Life Cycle. We estimate our customers' product life cycles based on the customer, type of product and end market. In general, products launched in the camera market have shorter life cycles than those sold into the infrastructure market. We typically commence commercial shipments from six to 18 months following a design win; however, in some markets, more lengthy product and development cycles are possible, depending on the scope and nature of the project. A portable consumer device typically has a product life cycle of six to 18 months. In the infrastructure market, the product life cycle can range from 24 to 60 months.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our historical operating results for the periods indicated:\n\nThe following table sets forth our historical operating results as a percentage of revenue of each line item for the periods indicated:\n\nRevenue\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of HD video and image processing SoC solutions to OEMs and ODMs, either directly or through our logistics providers. Our SoC solutions have been used in the camera and infrastructure markets, although we expect the primary market for our solutions for the foreseeable future will be in the camera market as the infrastructure market continues to decline due to delays in investments in network upgrades. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales made indirectly through our logistics provider, Wintech Microelectronics Co., Ltd., or Wintech, and directly to one large ODM customer, Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd., or Chicony.\nWe typically experience seasonal fluctuations in our quarterly revenue with our third fiscal quarter normally being the highest revenue quarter. This fluctuation has been driven primarily by increased sales in the camera market as our customers build inventories in preparation for the holiday shopping season. More generally, our average selling prices fluctuate based on the mix of our solutions sold in a period which reflects the impact of both changes in unit sales of existing solutions as well as the introduction and sales of new solutions. Our solutions are typically characterized by a life cycle that begins with higher average selling prices and lower volumes, followed by broader market adoption, higher volumes and average selling prices that are lower than initial levels.\nThe end markets into which we sell our products have seen significant changes as consumer preferences have evolved in response to new technologies. As a result, the composition of our revenue may differ meaningfully during periods of technology or consumer preference changes. We expect shifts in consumer use of video capture to continue to change over time, as more specialized use cases emerge and video capture continues to proliferate.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nCost of revenue includes the cost of materials such as wafers processed by third-party foundries, costs associated with packaging, assembly and test, and our manufacturing support operations such as logistics, planning and quality assurance. Cost of revenue also includes indirect costs such as warranty, inventory valuation reserves and other general overhead costs.\nWe expect that our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as a result of changes in average selling price, product mix and the introduction of new products by us or our competitors. In general, solutions incorporated into more complex configurations, such as those used in high-performance cameras or infrastructure applications, have higher prices and higher gross margins, as compared to solutions sold into the lower performance, more competitive camera applications. As semiconductor products mature and unit volumes sold to customers increase, their average selling prices typically decline. These declines may be paired with improvements in manufacturing yields and lower wafer, packaging and test costs, which offset some of the margin reduction that could result from lower selling prices. We believe that our gross margin will decline in the future as we continue to penetrate the highly competitive camera market.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation and employee benefits. The expense also includes costs of development incurred in connection with our collaborations with our foundry vendors, costs of licensing intellectual property from third parties for product development, costs of development for software and hardware tools, cost of fabrication of mask sets for prototype products, and allocated depreciation and facility expenses. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to enhance and expand our product features and offerings.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation and employee benefits for our sales, marketing, finance, human resources, information technology and administrative personnel. The expense also includes professional service costs related to accounting, tax, legal services, and allocated depreciation and facility expenses. We expect our selling expense to increase in absolute dollars as we expand the size of our sales and marketing organization to support our anticipated growth. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue as we continue to maintain the infrastructure necessary to operate as a public company, which includes increased audit and legal fees, costs to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market, investor relations costs, and higher insurance premiums.\nOther Income (Loss), Net\nOther income (loss), net consists primarily of investment interest income and gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and remeasurements.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are incorporated in the Cayman Islands and conduct business in several countries such as the United States, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Italy and Japan, and we are subject to taxation in those jurisdictions. As such, our worldwide operating income is subject to varying tax rates and our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses and the tax laws and regulations in each geographical region. Consequently, we have experienced lower effective tax rates as a substantial percentage of our operations are conducted in lower-tax jurisdictions. If our operational structure was to change in such a manner that would increase the amount of operating income subject to taxation in higher-tax jurisdictions, or if we were to commence operations in jurisdictions assessing relatively higher tax rates, our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and/or be adversely affected.\nComparison of the Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue\n\nRevenue increased for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to strong demand for our A9, A7L, S2L and A12 SoCs in the IP security, UAV, automotive aftermarket and wearable sports camera markets. The strong growth in the IP security camera markets reflected a broader adoption of our S2L SoC by current customers in the professional security market as well as the addition of new customers in the home security and monitoring market. Despite the strong revenue growth in the IP security camera market, we experienced some softness in the China region in the second half of fiscal year 2016, which partially offset stronger results in other geographic regions in the period. Although UAVs are in the early stage of market adoption, we experienced strong growth in fiscal year 2016 due to the launch of new models from an existing customer and initial adoption by new customers. In the automotive aftermarket, which is dominated by demand from Asia, revenues grew as customer demand for more feature-rich products increased which is well suited to our product offerings. Although the revenue in the wearable sports camera market increased in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015, we saw a decline in this market in the second half of fiscal year 2016 as a result of high inventory levels at a major end customer. In addition, we anticipate that these high inventory levels at our customer in the wearable sports camera market will significantly and adversely impact our revenues in fiscal year 2017, particularly the first half of the fiscal year.\nFor the twelve months ended January 31, 2016, the increases in the camera markets were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in the infrastructure market resulting from continued weak market conditions in the United States and Europe, as system manufacturers continue to delay investment in network upgrades to the new H.265 compression technology. Infrastructure revenue declined as a percentage of total revenue from 6.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2015 to 3.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2016. We anticipate that infrastructure revenue will continue to decline as a percentage of our total revenue for the foreseeable future.\nRevenue increased for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014 primarily due to strong demand for our A5S, A7L and A9 SoCs in the IP security, wearable sports and automotive aftermarket camera markets. In addition, the initial ramp of our A5S and A9 chips into the UAV market also contributed to the revenue growth in fiscal year 2015. The increase was partially offset by a year over year decline in the infrastructure market as a result of continued weak market conditions in the United States and Europe, as system manufacturers have delayed investment in network upgrades to the new H.265 compression technology. Infrastructure revenue declined as a percentage of total revenue from 12.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2014 to 6.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2015.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\n\nCost of revenue increased for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to increases in the number of SoCs sold into the camera market. The increases were partially offset by cost reductions received from suppliers for certain SoCs due to increased purchase volumes.\nGross margin increased for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to a higher percentage of revenues associated with shipments of our higher gross margin A9 and A7L chips into the wearable sports, UAV and automotive camera markets. The increases were partially offset by continuing revenue declines in the higher gross margin infrastructure business, and for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, the introduction of the lower margin S2L SoC into the price competitive Asia IP security camera market. We anticipate that gross margin will decrease over the next twelve months as revenues from the Asia IP security camera market and the consumer IP security market grow as a percentage of our total revenue. Infrastructure revenue declined as a percentage of total revenue from 12.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2014 to 6.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2015, and declined as a percentage of total revenue to 3.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2016.\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expense increased for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in engineering headcount, product development costs and facility allocation costs. Our research and development engineering headcount increased to 460 at January 31, 2016 compared to 365 at January 31, 2015, including 33 employees hired as a result of the VisLab acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. The increased engineering headcount resulted in an increase in salary related expenses of approximately $7.8 million in fiscal year 2016. The increases were also attributable to additional stock-based compensation of approximately $10.4 million in fiscal year 2016, as a result of the issuance of options and restricted stock units for newly hired employees, our annual evergreen stock program for existing employees and the increase in the stock price of our ordinary shares in the first half of fiscal year 2016. The product development costs expended on our next generation SoCs increased by approximately $8.0 million in fiscal year 2016. The increased product development costs were partially offset by $2.5 million in payments from customers who agreed to share development costs for the twelve months ended January 31, 2016. The increased engineering headcount also resulted in additional facility allocation costs of approximately $1.4 million for the twelve months ended January 31, 2016.\nResearch and development expense increased for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in engineering headcount, product development costs and facility allocation costs. Our research and development engineering headcount increased to 365 at January 31, 2015 compared to 358 at January 31, 2014, resulting in an increase in salary related expenses of approximately $2.7 million in fiscal year 2015. The increases were also attributable to additional stock-based compensation of approximately $3.6 million in fiscal year 2015, as a result of the issuance of options and restricted stock units for newly hired employees, our annual evergreen stock program for existing employees and the employee stock purchase plan. The product development costs expended on the development of our next generation SoCs increased by approximately $1.9 million in fiscal year 2015. The increased development costs were partially offset by a $0.9 million in payment from one customer who agreed to share development costs. In fiscal year 2014, we entered into a lease agreement for our new headquarters located in Santa Clara, California, and in fiscal year 2015, we continued the expansion of our enterprise resource planning system, resulting in additional facility allocation costs of approximately $1.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in headcount and outside professional services. Our selling, general and administrative headcount increased to 163 at January 31, 2016 compared to 144 at January 31, 2015, resulting in an increase in salary related expenses of approximately $2.9 million in fiscal year 2016. The increases were also attributable to additional stock-based compensation of approximately $4.7 million in fiscal year 2016, as a result of the issuance of options, restricted stock and restricted stock units for newly hired employees, our annual evergreen stock program for existing employees and the increase in the stock price of our ordinary shares in the first half of fiscal year 2016. In addition, we incurred approximately $0.8 million of additional expenditures on outside professional services for the twelve months ended January 31, 2016 to support the VisLab acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014 primarily due to an additional $5.7 million in compensation as a result of increases in headcount and stock-based compensation from issuance of options and restricted stock units for newly hired employees, our annual evergreen stock program for existing employees and the employee stock purchase plan. In addition, we incurred approximately $0.7 million of additional expenditures on outside professional services to support the continued development of our enterprise resource planning system, to meet the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the compliance requirements of being a public company for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015.\nOther Income (Loss), Net\n\nThe increase in other income (loss), net, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 was primarily due to approximately $170,000 of additional net interest income from marketable security investments and an increase of approximately $178,000 of net gains from fluctuations in exchange rates in foreign currency transactions.\nThe increase in other income (loss), net, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014 was primarily due to approximately $150,000 of net interest income from marketable security investments.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense and effective tax rate increased in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to a favorable change in our geographic mix of profits, offset by a $6.1 million of valuation allowance related to our U.S. federal research and development credit carryforwards.\nIncome tax expense and effective tax rate decreased in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a favorable change in our geographic mix of profits as well as an increase in federal research and development credit, partially offset by non-deductible stock-based compensation expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nFiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015: Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to increased net income as adjusted for increased non-cash stock-based compensation. The increase was also attributable to decreased accounts receivable associated with the timing of payments from customers, decreased inventory purchases associated with a decrease in our near term revenue forecasts, increased deferred revenue associated with the timing of inventory shipments by our logistics providers and increased long-term liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The increase was partially offset by decreased liabilities associated with the timing of payments to suppliers as well as income tax payables.\nFiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014: Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to increased net income, adjusted for increased non-cash stock-based compensation, and increased liabilities associated with the timing of payments to suppliers as well as income tax payables. The increase was partially offset by increased accounts receivable associated with higher revenues and the timing of payments from customers, increased inventory purchases to support continuing growth of sales, increased deferred tax assets as a result of higher stock-based compensation, as well as decreased deferred revenue from the timing of shipments to our logistics provider and resulting sell-through revenue recognition.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nFiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015: Net cash used in investing activities decreased primarily due to the receipt of approximately $28.6 million in cash from selling and maturities of debt securities and approximately $7.0 million less of debt securities purchased during the period. The decrease was partially offset by the payment of $30.0 million for the acquisition of VisLab in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016.\nFiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014: Net cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to $40.0 million investments in highly liquid, short-term marketable securities, net of cash receipts from the sale or maturity of a portion of these investments.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nFiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015: Net cash provided by financing activities decreased primarily due to approximately $2.4 million of decreased option exercises and approximately $3.3 million less of excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation.\nFiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014: Net cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to an additional $2.1 million in cash proceeds from option exercises and contributions from participants in the employee stock purchase plan and an additional $2.4 million of recognized excess tax benefits from increased stock-based compensation.\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of January 31, 2016 and 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $307.9 million and $208.0 million, respectively. In fiscal year 2015, we invested $40.0 million in highly liquid, short-term marketable securities. We hold these investments as available-for-sale securities and mark them to market. As of January 31, 2016, these securities had a fair value of approximately $40.4 million with insignificant unrealized losses caused by fluctuations in market value and interest rates.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe have generated net income in each quarter beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, and we have generated cash from operations in each of fiscal years 2009 to 2016. We believe that our anticipated cash generated from operations and our existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. In the future, we expect our operating and capital expenditures to increase as we increase headcount, expand our business activities, and implement and enhance our information technology platforms. We expect our accounts receivable and inventory balances to increase, and could be partially offset by increases in accounts payable, which will result in a greater need for working capital. If our available cash balances are insufficient to satisfy our future liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell equity or convertible debt securities or borrow funds commercially. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our shareholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our ordinary shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities, these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. We may require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. Additional capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all.\nOur short- term and long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the following:\n \u00b7 our ability to generate cash from operations; \n \u00b7 our ability to control our costs; \n \u00b7 the emergence of competing or complementary technologies or products; \n \u00b7 the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, or participating in litigation-related activities; and \n \u00b7 our acquisition of complementary businesses, products and technologies. \nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of January 31, 2016:\n\n \n (1) Facilities under operating leases represent facilities with initial lease terms in excess of one year. They are located in Santa Clara (California), China, Hong Kong, and Japan. The lease for our Santa Clara headquarters has a seven-year term and terminates in fiscal year 2021. The lease for our Shanghai facility has a seven-year term and terminates in fiscal year 2018. The lease for our Shenzhen facility has a three-year term and terminates in fiscal year 2019. The Hong Kong facility has a three-year term and terminates in fiscal year 2017. The leases for our Japan facilities have two-year terms and terminate in fiscal year 2017 and 2018, respectively. \n (2) Technology license obligations under operating leases represent future cash payments for software or other technology licenses which are used in product design or daily operation. \n (3) Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchase obligations with our independent contract manufacturers. \n (4) Unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, represent our liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of January 31, 2016. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. \nStock Options and Restricted Stock Units\nGrants of stock-based awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain employees to align their interests with the interests of existing shareholders. We recognize that these stock-based awards dilute existing shareholders and have sought to limit the number of shares granted while providing competitive compensation packages. As of January 31, 2016, a total of 4.0 million outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units, will potentially dilute our earnings per share. This potential dilution will only result if outstanding options vest and are exercised and restricted stock and restricted stock units vest and are settled. As of January 31, 2016, 90% of our outstanding options had exercise prices less than the then market price of our ordinary shares.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of January 31, 2016, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report, for a full description of recent accounting standards, including the respective dates of adoption and effects on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Management Estimates\nThe preparation of audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to (i) the collectibility of accounts receivable; (ii) write down of excess and obsolete inventories; (iii) intangible assets and goodwill; (iv) the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets; (v) impairment of long-lived assets and financial instruments; (vi) warranty obligations; (vii) the valuation of stock-based compensation awards and financial instruments; (viii) the probability of performance objectives achievement; (ix) the realization of tax assets and estimates of tax liabilities, including reserves for uncertain tax positions; and (x) the recognition and disclosure of contingent liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We may engage third-party valuation specialists to assist with estimates related to the valuation of financial instruments and assets associated with various contractual arrangements. Such estimates often require the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and significant judgment. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or circumstances and such differences could be material.\nWe believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgment and estimates:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from the sales of our SoCs to OEMs or ODMs, either directly or through logistics providers. Revenue from sales directly to OEMs and ODMs is recognized upon shipment provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, legal title to the products and risk of ownership have transferred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. We provide our logistics providers with the rights to return excess levels of inventory and to future price adjustments. Given the inability to reasonably estimate these price changes and returns, revenue and costs related to shipments to logistics providers are deferred until we receive notification from our logistics providers that they have sold our products. Information reported by our logistics providers includes product resale price, quantity and end customer shipment information as well as remaining inventory on hand. At the time of shipment to a logistics provider, we record a trade receivable as there is a legally enforceable right to receive payment, reduce inventory for the value of goods shipped as legal title has passed to the logistics provider and defer the related margin as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Any price adjustments are recorded as a change to deferred revenue at the time the adjustments are agreed upon.\nArrangements with certain OEM customers provide for pricing that is dependent upon the end products into which our SoCs are used. These arrangements may also entitle us to a share of the product margin ultimately realized by the OEM. The minimum guaranteed amount of revenue related to the sale of products subject to these arrangements is recognized when all other elements of revenue recognition are met. Any amounts at the date of shipment invoiced in excess of the minimum guaranteed contract price are deferred until the additional amounts we are entitled to are fixed or determinable. Additional amounts earned by us resulting from margin sharing arrangements and determination of the end products into which the products are ultimately incorporated are recognized when end customer sales volume is reported to us.\nWe also enter into engineering service agreements with certain customers. These agreements may include multiple deliverables, such as software development services, licensing of intellectual property and post-contract customer support, or PCS. We do not sell separately any of these components and do not have Vendor Specific Objective Evidence, or VSOE, for the deliverables. Accordingly, revenues from these agreements are deferred for any amounts billed until delivery of all the elements. If the agreements include PCS, the revenues are recognized ratably over the estimated supporting periods. The revenue from engineering service agreements was not material for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments that are highly liquid with original maturities at the time of purchase greater than three months are considered as marketable securities.\nWe classify these investments as available-for-sale\u201d securities carried at fair value, based on quoted market prices of similar assets, with the unrealized gains or losses reported, net of tax, as a separate component of shareholders' equity and included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets. The amortization of security premiums and accretion of discounts and the realized gains and losses are both recorded in other income (loss), net in the consolidated statements of operations. We review our investments for possible other-than-temporary impairments on a regular basis. If any loss on investment is believed to be other-than-temporary, a charge will be recorded and a new cost basis in the investment will be established. In evaluating whether a loss on a security is other-than-temporary, we consider the following factors: 1) general market conditions, 2) the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, 3) our intent and ability to hold the investment.\nFor securities in an unrealized loss position which is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the difference between the security's then-current amortized cost basis and fair value is separated into (i) the amount of the impairment related to the credit loss (i.e., the credit loss component) and (ii) the amount of the impairment related to all other factors (i.e., the non-credit loss component). The credit loss component is recognized in earnings. The non-credit loss component is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Due to the relative short term nature of the investments, there have been no other-than-temporary impairments recorded to date.\nInventory Valuation\nWe record inventories at the lower of cost or market. The cost includes materials and other production costs and is computed using standard cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory reserves are recorded for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based on forecast of future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected, or if future demand for the Company's products decreases, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Once inventory is written down, a new accounting cost basis is established and, accordingly, any associated reserve is not reversed until the inventory is sold or scrapped. There have been no material inventory losses recognized to date.\nBusiness Combinations and Intangible Assets\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets, our management makes significant estimates and assumptions.\nCritical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, replacement cost. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nGoodwill and In-Process Research and Development\nGoodwill and in-process research and development (IPR&D) are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. We have a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment test purposes based on our business and reporting structure.\nWe do not amortize goodwill. Acquired in process research and development, or IPR&D, is capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset and amortization commences upon completion of the underlying projects. When a project underlying reported IPR&D is completed, the corresponding amount of IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock-based compensation for equity awards granted to employees and directors based on the estimated fair value on the grant date, and recognize that compensation as expense using the straight-line attribution method for service condition awards or using the graded-vesting attribution method for awards with performance conditions over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period of each award. We determine the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units based on the fair market value of our ordinary shares on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. Determining the fair value of stock options on the grant date requires the input of various assumptions, including stock price of the underlying ordinary share, the exercise price of the stock option, expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend rate. The expected term is calculated using the simplified method as prescribed in the guidance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as neither relevant historical experience nor other relevant data are available to estimate future exercise behavior. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatilities of similar companies whose share prices are publicly available for a period commensurate with the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the average U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates during the respective periods commensurate with the expected term. The expected dividend yield is zero because we have not historically paid dividends and have no present intention to pay dividends. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting award forfeitures and record stock-based compensation only for those awards that are expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimates.\nWe recognize non-employee stock-based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the equity instrument. The fair value of the non-employee awards is remeasured at each reporting period until services required under the arrangement are completed, which is the vesting date.\nNet Income Per Ordinary Share\nWe apply the two-class method to calculate and present net income per ordinary share. Under the two-class method, net income is allocated between ordinary shares and other participating securities based on their participating rights. Participating securities are defined as securities that may participate in undistributed earnings with ordinary shares, whether that participation is conditioned upon the occurrence of a specified event or not. Basic net income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income allocable to ordinary shares by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income allocable to ordinary shares and income allocable to participating securities, to the extent they are dilutive, by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding, including the dilutive effects of participating securities on an if-converted basis plus the dilutive effects of ordinary shares. Our potential dilutive ordinary share equivalents consist of incremental ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of options, upon the issuance of shares pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and upon release of vested restricted stock and restricted stock units.\nWe perform an assessment as to whether instruments granted in stock-based payment transactions are participating securities. Stock-based payment awards that have not yet vested meet the definition of a participating security provided the right to receive the dividend is non-forfeitable and non-contingent. These participating securities should be included in the computation of basic net income per ordinary share under the two-class method. We have concluded that our non-vested early-exercised options meet the definition of a participating security and should be included in the computation of basic net income per ordinary share.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nWe apply authoritative guidance for the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The guidance requires that tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. Upon estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, we consider and evaluate numerous factors, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not reflect the final tax liabilities. We adjust our financial statements to reflect only those tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained under examination.\nAs part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate actual current tax exposure together", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nWe are a leading developer of semiconductor processing solutions for video that enable high-definition, or HD, video capture, sharing and display. We combine our processor design capabilities with our expertise in video and image processing algorithms and software to provide a technology platform that is designed to be easily scalable across multiple applications and enable rapid and efficient product development. Our system-on-a-chip, or SoC, designs fully integrate HD video processing, image processing, audio processing and system functions onto a single chip, delivering exceptional video and image quality, differentiated functionality and low power consumption.\nWe sell our solutions to leading original design manufacturers, or ODMs, and original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, globally. We refer to ODMs as our customers and OEMs as our end customers, except as otherwise indicated or as the context otherwise requires. In the camera market, our solutions enable the creation of high-quality video content primarily for wearable sports cameras, Internet Protocol, or IP, security cameras, unmanned aerial vehicle cameras, also referred to as UAVs, drones or flying cameras, and automotive aftermarket cameras. In the infrastructure market, our solutions efficiently manage IP video traffic, broadcast encoding, transcoding and IP video delivery applications.\nOur sales cycles typically require a significant investment of time and a substantial expenditure of resources before we can realize revenue from the sale of our solutions, if any. Our typical sales cycle consists of a multi-month sales and development process involving our customers' system designers and management along with our sales personnel and software engineers. If successful, this process culminates in a customer's decision to use our solutions in its system, which we refer to as a design win. Our sales efforts are typically directed to the OEM of the product that will incorporate our video and image processing solution, but the eventual design and incorporation of our SoC into the product may be handled by an ODM on behalf of the OEM. Volume production may begin within six to 18 months after a design win, depending on the complexity of our customer's product and other factors upon which we may have little or no influence. Once one of our solutions has been incorporated into a customer's design, we believe that our solution is likely to remain a component of the customer's product for its life cycle because of the time and expense associated with redesigning a product or substituting an alternative solution. Conversely, a design loss to a competitor will likely preclude any opportunity for us to generate future revenue from such customer's product. Even if we obtain a design win and our SoC remains a component through the life cycle of a customer's product, the volume and timing of actual sales of our SoCs to the customer depend upon the production, release and market acceptance of that product, none of which are within our control.\nFiscal Year 2016 Financial Highlights and Trends\n \u00b7 We recorded revenue of $316.4 million, an increase of 44.9% as compared to fiscal year 2015. The increase over the prior fiscal year was primarily due to strong demand for our A9, A7L, S2L and A12 SoCs in the IP security, UAV, automotive aftermarket and wearable sports camera markets. The strong growth in the IP security camera market reflected a broader adoption of our S2L SoC by current customers in the professional security market as well as the addition of new customers in the home security and monitoring market. Despite the strong revenue growth in the IP security camera market, we experienced some softness in the China region in the second half of fiscal year 2016, which partially offset stronger results in other geographic regions in the period. Although UAVs are in the early stage of market adoption, we experienced strong growth in fiscal year 2016 due to the launch of new models from an existing customer and initial adoption by new customers. In the automotive aftermarket, which is dominated by demand from Asia, revenues grew as customer demand for more feature-rich products increased which is well suited to our product offerings. Although the revenue in the wearable sports camera market increased in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015, we saw a decline in this market in the second half of fiscal year 2016 as a result of high inventory levels at a major end customer. In addition, we anticipate that these high inventory levels at our customer in the wearable sports camera market will significantly and adversely impact our revenues in fiscal year 2017, particularly the first half of the fiscal year. For the twelve months ended January 31, 2016, the increases in the camera market was partially offset by a year-over-year decline in the infrastructure market resulting from continued weak market conditions in the United States and Europe as system manufacturers continue to delay investment in network upgrades to the new H.265 compression technology. \n \u00b7 We recorded operating income of $84.7 million, an increase of 63.3% as compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to continuing growth in revenues, as well as efficient control of product costs and operating expenses. \n \u00b7 We generated cash flows from operating activities of $123.6 million in fiscal year 2016, as compared to $52.3 million in fiscal year 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased net income as adjusted for increased non-cash stock-based compensation. The increase also was attributable to decreased accounts receivable associated with the timing of payments from customers, decreased inventory purchase associated with a decrease in near term revenue forecasts, increased deferred revenue associated with the timing of inventory shipments by our logistics providers and increased long-term liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The increase was partially offset by decreased liabilities associated with the timing of payments to suppliers as well as income tax payables. \n \u00b7 On June 25, 2015, we completed the acquisition of VisLab S.r.l., a privately-held Italian company that develops computer vision and intelligent control systems for automotive and other commercial applications, including Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and several generations of autonomous vehicle driving systems, for $30.0 million in cash. Of this total purchase price, $4.1 million was attributed to intangible assets, $25.3 million was attributed to goodwill, and $0.6 million was attributed to net assets acquired. \nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nDesign Wins. We closely monitor design wins by customer and end market. We consider design wins to be critical to our future success, although a design win may not successfully materialize into revenue, and even if they result in revenue, the amount generated by each design win can vary significantly. Our long-term sales expectations are based on forecasts from customers and internal estimations of customer demand factoring in the expected time to market for end customer products incorporating our solutions and associated revenue potential. Our ability to accurately forecast demand, however, can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including inaccurate forecasting by our customers, miscalculations by our customers of their inventory requirements, changes in market conditions, adverse changes in our product order mix and fluctuating demand for our customers' products.\nPricing, Product Cost and Margin. Our pricing and margins depend on the volumes and the features of the solutions we provide to our customers. Additionally, we make significant investments in new solutions for both cost improvements and new features that we expect to drive revenue and maintain margins. In general, solutions incorporated into more complex configurations, such as those used in high-performance camera or infrastructure applications, have higher prices and higher gross margins as compared to solutions sold into lower performing, more competitive camera applications. Our average selling price, or ASP, can vary by market and application due to market-specific supply and demand, the maturation of products launched in previous years and the launch of new products.\nWe continually monitor the cost of our solutions. As we rely on third-party manufacturers for the production of our products, we maintain a close relationship with these suppliers to continually monitor production yields, component costs and design efficiencies.\nShifting Consumer Preferences. Our revenue is subject to consumer preferences, regarding form factor and functionality, and how those preferences impact the video and image capture electronics that we support. For example, improved smartphone video capture capabilities, and the rapid adoption by consumers, led to the decline of pocket video cameras aimed at the video and image capture market. The current video and image capture market is now characterized by a greater volume of more specialized video and image capture devices that are less likely to be replaced with smartphones, such as wearable, including sports, IP security, UAV and automotive aftermarket cameras. This increasing specialization of video capture devices has changed our customer base and end markets and has impacted our revenue. In the future, we expect further changes in the market to continue to impact our business performance.\nContinued Concentration of Revenue by End Market. Historically, our revenue has been significantly concentrated in a small number of end markets. In fiscal year 2010, the majority of our revenue came from the pocket video, camcorder and infrastructure markets. Since that time, we have developed technologies to provide solutions for new markets such as the wearable, including sports, IP security, UAV and automotive aftermarket camera markets. We believe these new markets can continue to facilitate revenue growth and customer diversification. Since fiscal year 2013, the wearable sports and IP security markets have been our largest end markets and sales into these markets collectively generated the majority of our revenue. While we will continue to expand our end market exposure, such as to non-sports wearable cameras and UAVs, we anticipate that sales to a limited number of end markets will continue to account for a significant percentage of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. Our end market concentration may cause our financial performance to fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the success or failure of products that our SoCs are designed into as well as the overall growth or decline in the video capture markets in which we compete. In addition, we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of ODMs who build products on behalf of a limited number of OEMs and from a limited number of OEMs to whom we ship directly. We believe that our operating results for the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers.\nAbility to Capitalize on Connectivity Trend. Mobile connected devices are ubiquitous today and play an increasingly prominent role in consumers' lives. The constant connectivity provided by these devices has created a demand for connected electronic peripherals such as video and image capture devices. Our ability to capitalize on these trends by supporting our end customers in the development of connected peripherals that seamlessly cooperate with other connected devices and allow consumers to distribute and share video and images with online media platforms is critical for our success. We have added wireless communication functionality into our solutions for wearable, including sports, IP security, UAV and automotive aftermarket cameras. The combination of our compression technology with wireless connectivity enables wireless video streaming and uploading of videos and images to the Internet. Our solutions enable IP security camera systems to stream video content to either cloud infrastructure or connected mobile devices, and our solutions for wearable, including sports, and UAV cameras allow consumers to quickly stream or upload video and images to social media platforms.\nSales Volume. A typical camera design win that successfully launches into the marketplace can generate a wide range of sales volumes for our solutions, depending on the end market demand for our customers' products. This can depend on several factors, including the reputation of the end customer, market penetration, product capabilities, size of the end market that the product addresses and our end customers' ability to sell their products. In certain cases, we may provide volume discounts on sales of our solutions, which may be offset by lower manufacturing costs related to higher volumes. In general, our customers with greater market penetration and better branding tend to develop products that generate larger volumes over the product life cycle.\nCustomer Product Life Cycle. We estimate our customers' product life cycles based on the customer, type of product and end market. In general, products launched in the camera market have shorter life cycles than those sold into the infrastructure market. We typically commence commercial shipments from six to 18 months following a design win; however, in some markets, more lengthy product and development cycles are possible, depending on the scope and nature of the project. A portable consumer device typically has a product life cycle of six to 18 months. In the infrastructure market, the product life cycle can range from 24 to 60 months.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our historical operating results for the periods

</tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of HD video and image processing SoC solutions to OEMs and ODMs, either directly or through our logistics providers. Our SoC solutions have been used in the camera and infrastructure markets, although we expect the primary market for our solutions for the foreseeable future will be in the camera market as the infrastructure market continues to decline due to delays in investments in network upgrades. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales made indirectly through our logistics provider, Wintech Microelectronics Co., Ltd., or Wintech, and directly to one large ODM customer, Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd., or Chicony.\nWe typically experience seasonal fluctuations in our quarterly revenue with our third fiscal quarter normally being the highest revenue quarter. This fluctuation has been driven primarily by increased sales in the camera market as our customers build inventories in preparation for the holiday shopping season. More generally, our average selling prices fluctuate based on the mix of our solutions sold in a period which reflects the impact of both changes in unit sales of existing solutions as well as the introduction and sales of new solutions. Our solutions are typically characterized by a life cycle that begins with higher average selling prices and lower volumes, followed by broader market adoption, higher volumes and average selling prices that are lower than initial levels.\nThe end markets into which we sell our products have seen significant changes as consumer preferences have evolved in response to new technologies. As a result, the composition of our revenue may differ meaningfully during periods of technology or consumer preference changes. We expect shifts in consumer use of video capture to continue to change over time, as more specialized use cases emerge and video capture continues to proliferate.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nCost of revenue includes the cost of materials such as wafers processed by third-party foundries, costs associated with packaging, assembly and test, and our manufacturing support operations such as logistics, planning and quality assurance. Cost of revenue also includes indirect costs such as warranty, inventory valuation reserves and other general overhead costs.\nWe expect that our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as a result of changes in average selling price, product mix and the introduction of new products by us or our competitors. In general, solutions incorporated into more complex configurations, such as those used in high-performance cameras or infrastructure applications, have higher prices and higher gross margins, as compared to solutions sold into the lower performance, more competitive camera applications. As semiconductor products mature and unit volumes sold to customers increase, their average selling prices typically decline. These declines may be paired with improvements in manufacturing yields and lower wafer, packaging and test costs, which offset some of the margin reduction that could result from lower selling prices. We believe that our gross margin will decline in the future as we continue to penetrate the highly competitive camera market.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation and employee benefits. The expense also includes costs of development incurred in connection with our collaborations with our foundry vendors, costs of licensing intellectual property from third parties for product development, costs of development for software and hardware tools, cost of fabrication of mask sets for prototype products, and allocated depreciation and facility expenses. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to enhance and expand our product features and offerings.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation and employee benefits for our sales, marketing, finance, human resources, information technology and administrative personnel. The expense also includes professional service costs related to accounting, tax, legal services, and allocated depreciation and facility expenses. We expect our selling expense to increase in absolute dollars as we expand the size of our sales and marketing organization to support our anticipated growth. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue as we continue to maintain the infrastructure necessary to operate as a public company, which includes increased audit and legal fees, costs to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market, investor relations costs, and higher insurance premiums.\nOther Income (Loss), Net\nOther income (loss), net consists primarily of investment interest income and gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and remeasurements.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are incorporated in the Cayman Islands and conduct business in several countries such as the United States, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Italy and Japan, and we are subject to taxation in those jurisdictions. As such, our worldwide operating income is subject to varying tax rates and our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses and the tax laws and regulations in each geographical region. Consequently, we have experienced lower effective tax rates as a substantial percentage of our operations are conducted in lower-tax jurisdictions. If our operational structure was to change in such a manner that would increase the amount of operating income subject to taxation in higher-tax jurisdictions, or if we were to commence operations in jurisdictions assessing relatively higher tax rates, our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and/or be adversely affected.\nComparison of the Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 316,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 218,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 157,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue increased for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to strong demand for our A9, A7L, S2L and A12 SoCs in the IP security, UAV, automotive aftermarket and wearable sports camera markets. The strong growth in the IP security camera markets reflected a broader adoption of our S2L SoC by current customers in the professional security market as well as the addition of new customers in the home security and monitoring market. Despite the strong revenue growth in the IP security camera market, we experienced some softness in the China region in the second half of fiscal year 2016, which partially offset stronger results in other geographic regions in the period. Although UAVs are in the early stage of market adoption, we experienced strong growth in fiscal year 2016 due to the launch of new models from an existing customer and initial adoption by new customers. In the automotive aftermarket, which is dominated by demand from Asia, revenues grew as customer demand for more feature-rich products increased which is well suited to our product offerings. Although the revenue in the wearable sports camera market increased in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015, we saw a decline in this market in the second half of fiscal year 2016 as a result of high inventory levels at a major end customer. In addition, we anticipate that these high inventory levels at our customer in the wearable sports camera market will significantly and adversely impact our revenues in fiscal year 2017, particularly the first half of the fiscal year.\nFor the twelve months ended January 31, 2016, the increases in the camera markets were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in the infrastructure market resulting from continued weak market conditions in the United States and Europe, as system manufacturers continue to delay investment in network upgrades to the new H.265 compression technology. Infrastructure revenue declined as a percentage of total revenue from 6.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2015 to 3.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2016. We anticipate that infrastructure revenue will continue to decline as a percentage of our total revenue for the foreseeable future.\nRevenue increased for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014 primarily due to strong demand for our A5S, A7L and A9 SoCs in the IP security, wearable sports and automotive aftermarket camera markets. In addition, the initial ramp of our A5S and A9 chips into the UAV market also contributed to the revenue growth in fiscal year 2015. The increase was partially offset by a year over year decline in the infrastructure market as a result of continued weak market conditions in the United States and Europe, as system manufacturers have delayed investment in network upgrades to the new H.265 compression technology. Infrastructure revenue declined as a percentage of total revenue from 12.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2014 to 6.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2015.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 111,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 79,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 205,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 139,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue increased for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to increases in the number of SoCs sold into the camera market. The increases were partially offset by cost reductions received from suppliers for certain SoCs due to increased purchase volumes.\nGross margin increased for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to a higher percentage of revenues associated with shipments of our higher gross margin A9 and A7L chips into the wearable sports, UAV and automotive camera markets. The increases were partially offset by continuing revenue declines in the higher gross margin infrastructure business, and for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, the introduction of the lower margin S2L SoC into the price competitive Asia IP security camera market. We anticipate that gross margin will decrease over the next twelve months as revenues from the Asia IP security camera market and the consumer IP security market grow as a percentage of our total revenue. Infrastructure revenue declined as a percentage of total revenue from 12.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2014 to 6.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2015, and declined as a percentage of total revenue to 3.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2016.\nResearch and Development\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 82,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expense increased for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in engineering headcount, product development costs and facility allocation costs. Our research and development engineering headcount increased to 460 at January 31, 2016 compared to 365 at January 31, 2015, including 33 employees hired as a result of the VisLab acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. The increased engineering headcount resulted in an increase in salary related expenses of approximately $7.8 million in fiscal year 2016. The increases were also attributable to additional stock-based compensation of approximately $10.4 million in fiscal year 2016, as a result of the issuance of options and restricted stock units for newly hired employees, our annual evergreen stock program for existing employees and the increase in the stock price of our ordinary shares in the first half of fiscal year 2016. The product development costs expended on our next generation SoCs increased by approximately $8.0 million in fiscal year 2016. The increased product development costs were partially offset by $2.5 million in payments from customers who agreed to share development costs for the twelve months ended January 31, 2016. The increased engineering headcount also resulted in additional facility allocation costs of approximately $1.4 million for the twelve months ended January 31, 2016.\nResearch and development expense increased for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in engineering headcount, product development costs and facility allocation costs.

The increases were also attributable to additional stock-based compensation of approximately $3.6 million in fiscal year 2015, as a result of the issuance of options and restricted stock units for newly hired employees, our annual evergreen stock program for existing employees and the employee stock purchase plan. The product development costs expended on the development of our next generation SoCs increased by approximately $1.9 million in fiscal year 2015. The increased development costs were partially offset by a $0.9 million in payment from one customer who agreed to share development costs. In fiscal year 2014, we entered into a lease agreement for our new headquarters located in Santa Clara, California, and in fiscal year 2015, we continued the expansion of our enterprise resource planning system, resulting in additional facility allocation costs of approximately $1.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in headcount and outside professional services. Our selling, general and administrative headcount increased to 163 at January 31, 2016 compared to 144 at January 31, 2015, resulting in an increase in salary related expenses of approximately $2.9 million in fiscal year 2016. The increases were also attributable to additional stock-based compensation of approximately $4.7 million in fiscal year 2016, as a result of the issuance of options, restricted stock and restricted stock units for newly hired employees, our annual evergreen stock program for existing employees and the increase in the stock price of our ordinary shares in the first half of fiscal year 2016. In addition, we incurred approximately $0.8 million of additional expenditures on outside professional services for the twelve months ended January 31, 2016 to support the VisLab acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014 primarily due to an additional $5.7 million in compensation as a result of increases in headcount and stock-based compensation from issuance of options and restricted stock units for newly hired employees, our annual evergreen stock program for existing employees and the employee stock purchase plan. In addition, we incurred approximately $0.7 million of additional expenditures on outside professional services to support the continued development of our enterprise resource planning system, to meet the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the compliance requirements of being a public company for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015.\nOther Income (Loss), Net\nTable 154: <table> <tr>

activities increased primarily due to increased net income as adjusted for increased non-cash stock-based compensation. The increase was also attributable to decreased accounts receivable associated with the timing of payments from customers, decreased inventory purchases associated with a decrease in our near term revenue forecasts, increased deferred revenue associated with the timing of inventory shipments by our logistics providers and increased long-term liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The increase was partially offset by decreased liabilities associated with the timing of payments to suppliers as well as income tax payables.\nFiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014: Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to increased net income, adjusted for increased non-cash stock-based compensation, and increased liabilities associated with the timing of payments to suppliers as well as income tax payables. The increase was partially offset by increased accounts receivable associated with higher revenues and the timing of payments from customers, increased inventory purchases to support continuing growth of sales, increased deferred tax assets as a result of higher stock-based compensation, as well as decreased deferred revenue from the timing of shipments to our logistics provider and resulting sell-through revenue recognition.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nFiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015: Net cash used in investing activities decreased primarily due to the receipt of approximately $28.6 million in cash from selling and maturities of debt securities and approximately $7.0 million less of debt securities purchased during the period. The decrease was partially offset by the payment of $30.0 million for the acquisition of VisLab in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016.\nFiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014: Net cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to $40.0 million investments in highly liquid, short-term marketable securities, net of cash receipts from the sale or maturity of a portion of these investments.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nFiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015: Net cash provided by financing activities decreased primarily due to approximately $2.4 million of decreased option exercises and approximately $3.3 million less of excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation.\nFiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014: Net cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to an additional $2.1 million in cash proceeds from option exercises and contributions from participants in the employee stock purchase plan and an additional $2.4 million of recognized excess tax benefits from increased stock-based compensation.\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of January 31, 2016 and 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $307.9 million and $208.0 million, respectively. In fiscal year 2015, we invested $40.0 million in highly liquid, short-term marketable securities. We hold these investments as available-for-sale securities and mark them to market. As of January 31, 2016, these securities had a fair value of approximately $40.4 million with insignificant unrealized losses caused by fluctuations in market value and interest rates.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe have generated net income in each quarter beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, and we have generated cash from operations in each of fiscal years 2009 to 2016. We believe that our anticipated cash generated from operations and our existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. In the future, we expect our operating and capital expenditures to increase as we increase headcount, expand our business activities, and implement and enhance our information technology platforms. We expect our accounts receivable and inventory balances to increase, and could be partially offset by increases in accounts payable, which will result in a greater need for working capital. If our available cash balances are insufficient to satisfy our future liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell equity or convertible debt securities or borrow funds commercially. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our shareholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our ordinary shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities, these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. We may require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. Additional capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all.\nOur short- term and long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the following:\n \u00b7 our ability to generate cash from operations; \n \u00b7 our ability to control our costs; \n \u00b7 the emergence of competing or complementary technologies or products; \n \u00b7 the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, or participating in litigation-related activities; and \n \u00b7 our acquisition of complementary businesses, products and technologies. \nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of January 31, 2016:\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payment Due by Period as of January 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> All\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facilities under operating leases (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology license or other obligations under\noperating leases (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrecognized tax benefits, including interest (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) Facilities under operating leases represent facilities with initial lease terms in excess of one year. They are located in Santa Clara (California), China, Hong Kong, and Japan. The lease for our Santa Clara headquarters has a seven-year term and terminates in fiscal year 2021. The lease for our Shanghai facility has a seven-year term and terminates in fiscal year 2018. The lease for our Shenzhen facility has a three-year term and terminates in fiscal year 2019. The Hong Kong facility has a three-year term and terminates in fiscal year 2017. The leases for our Japan facilities have two-year terms and terminate in fiscal year 2017 and 2018, respectively. \n (2) Technology license obligations under operating leases represent future cash payments for software or other technology licenses which are used in product design or daily operation. \n (3) Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchase obligations with our independent contract manufacturers. \n (4) Unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, represent our liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of January 31, 2016. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. \nStock Options and Restricted Stock Units\nGrants of stock-based awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain employees to align their interests with the interests of existing shareholders. We recognize that these stock-based awards dilute existing shareholders and have sought to limit the number of shares granted while providing competitive compensation packages. As of January 31, 2016, a total of 4.0 million outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units, will potentially dilute our earnings per share. This potential dilution will only result if outstanding options vest and are exercised and restricted stock and restricted stock units vest and are settled. As of January 31, 2016, 90% of our outstanding options had exercise prices less than the then market price of our ordinary shares.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of January 31, 2016, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report, for a full description of recent accounting standards, including the respective dates of adoption and effects on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Management Estimates\nThe preparation of audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to (i) the collectibility of accounts receivable; (ii) write down of excess and obsolete inventories; (iii) intangible assets and goodwill; (iv) the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets; (v) impairment of long-lived assets and financial instruments; (vi) warranty obligations; (vii) the valuation of stock-based compensation awards and financial instruments; (viii) the probability of performance objectives achievement; (ix) the realization of tax assets and estimates of tax liabilities, including reserves for uncertain tax positions; and (x) the recognition and disclosure of contingent liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We may engage third-party valuation specialists to assist with estimates related to the valuation of financial instruments and assets associated with various contractual arrangements. Such estimates often require the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and significant judgment. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or circumstances and such differences could be material.\nWe believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgment and estimates:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from the sales of our SoCs to OEMs or ODMs, either directly or through logistics providers. Revenue from sales directly to OEMs and ODMs is recognized upon shipment provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, legal title to the products and risk of ownership have transferred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. We provide our logistics providers with the rights to return excess levels of inventory and to future price adjustments. Given the inability to reasonably estimate these price changes and returns, revenue and costs related to shipments to logistics providers are deferred until we receive notification from our logistics providers that they have sold our products. Information reported by our logistics providers includes product resale price, quantity and end customer shipment information as well as remaining inventory on hand. At the time of shipment to a logistics provider, we record a trade receivable as there is a legally enforceable right to receive payment, reduce inventory for the value of goods shipped as legal title has passed to the logistics provider and defer the related margin as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Any price adjustments are recorded as a change to deferred revenue at the time the adjustments are agreed upon.\nArrangements with certain OEM customers provide for pricing that is dependent upon the end products into which our SoCs are used. These arrangements may also entitle us to a share of the product margin ultimately realized by the OEM. The minimum guaranteed amount of revenue related to the sale of products subject to these arrangements is recognized when all other elements of revenue recognition are met. Any amounts at the date of shipment invoiced in excess of the minimum guaranteed contract price are deferred until the additional amounts we are entitled to are fixed or determinable. Additional amounts earned by us resulting from margin sharing arrangements and determination of the end products into which the products are ultimately incorporated are recognized when end customer sales volume is reported to us.\nWe also enter into engineering service agreements with certain customers. These agreements may include multiple deliverables, such as software development services, licensing of intellectual property and post-contract customer support, or PCS. We do not sell separately any of these components and do not have Vendor Specific Objective Evidence, or VSOE, for the deliverables. Accordingly, revenues from these agreements are deferred for any amounts billed until delivery of all the elements. If the agreements include PCS, the revenues are recognized ratably over the estimated supporting periods. The revenue from engineering service agreements was not material for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments that are highly liquid with original maturities at the time of purchase greater than three months are considered as marketable securities.\nWe classify these investments as available-for-sale\u201d securities carried at fair value, based on quoted market prices of similar assets, with the unrealized gains or losses reported, net of tax, as a separate component of shareholders' equity and included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets. The amortization of security premiums and accretion of discounts and the realized gains and losses are both recorded in other income (loss), net in the consolidated statements of operations. We review our investments for possible other-than-temporary impairments on a regular basis. If any loss on investment is believed to be other-than-temporary, a charge will be recorded and a new cost basis in the investment will be established. In evaluating whether a loss on a security is other-than-temporary, we consider the following factors: 1) general market conditions, 2) the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, 3) our intent and ability to hold the investment.\nFor securities in an unrealized loss position which is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the difference between the security's then-current amortized cost basis and fair value is separated into (i) the amount of the impairment related to the credit loss (i.e., the credit loss component) and (ii) the amount of the impairment related to all other factors (i.e., the non-credit loss component). The credit loss component is recognized in earnings. The non-credit loss component is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Due to the relative short term nature of the investments, there have been no other-than-temporary impairments recorded to date.\nInventory Valuation\nWe record inventories at the lower of cost or market. The cost includes materials and other production costs and is computed using standard cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory reserves are recorded for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based on forecast of future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected, or if future demand for the Company's products decreases, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Once inventory is written down, a new accounting cost basis is established and, accordingly, any associated reserve is not reversed until the inventory is sold or scrapped. There have been no material inventory losses recognized to date.\nBusiness Combinations and Intangible Assets\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets, our management makes significant estimates and assumptions.\nCritical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, replacement cost. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nGoodwill and In-Process Research and Development\nGoodwill and in-process research and development (IPR&D) are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. We have a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment test purposes based on our business and reporting structure.\nWe do not amortize goodwill. Acquired in process research and development, or IPR&D, is capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset and amortization commences upon completion of the underlying projects. When a project underlying reported IPR&D is completed, the corresponding amount of IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock-based compensation for equity awards granted to employees and directors based on the estimated fair value on the grant date, and recognize that compensation as expense using the straight-line attribution method for service condition awards or using the graded-vesting attribution method for awards with performance conditions over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period of each award. We determine the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units based on the fair market value of our ordinary shares on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. Determining the fair value of stock options on the grant date requires the input of various assumptions, including stock price of the underlying ordinary share, the exercise price of the stock option, expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend rate. The expected term is calculated using the simplified method as prescribed in the guidance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as neither relevant historical experience nor other relevant data are available to estimate future exercise behavior. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatilities of similar companies whose share prices are publicly available for a period commensurate with the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the average U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates during the respective periods commensurate with the expected term. The expected dividend yield is zero because we have not historically paid dividends and have no present intention to pay dividends. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting award forfeitures and record stock-based compensation only for those awards that are expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimates.\nWe recognize non-employee stock-based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the equity instrument. The fair value of the non-employee awards is remeasured at each reporting period until services required under the arrangement are completed, which is the vesting date.\nNet Income Per Ordinary Share\nWe apply the two-class method to calculate and present net income per ordinary share. Under the two-class method, net income is allocated between ordinary shares and other participating securities based on their participating rights. Participating securities are defined as securities that may participate in undistributed earnings with ordinary shares, whether that participation is conditioned upon the occurrence of a specified event or not. Basic net income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income allocable to ordinary shares by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income allocable to ordinary shares and income allocable to participating securities, to the extent they are dilutive, by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding, including the dilutive effects of participating securities on an if-converted basis plus the dilutive effects of ordinary shares. Our potential dilutive ordinary share equivalents consist of incremental ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of options, upon the issuance of shares pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and upon release of vested restricted stock and restricted stock units.\nWe perform an assessment as to whether instruments granted in stock-based payment transactions are participating securities. Stock-based payment awards that have not yet vested meet the definition of a participating security provided the right to receive the dividend is non-forfeitable and non-contingent. These participating securities should be included in the computation of basic net income per ordinary share under the two-class method. We have concluded that our non-vested early-exercised options meet the definition of a participating security and should be included in the computation of basic net income per ordinary share.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nWe apply authoritative guidance for the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The guidance requires that tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. Upon estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, we consider and evaluate numerous factors, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not reflect the final tax liabilities. We adjust our financial statements to reflect only those tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained under examination.\nAs part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate actual current tax exposure together"}
