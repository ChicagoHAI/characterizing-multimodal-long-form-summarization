MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this report entitled Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Certain risk factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the sections in this report entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOccupancy percentages included in the following discussion, for some of our properties, are calculated based on factors in addition to contractually leased square feet, including available power, required support space and common area.\nOverview\nOur Company. Digital Realty Trust, Inc. completed its initial public offering of common stock, or our IPO, on November 3, 2004. We believe that we have operated in a manner that has enabled us to qualify, and have elected to be treated, as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. Our Company was formed on March 9, 2004. During the period from our formation until we commenced operations in connection with the completion of our IPO, we did not have any corporate activity other than the issuance of shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock in connection with the initial capitalization of the Company. Our Operating Partnership was formed on July 21, 2004.\nBusiness and strategy. Our primary business objectives are to maximize: (i) sustainable long-term growth in earnings and funds from operations per share and unit, (ii) cash flow and returns to our stockholders and our Operating Partnership's unitholders through the payment of distributions and (iii) return on invested capital. We expect to achieve our objectives by focusing on our core business of investing in and developing data centers. A significant component of our current and future internal growth is anticipated through the development of our existing space held for development, acquisition of land for future development and acquisition of new properties. We target high quality, strategically located properties containing the physical and connectivity infrastructure that supports the applications and operations of data center and technology industry tenants and properties that may be developed for such use. Most of our data center properties contain fully redundant electrical supply systems, multiple power feeds, above-standard cooling systems, raised floor areas, extensive in-building communications cabling and high-level security systems. We focus exclusively on owning, acquiring, developing and operating data centers because we believe that the growth in data center demand and the technology-related real estate industry generally will continue to outpace the overall economy.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we owned an aggregate of 145 operating properties, including 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, with approximately 26.1 million rentable square feet including approximately 2.0 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.1 million square feet of space held for future development. The 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures have an aggregate of approximately 1.9 million rentable square feet. The 14 parcels of developable land we own comprised approximately 414 acres. At December 31, 2016, approximately 2.0 million square feet was under construction for Turn-Key Flex\u00ae, colocation and Powered Base Building\u00ae products, all of which are expected to be income producing on or after completion, in six U.S. domestic metropolitan areas, three European metropolitan areas, one Canadian metropolitan area and one Asian metropolitan area, consisting of approximately 1.2 million square feet of base building construction and 0.8 million square feet of data center construction.\nWe have developed detailed, standardized procedures for evaluating new real estate investments to ensure that they meet our financial, technical and other criteria. We expect to continue to acquire additional assets as a part of our growth strategy. We intend to aggressively manage and lease our assets to increase their cash flow. We may continue to build out our development portfolio when justified by anticipated returns.\nWe may acquire properties subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or we may incur new indebtedness in connection with acquiring or refinancing these properties. Debt service on such indebtedness will have a priority over any cash dividends with respect to Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s common stock and preferred stock. We currently intend to limit our indebtedness to 60% of our total enterprise value and, based on the closing price of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock on December 31, 2016 of $98.26, our ratio of debt to total enterprise value was approximately 26%. Our total enterprise value is defined as the sum of the market value of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s outstanding common stock (which may decrease, thereby increasing our debt to total enterprise value ratio), excluding options issued under our Amended and Restated 2004 Incentive Award Plan, plus the liquidation value of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s preferred stock, plus the aggregate value of\nour Operating Partnership's units not held by Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (with the per unit value equal to the market value of one share of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock and excluding long-term incentive units, Class C units and Class D units), plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness.\nRevenue base. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 145 operating properties through our Operating Partnership, including 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and developable land. These properties are mainly located throughout North America, with 32 properties located in Europe, four properties in Asia and three properties in Australia. We, through our predecessor, acquired our first portfolio property in January 2002 and have added properties through acquisition and development activities as follows:\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31:\n</td> <td>Operating Properties\nAcquired (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Rentable\nSquare Feet(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Square Feet of Space Under Active Development as of December 31, 2016 (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Square Feet of Space Held for Future Development as of December 31, 2016 (4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2002\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,065,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2003\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>821,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2004\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5)\n</td> <td>2,375,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2005\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5)\n</td> <td>2,777,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2006\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,509,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2007\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6)\n</td> <td>1,378,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2008\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>481,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2009\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7)(9)(10)\n</td> <td>1,894,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>321,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2010\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,562,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2011\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8)\n</td> <td>1,887,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>319,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2012\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,814,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,141,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>329,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11)\n</td> <td>929,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>276,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12)\n</td> <td>373,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>514,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating properties owned as of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,010,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,020,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,081,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Excludes properties sold: 114 Rue Ambroise Croizat (August 2016), 210 N.

Due to the capital-intensive and long-term nature of the operations being supported, our lease terms are generally longer than standard commercial leases. As of December 31, 2016, our average remaining lease term is approximately five years. Our scheduled lease expirations through December 31, 2018 are 16.4% of rentable square feet excluding month-to-month leases, space under active development and space held for future development as of December 31, 2016.\nOn January 21, 2016, the Operating Partnership sold the 47700 Kato Road and 1055 Page Avenue property, two adjacent non-data center properties totaling 199,000 square feet in Fremont, California for $37.5 million. The sale generated net proceeds of $35.8 million and we recognized a gain on the sale of approximately $1.0 million. The properties were identified as held for sale as of December 31, 2015.\nThe Company granted Equinix an option to acquire the Company's facility in 114 rue Ambroise Croizat in Paris. Equinix elected to exercise its option to acquire the Paris property, and on July 2, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the property to Equinix for approximately \u20ac190 million (or approximately $212 million based on the exchange rate as of August 1, 2016). The Paris property sale closed on August 1, 2016. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of approximately $144.3 million in the third quarter of 2016. This property was classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2016.\nOn July 11, 2016, the Company closed on the sale of a four-property data center portfolio, including two in St. Louis and two in Northern Virginia totaling over 454,000 square feet for approximately $114.5 million. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of approximately $24.5 million in the third quarter of 2016. The four properties were classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2016.\nNone of the Company's property sales to date represented a significant component or significant shift in strategy that would require discontinued operations presentation.\nFactors Which May Influence Future Results of Operations\nGlobal market and economic conditions. General economic conditions and the cost and availability of capital may be adversely affected in some or all of the metropolitan areas in which we own properties and conduct our operations. In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum. The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the United Kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process. Nevertheless, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and has given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal. Instability in the U.S., European, Asia Pacific and other international financial markets and economies may adversely affect our ability, and the ability of our tenants, to replace or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis, access the capital markets to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements and may result in adverse effects on our, and our tenants', financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our access to funds under our global revolving credit facility depends on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to us. We cannot assure you that long-term disruptions in the global economy and the return of tighter credit conditions among, and potential failures or nationalizations of, third party financial institutions as a result of such disruptions will not have an adverse effect on our lenders. If our lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to us, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not have sufficient cash flow to continue operating our business and are unable to borrow additional funds, access our existing lines of credit or raise equity or debt capital, we may need to source alternative ways to increase our liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation, curtailing development activity, disposing of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms or entering into or renewing leases on less favorable terms than we otherwise would.\nForeign currency exchange risk. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had foreign operations in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, The Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Japan and Hong Kong, and, as such, are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements of foreign currencies, which may affect future costs and cash flows. Our foreign operations are conducted in the British pound sterling, Euro, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar, Japanese Yen and the Hong Kong dollar. Our primary currency exposures are to the British pound sterling, the Euro and the Singapore dollar. The possible exit of the United Kingdom (or any other country) from the European Union or prolonged periods of uncertainty relating to any of these possibilities, could result in increased foreign currency exchange volatility. We attempt to mitigate a portion of the risk of currency fluctuation by financing our investments in the local currency denominations, although there can be no assurance that this will be effective. As a result, changes in the relation of any such foreign currency to U.S. dollars may affect our revenues, operating margins and distributions and may also affect the book value of our assets and the amount of stockholders' equity.\nRental income. The amount of rental income generated by the properties in our portfolio depends on several factors, including our ability to maintain or improve the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space available from lease terminations. Excluding approximately 2.0 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.1 million square feet of space held for future development as of December 31, 2016, the occupancy rate of the properties in our portfolio, including the 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 89.4% of our net rentable square feet.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had over 2,200 tenants in our portfolio, including the 12 properties held in our managed portfolio of unconsolidated joint ventures. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 91% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained base rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 2% to 4%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other similar inflation related index. We cannot assure you that these escalations will cover any increases in our costs or will otherwise keep rental rates at or above market rates.\nThe amount of rental income we generate also depends on maintaining or increasing rental rates at our properties, which in turn depends on several factors, including supply and demand and market rates for data center space. Included in our approximately 21.1 million net rentable square feet, excluding space under active development and space held for future development and 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, at December 31, 2016 is approximately 0.8 million square feet of data center space with extensive installed tenant improvements available for lease. Since our IPO, we have leased over 4.5 million square feet of similar space, including Turn-Key Flex\u00ae space. Our Turn-Key Flex\u00ae product is an effective solution for tenants who prefer to utilize a partner with the expertise or capital budget to provide extensive data center infrastructure and security. Our expertise in data center construction and operations enables us to lease space to these tenants at a premium over other uses. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 2.0 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.1 million square feet of space held for future development, or approximately 12% of the total rentable space in our portfolio, including the 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Our\nability to grow earnings depends in part on our ability to develop space and lease development space at favorable rates, which we may not be able to obtain. Development space requires significant capital investment in order to develop data center facilities that are ready for use and, in addition, we may require additional time or encounter delays in securing tenants for development space. We may purchase additional vacant properties and properties with vacant development space in the future. We will require additional capital to finance our development activities, which may not be available or may not be available on terms acceptable to us, including as a result of the conditions described above under Global market and economic conditions.\u201d\nIn addition, the timing between when we sign a new lease with a tenant and when that lease commences and we begin to generate rental income may be significant and may not be easily predictable. Certain leases may provide for staggered commencement dates for additional space, the timing of which may be delayed significantly.\nEconomic downturns, including as a result of the conditions described above under Global market and economic conditions,\u201d or regional downturns affecting our metropolitan areas or downturns in the technology-related real estate industry that impair our ability to lease or renew or re-lease space, or otherwise reduce returns on our investments or the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments, as in the case of tenant bankruptcies, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties.\nScheduled lease expirations. Our ability to re-lease expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates will impact our results of operations. In addition to approximately 2.4 million square feet of available space in our portfolio, which excludes approximately 2.0 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.1 million square feet of space held for future development as of December 31, 2016 and the two properties held as investments in our non-managed unconsolidated joint ventures, leases representing approximately 6.8% and 9.6% of the net rentable square footage of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we signed new leases totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet of space and renewal leases totaling approximately 1.4 million square feet of space. The following table summarizes our leasing activity in the year ended December 31, 2016:\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

We continue to see strong demand in most of our key metropolitan areas for data center space and, subject to the supply of available data center space in these metropolitan areas, expect the rental rates we are likely to achieve on re-leased or renewed data center space leases for 2017 expirations on an average aggregate basis will generally be higher than the rates currently being paid for the same space on a GAAP basis and flat on a cash basis. For the year ended December 31, 2016, rents on renewed space increased by an average of 10.2% on a GAAP basis on our Turn-Key Flex\u00ae space compared to the expiring rents and increased by an average of 22.9% on a GAAP basis on our Powered Base Building\u00ae space compared to the expiring rents. Our past performance may not be indicative of future results, and we cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our properties will be re-leased at all or at rental rates equal to or above the current average rental rates. Further, re-leased/renewed rental rates in a particular metropolitan area may not be consistent with rental rates across our portfolio as a whole and may fluctuate from one period to another due to a number of factors, including local real estate conditions, local supply and demand for data center space, competition from other data center developers or operators, the condition of the property and whether the property, or space within the property, has been developed.\nGeographic concentration. We depend on the market for data centers in specific geographic regions and significant changes in these regional metropolitan areas can impact our future results. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio, including the 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, was geographically concentrated in the following metropolitan areas:\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metropolitan Area\n</td> <td>Percentage of December 31, 2016 total annualized rent (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New York\n</td> <td>11.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Northern Virginia\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>London, United Kingdom\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dallas\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silicon Valley\n</td> <td>8.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chicago\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Phoenix\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>San Francisco\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Singapore\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Atlanta\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seattle\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Boston\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Los Angeles\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Annualized rent is monthly contractual rent (defined as cash base rent before abatements) under existing leases as of December 31, 2016 multiplied by 12.

Our operating expenses generally consist of utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, property management fees, insurance and site maintenance costs, as well as rental expenses on our ground and building leases. In particular, our buildings require significant power to support the data center operations contained in them. Many of our leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for all or a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us. However, we generally are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses, other than utility expense, and real estate taxes under our leases for Turn-Key Flex\u00ae facilities. We also incur general and administrative expenses, including expenses relating to our asset management function, as well as significant legal, accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance, SEC reporting and compliance with the various provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct. Increases or decreases in such operating expenses will impact our overall performance. We expect to incur additional operating expenses as we continue to expand.\nClimate change legislation. In June 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives approved comprehensive clean energy and climate change legislation intended to cut greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions, via a cap-and-trade program. The U.S. Senate did not subsequently pass similar legislation. New climate change legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate in 2013, but significant opposition to federal climate change legislation exists.\nIn the absence of comprehensive federal climate change legislation, over the past several years, regulatory agencies, primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and states took the lead in regulating GHG emissions in the U.S. Under the Obama administration, EPA moved aggressively to regulate GHG emissions from automobiles and large stationary sources, including electricity producers, using its own authority under the Clean Air Act. The Trump administration has signaled that it intends to eliminate or modify certain of the EPA's GHG emissions regulations and refocus EPA's mission away from such regulation.\nThe EPA made an endangerment finding in 2009 that allows it to create regulations imposing emissions reporting, permitting, control technology installation, and monitoring requirements applicable to certain emitters of GHGs, including facilities that provide electricity to our data centers, although the materiality of the impacts will not be fully known until all regulations are finalized and legal challenges are resolved. Under the Obama administration, the EPA finalized rules imposing permitting and control technology requirements upon certain newly-constructed or modified facilities which emit GHGs under the Clean Air Act New Source Review Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or NSR PSD, and Title V permitting programs. As a result, newly-issued NSR PSD and Title V permits for new or modified electricity generating units (EGUs) and other facilities may need to address GHG emissions, including by requiring the installation of Best Available Control Technology.\u201d The EPA implemented in December 2015 the Clean Power Plan\u201d regulating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from new and existing coal-fired and natural gas EGUs. Existing EGUs are subject to statewide CO2 emissions reduction targets, an effort designed to achieve a thirty-two percent reduction in nationwide existing EGU CO2 emissions by 2030 (in comparison to 2005 levels). New, modified, and reconstructed EGUs are subject to New Source Performance Standards\u201d that include both technological requirements and numeric emission limits. However, twenty-four states and a number of industry groups challenged the Clean Power Plan in federal court, and in February 2016 the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the Clean Power Plan until the legal challenges have been decided. Further, President Trump has voiced opposition to the Clean Power Plan, and he could seek to eliminate it. Separately, the EPA's GHG reporting rule\u201d requires that certain emitters, including electricity generators, monitor and report GHG emissions. The Trump administration may seek to revise or reverse these regulations.\nAs a result, states may drive near-term regulation to reduce GHG emissions in the United States. At the state level, California implemented a GHG cap-and-trade program that began imposing compliance obligations on industrial sectors, including electricity generators and importers, in January 2013. In September 2016, California adopted legislation calling for a further reduction in GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.\nOutside the United States, the European Union, or EU (including the United Kingdom), has been operating since 2005 under a cap-and-trade program, which directly affects the largest emitters of GHGs, including electricity producers from whom we purchase power, and the EU has taken a number of other climate change-related initiatives, including a directive targeted at improving energy efficiency (which introduces energy efficiency auditing requirements). The Paris Agreement, which was adopted by the United States and 194 other countries and looks to prevent global average temperatures from increasing by more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels officially went into force on November 4, 2016. However, President Trump has signaled that he may withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. National legislation may also be implemented independently by members of the EU. For example, in the United Kingdom, the implementation of the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme introduced a mandatory reporting and pricing scheme that is designed to incentivize energy efficiency and cut emissions by large energy users. It is not yet clear how Brexit will impact the United Kingdom's (or the EU's) approach to climate change regulation. In Canada, the first compliance period under Ontario's GHG cap-and-trade program began in January 2017. Climate change regulations are in various stages of implementation in other nations as well, including nations where we operate, such as Australia, where a GHG emissions cap was implemented in 2016.\nThe cost of electric power comprises a significant component of our operating expenses. Any additional taxation or regulation of energy use, including as a result of (i) new legislation that Congress may pass, (ii) the regulations that the EPA has proposed or finalized, (iii) regulations under legislation that states have passed or may pass, or (iv) any further legislation or regulations in the EU or other regions where we operate could significantly increase our costs, and we may not be able to effectively pass all of these costs on to our tenants. These matters could adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nInterest rates. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.1 billion of variable rate debt subject to interest rate swap agreements on certain tranches of our unsecured term loan, along with $210.1 million and $364.3 million of variable rate debt that was outstanding on the 2016 global revolving credit facility and the unswapped portion of the 2016 unsecured term loan, respectively. The availability of debt and equity capital may decrease or be on unfavorable terms as a result of the circumstances described above under Global market and economic conditions\u201d or other factors. The effects on commercial real estate mortgages, if available, include, but may not be limited to: higher loan spreads, tightened loan covenants, reduced loan-to-value ratios resulting in lower borrower proceeds and higher principal payments. Potential future increases in interest rates and credit spreads may increase our interest expense and fixed charges and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, potentially impacting our future access to the debt and equity capital markets. Increased interest rates may also increase the risk that the counterparties to our swap agreements will default on their obligations, which could further increase our interest expense. If we cannot obtain capital from third party sources, we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist, satisfy our debt service obligations or pay the cash dividends to Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s stockholders necessary to maintain its qualification as a REIT.\nDemand for data center space. Our portfolio of properties consists primarily of data centers. A decrease in the demand for, or increase in supply of, data center space, Internet gateway facilities or other technology-related real estate would have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition than if we owned a portfolio with a more diversified tenant base or less specialized use. We have invested in building out additional inventory primarily in what we anticipate will be our active major metropolitan areas prior to having executed leases with respect to this space. We believe that demand in key metropolitan areas such as Northern Virginia, Dallas and Chicago is largely in line with supply. We also continue to see strong demand in other key metropolitan areas across our portfolio. However, until this inventory is leased up, which will depend on a number of factors, including available data center space in these metropolitan areas, our return on invested capital is negatively impacted. Our development activities make us particularly susceptible to general economic slowdowns, including recessions and the other circumstances described above under Global market and economic conditions,\u201d as well as adverse developments in the data center, Internet and data communications and broader technology industries. Any such slowdown or adverse development could lead to reduced corporate IT spending or reduced demand for data center space. Reduced demand could also result from business relocations, including to metropolitan areas that we do not currently serve. Changes in industry practice or in technology, such as virtualization technology, more efficient computing or networking devices, or devices that require higher power densities than today's devices, could also reduce demand for the physical data center space we provide or make the tenant improvements in our facilities obsolete or in need of significant upgrades to remain viable. In addition, the development of new technologies, the adoption of new industry standards or other factors could render many of our tenants' current products and services obsolete or unmarketable and contribute to a downturn in their businesses, thereby increasing the likelihood that they default under their leases, become insolvent or file for bankruptcy. In addition, demand for data center space in our properties, or the rates at which we lease space, may be adversely impacted either across our portfolio or in specific metropolitan areas as a result of an increase in the number of competitors, or the amount of space being offered in our metropolitan areas and other metropolitan areas by our competitors.\nTelx and European Portfolio Acquisitions. We believe that the acquisitions of Telx and the European Portfolio will provide a number of strategic and financial benefits, including providing us a leading colocation and interconnection platform, a premium connectivity infrastructure and enhanced growth potential in attractive locations. However, there can be no assurance that we will realize the intended benefits of the Telx Acquisition and the European Portfolio Acquisition and they may divert management's attention, and disrupt our plans and operations. In addition, we may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities related to Telx and the European Portfolio for which we may have no or limited recourse against the sellers.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in Item 8, Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We describe below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. Our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date on the front cover of this report.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nAcquisition of real estate. The price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors including the condition of the property and improvements, the occupancy of the building, the term and rate of in-place leases, the creditworthiness of the tenants, favorable or unfavorable financing, above- or below-market ground leases and numerous other factors.\nAccordingly, we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the identifiable assets including intangibles and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair value of such assets and liabilities. This includes determining the value of the property and improvements, land, ground leases, if any, and tenant improvements. Additionally, we evaluate the value of in-place leases on occupancy and market rent, the value of the tenant relationships, the value (or negative value) of above- (or below-) market leases, any debt or deferred taxes assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us and any building leases assumed from the seller. Each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations. For example, if we were to allocate more value to land, there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount. If we were to allocate more value to the property as opposed to allocating to the value of in-place tenant leases, this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time. This potential effect occurs because the amounts allocated to property are depreciated over the estimated lives of the property whereas amounts allocated to in-place tenant leases are amortized over the estimated term (including renewal and extension assumptions) of the leases. Additionally, the amortization of the value (or negative value) assigned to above- (or below-) market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in-place tenant leases and tenant relationships, which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated income statements.\nFrom time to time, we will receive offers for sale of our properties, either solicited or unsolicited. For those offers that are accepted, the prospective buyer will usually require a due diligence period before consummation of the transaction. It is not unusual for matters to arise that result in the withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this process. We classify real estate as held for sale\u201d when all criteria under the GAAP guidance have been met.\nCapitalization of costs. Direct and indirect project costs that are clearly associated with the development of properties are capitalized as incurred. Project costs include all costs directly associated with the development of a property, including construction costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, legal fees and costs of personnel working on the project. Indirect costs that do not clearly relate to the projects under development are not capitalized and are charged to expense as incurred.\nCapitalization of costs begins when the activities necessary to get the development project ready for its intended use begin, which include costs incurred before the beginning of construction. Capitalization of costs ceases when the development project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Determining when a development project commences and when it is substantially complete and ready for its intended use involves a degree of judgment. We generally consider a development project to be substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy. If and when development of a property is suspended pursuant to a formal change in the planned use of the property, we will evaluate whether the accumulated costs exceed the estimated value of the project and write off the amount of any such excess accumulated costs. For a development project that is suspended for reasons other than a formal change in the planned use of such property, the accumulated project costs are evaluated for impairment consistent with our impairment policies for long-lived assets. Capitalized costs are allocated to the specific components of a project that are benefited.\nUseful lives of assets. We are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate. These assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate such investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.\nAsset impairment evaluation. We review each of our properties for indicators that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of the property, a change in the expected holding period for the property, a significant adverse change in how the property is being used or expected to be used based on the underwriting at the time of acquisition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development of the property, or a history of operating or cash flow losses of the property. When such impairment indicators exist, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows (excluding interest charges) expected to result from the real estate investment's use and eventual disposition and compare that estimate to the carrying value of the property. We consider factors such as future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If our future undiscounted net cash flow evaluation indicates that we are unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. These losses have a direct impact on our net income because recording an\nimpairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether the carrying value of a property is recoverable, our strategy of holding properties over the long-term directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable and therefore requiring the recording of an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that the asset fails the recoverability test, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value.\nWe generally estimate the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues, expenses and capital improvement costs that a market participant would use based on the highest and best use of the asset, which is similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers. In certain cases, we may supplement this analysis by obtaining outside broker opinions of value.\nRevenue Recognition\nRental revenue is recognized using the straight-line method over the terms of the tenant leases. Deferred rents included in our consolidated balance sheets represent the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized to date on a straight-line basis versus the contractual rental payments under the terms of the leases. Many of our leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us. However, we generally are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses, other than utility expense, and real estate taxes under our leases for Turn-Key Flex\u00ae facilities. Such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred. Lease termination fees are recognized over the remaining term of the lease, effective as of the date the lease modification is finalized, assuming collection is not considered doubtful. As discussed above, we recognize amortization of the value of acquired above- or below-market tenant leases as a reduction of rental revenue in the case of above-market leases or an increase to rental revenue in the case of below-market leases.\nWe must make subjective estimates as to when our revenue is earned and the collectability of our accounts receivable related to minimum rent, deferred rent, expense reimbursements, lease termination fees and other income. We specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, tenant concentrations, tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts. These estimates have a direct impact on our net revenue because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net revenue, and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net revenue for a particular period.\nShare-Based Awards\nWe recognize compensation expense related to share-based awards. We generally amortize this compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. The calculation of the fair value of share-based awards is subjective and requires several assumptions over such items as expected stock volatility, dividend payments and future company results. These assumptions have a direct impact on our net income because a higher share-based awards amount would result in lower net income for a particular period.\nResults of Operations\nThe discussion below relates to our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 primarily as a result of newly vacant space at certain properties along with the British pound sterling and Euro weakening against the U.S. dollar, which was offset by new or renewed leases at certain of our properties during the year ended December 31, 2015, the largest of which were for space at 350 East Cermak Road, 4025 Midway Road and 1350 Duane Avenue.\nPre-stabilized and other revenue increases during the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily a result of the Telx Acquisition, which contributed approximately $42.2 million and $38.9 million to rental revenue and interconnection revenue, respectively, along with new leases at our properties during the year ended December 31, 2015, which were primarily leases of completed development space, the largest of which were for space at 44060 Digital Loudoun Plaza, 29A International Business Park, Principal Park, Crawley and 2121 South Price Road.\nFee Income\nOccasionally, customers engage the Company for certain services. The nature of these services historically involves property management, construction management, and assistance with financing. The proper revenue recognition of these services can be different, depending on whether the arrangements are service revenue or contractor type revenue. Service revenues are typically recognized on an equal monthly basis based on the minimum fee to be earned. The monthly amounts could be adjusted depending on if certain performance milestones are met.\nFee income also includes management fees. These fees arise from contractual agreements with entities in which we have a noncontrolling interest. The management fees are recognized as earned under the respective agreements. Management and other fee income related to partially owned entities are recognized to the extent attributable to the unaffiliated interest.\nOther\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a non-cash gain on lease termination of approximately $29.2 million, as one of our tenants, as part of a lease termination, conveyed substantially all of its colocation and turn-key improvements to the Company.\nOperating Expenses and Interest Expense\nOperating expenses and interest expense during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in

expenses decreased by approximately $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as a result of lower utility expense due to decreased usage and vacancies at certain properties and operating efficiencies realized from the Telx Acquisition.\nStabilized property taxes increased by approximately $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily as a result of an additional property tax re-assessment recorded in 2016 at four properties within the stabilized pool along with a successful appeal in 2015 for taxes at one property in Texas within the stabilized pool.\nPre-stabilized and other rental property operating and maintenance expenses increased by approximately $120.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily as a result of the Telx Acquisition and European Portfolio Acquisition, which contributed approximately $114.3 million to the increase.\nPre-stabilized and other property tax expense increased approximately $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily as a result of reassessed value increases at five properties within the pre-stabilized pool offset by the tax refund at one property in Singapore.\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

expenses decreased by approximately $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily as a result of the British pound sterling and Euro weakening against the U.S. dollar.\nStabilized property taxes decreased by approximately $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily as a result of successful appeals for taxes at two properties in Texas and one property in California within the stabilized pool during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nPre-stabilized and other rental property operating and maintenance expenses increased by approximately $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily as a result of the Telx Acquisition, which contributed approximately $25.2 million to the increase, along with development projects being placed into service leading to higher utility expense in 2015.\nPre-stabilized and other property tax expense increased approximately $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily as a result of reassessed value increases at five properties within the pre-stabilized pool.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nThe change in fair value of contingent consideration decreased approximately $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily as a result of reducing the fair value related to the Sentrum acquisition by approximately $45.9 million during 2015. The adjustment was the result of an evaluation by management that no additional leases would be executed for vacant space by July 11, 2015, the contingency expiration date.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $128.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, principally because of the Telx Acquisition and European Portfolio Acquisition, which contributed approximately $130.3 million to the increase, along with depreciation on development projects that were placed into service in late 2015 and during 2016, offset by properties sold during 2015 and 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, principally because of the Telx Acquisition, which contributed approximately $30.7 million to the increase, along with depreciation on development projects that were placed into service in late 2014 and during 2015, offset by properties sold during 2014 and 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by approximately $47.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to the Telx Acquisition and European Portfolio Acquisition along with the growth of our Company, with an increase in headcount from 2015 to 2016, resulting in additional compensation expense, along with higher professional fees and marketing expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by approximately $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the Telx Acquisition along with the growth of our Company, with\nan increase in headcount from 2014 to 2015, resulting in additional compensation expense, along with higher professional fees and marketing expenses.\nTransactions\nTransaction expenses increased by approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, principally because of transaction expenses attributable to the European Portfolio Acquisition, which was completed in July 2016, offset by expenses attributable to the Telx Acquisition, which was completed in October 2015. Transaction expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 also include integration expenses of approximately $8.9 million.\nTransaction expenses increased by approximately $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, principally because of the Telx Acquisition, which was completed in October 2015.\nOther\nOther expense increased by approximately $57.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to the write off of straight-line rent receivables related to the Telx Acquisition ($75.3 million), which was partially offset by a gain related to the settlement of pre-existing tenant relationships with Telx ($14.4 million).\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by approximately $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily as a result of the issuance of the 3.950% 2022 Notes in June 2015, the issuance of the 3.400% 2020 Notes and 4.750% 2025 Notes in October 2015 and the issuance of the 2024 Notes in April 2016, offset by lower interest expense on secured debt due to the paydown of several mortgage loans in 2015 and 2016.\nInterest expense increased by approximately $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014, primarily a result of the issuance of the 2022 Notes in June 2015, the issuance of the 2023 Notes in April 2014 and the $3.9 million of fees paid in 2015 related to an unused bridge facility, which was put in place in anticipation of the Telx Acquisition.\nImpairment of Investments in Real Estate\nWe have identified certain non-core investment properties we intend to sell as part of our capital recycling strategy. Our capital recycling program was designed to identify non-strategic and underperforming assets that can be sold to generate proceeds that will support the funding of our core investment activity. During this process, we have evaluated the carrying value of certain investment properties identified for potential sale to ensure the carrying value is recoverable in light of a potentially shorter holding period. As a result of our evaluation, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $126.5 million of impairment losses on five properties located in the Midwest, Northeast and West regions. As of December 31, 2014, these properties did not meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale. We had no impairment losses during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nGain on Sale of Properties\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a gain on sale of properties of $169.9 million primarily related to the disposition of (i) 47700 Kato Road and 1055 Page Avenue, which sold for $37.5 million in January 2016, (ii) a four-property portfolio composed of 210 N. Tucker Boulevard, 900 Walnut Street, 251 Exchange Place and 1807 Michael Faraday Court, which sold for $114.5 million in the aggregate in July 2016, and (iii) 114 Ambroise Croizat, which sold for $212.0 million in August 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a gain on sale of properties of $94.6 million related to the disposition of 100 Quannapowitt, which sold for $31.1 million in February 2015, 3300 East Birch Street, which sold for $14.2 million in March 2015, 833 Chestnut Street, which sold for $160.8 million in April 2015, and 650 Randolph Road, which sold for $9.2 million in December 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized a gain on sale of property of $15.9 million, related to the disposition of 6 Braham Street, which sold for \u00a325.0 million (or approximately $41.5 million based on the exchange rate as of April 7, 2014, the date of sale).\nGain on Contribution of Properties to Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized gains of $95.4 million related to the contribution of two properties to two unconsolidated joint ventures. We received net proceeds of approximately $178.9 million in connection with these two transactions and retained a 20% interest in each of the joint ventures. We had no transfers of properties to unconsolidated joint ventures during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of the Parent Company\nIn this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Parent Company\u201d section and in the Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership\u201d section below, the term, our Parent Company\u201d, refers to Digital Realty Trust, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding our Operating Partnership.\nAnalysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur Parent Company's business is operated primarily through our Operating Partnership of which our Parent Company is the sole general partner and which it consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Because our Parent Company operates on a consolidated basis with our Operating Partnership, the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership\u201d should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of our Parent Company on a consolidated basis and how our Company is operated as a whole.\nOur Parent Company issues public equity from time to time, but generally does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by our Operating Partnership. Our Parent Company itself does not hold any indebtedness other than guarantees of the indebtedness of our Operating Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates and an intercompany loan that was made and repaid in 2015, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of our Operating Partnership. Therefore, the consolidated assets and liabilities and the consolidated revenues and expenses of our Parent Company and our Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements, except for immaterial differences related to cash, other assets and accrued liabilities that arise from public company expenses paid by our Parent Company and an intercompany loan that was made and repaid during 2015. However, all debt, other than the intercompany loan, is held directly or indirectly at our Operating Partnership level. Our Parent Company's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common and preferred stock. Our Parent Company's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from our Operating Partnership.\nAs the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership, our Parent Company has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for our Operating Partnership's day-to-day management and control. Our Parent Company causes our Operating Partnership to distribute such portion of its available cash as our Parent Company may in its discretion determine, in the manner provided in our Operating Partnership's partnership agreement. Our Parent Company receives proceeds from its equity issuances from time to time, but is generally required by our Operating Partnership's partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to our Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units of our Operating Partnership.\nOur Parent Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with an effective shelf registration statement filed on April 20, 2015, which allows our Parent Company to register an unspecified amount of various classes of equity securities. As circumstances warrant, our Parent Company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. Any proceeds from such equity issuances would be generally contributed to our Operating Partnership in exchange for additional equity interests in our Operating Partnership. Our Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to acquire additional properties, to fund development opportunities and for general working capital purposes, including potentially for the repurchase, redemption or retirement of outstanding debt or equity securities.\nThe liquidity of our Parent Company is dependent on our Operating Partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to our Parent Company. The primary cash requirement of our Parent Company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders. Our Parent Company also guarantees our Operating Partnership's, as well as certain of its subsidiaries' and affiliates', unsecured debt. If our Operating Partnership or such subsidiaries fail to fulfill their debt requirements, which trigger Parent\nCompany guarantee obligations, then our Parent Company will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. However, our Parent Company's only material asset is its investment in our Operating Partnership.\nWe believe our Operating Partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and funds available under its 2016 global revolving credit facility are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to our Parent Company and, in turn, for our Parent Company to make its dividend payments to its stockholders. However, we cannot assure you that our Operating Partnership's sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including making distribution payments to our Parent Company. The lack of availability of capital could adversely affect our Operating Partnership's ability to pay its distributions to our Parent Company, which would in turn, adversely affect our Parent Company's ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders.\nOn June 29, 2011, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. entered into equity distribution agreements, which we refer to as the 2011 Equity Distribution Agreements, with each of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, or the Agents, under which it could issue and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $400.0 million from time to time through, at its discretion, any of the Agents as its sales agents. The sales of common stock made under the 2011 Equity Distribution Agreements will be made in at the market\u201d offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act. To date, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. has generated net proceeds of approximately $342.7 million from the issuance of approximately 5.7 million common shares under the 2011 Equity Distribution Agreements at an average price of $60.35 per share after payment of approximately $3.5 million of commissions to the sales agents and before offering expenses. No sales were made under the program during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2016, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of $53.8 million remained available for offer and sale under the program.\nFuture Uses of Cash\nOur Parent Company may from time to time seek to retire, redeem or repurchase its equity or the debt securities of our Operating Partnership through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, redemptions or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions or other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nWe are also subject to the commitments discussed below under Dividends and Distributions.\u201d\nDividends and Distributions\nOur Parent Company is required to distribute 90% of its taxable income (excluding capital gains) on an annual basis in order for it to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, our Parent Company intends to make, but is not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to its common stockholders from cash flow from our Operating Partnership's operating activities. While historically our Parent Company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its stockholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property. All such distributions are at the discretion of our Parent Company's board of directors. Our Parent Company considers market factors and our Operating Partnership's performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining distribution levels. Our Parent Company has distributed at least 100% of its taxable income annually since inception to minimize corporate level federal income taxes. Amounts accumulated for distribution to stockholders are invested primarily in interest-bearing accounts and short-term interest-bearing securities, which are consistent with our intention to maintain our Parent Company's status as a REIT.\nAs a result of this distribution requirement, our Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on-going operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not REITs can. Our Parent Company may need to continue to raise capital in the debt and equity markets to fund our Operating Partnership's working capital needs, as well as potential developments at new or existing properties, acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures. In addition, our Parent Company may be required to use borrowings under our 2016 global revolving credit facility, if necessary, to meet REIT distribution requirements and maintain our Parent Company's REIT status.\nOur Parent Company declared the following dividends on its common and preferred stock during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

In connection with the redemption, the previously incurred offering costs of approximately $10.3 million were deducted in the computation of net income available to common stockholders.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Distributions out of our Parent Company's current or accumulated earnings and profits are generally classified as ordinary income whereas distributions in excess of our Parent Company's current and accumulated earnings and profits, to the extent of a stockholder's U.S. federal income tax basis in our Parent Company's stock, are generally classified as a return of capital. Distributions in excess of a stockholder's U.S. federal income tax basis in our Parent Company's stock are generally characterized as capital gain. Cash provided by operating activities has been generally sufficient to fund distributions on an annual basis, however, we may also need to utilize borrowings under the 2016 global revolving credit facility to fund distributions.\nThe expected tax treatment of distributions on our Parent Company's common and preferred stock paid in 2016 is as follows: approximately 98% ordinary income and 2% capital gain distribution. The tax treatment of distributions on our Parent Company's common and preferred stock paid in 2015 was as follows: approximately 94% ordinary income and 6% capital gain distribution. The tax treatment of distributions on our Parent Company's common and preferred stock paid in 2014 was as follows: approximately 82% ordinary income and 18% capital gain distribution.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership\nIn this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership\u201d section, the terms we\u201d, our\u201d and us\u201d refer to our operating partnership together with its consolidated subsidiaries or our operating partnership and our Parent Company together with their consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.\nAnalysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur Parent Company is our sole general partner and consolidates our results of operations for financial reporting purposes. Because we operate on a consolidated basis with our Parent Company, the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Parent Company\u201d should be read in conjunction with this section to understand our liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $10.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, excluding $11.5 million of restricted cash. Restricted cash primarily consists of contractual capital expenditures plus other deposits.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of operating expenses, development costs and other expenditures associated with our properties, distributions to our Parent Company in order for it to make dividend payments on its preferred stock, distributions to our Parent Company in order for it to make dividend payments to its stockholders required to maintain its REIT status, distributions to the unitholders in our operating partnership, capital expenditures, debt service on our loans and, potentially, acquisitions. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations, restricted cash accounts established for certain future payments and by drawing upon our 2016 global revolving credit facility.\nOn January 15, 2016, we refinanced our global revolving credit facility and entered into a global senior credit agreement for a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which we refer to as the 2016 global revolving credit facility, that replaced the $2.0 billion revolving credit facility executed on August 15, 2013, as amended. The 2016 global revolving credit facility has an accordion feature that would enable us to increase the borrowing capacity of the credit facility to up to $2.5 billion, subject to the receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent. The refinanced facility matures on January 15, 2020, with two six-month extension options available. The interest rate for borrowings under the 2016 global revolving credit facility equals the applicable index plus a margin which is based on the credit ratings of our long-term debt and is currently 100 basis points. An annual facility fee on the total commitment amount of the facility, based on the credit ratings of our long-term debt, currently 20 basis points, is payable quarterly. Funds may be drawn in U.S., Canadian, Singapore, Australian and Hong Kong dollars, as well as Euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen. As of December 31, 2016, borrowings under the global revolving credit facility bore interest at an overall blended rate of 1.38% composed of 1.67% (U.S. dollars), 1.25% (British pound sterling), 0.63% (Euros), 1.66% (Hong Kong dollars), 0.92% (Japanese yen), 1.52% (Singapore dollar) and 1.92% (Canadian dollars). The interest rates were based on 1-month LIBOR, 1-month GBP LIBOR, 1-month EURIBOR, 1-month HIBOR, 1-month JPY LIBOR, 1-month SOR and 1-month CDOR, respectively, plus a margin of 1.00%. We have used and intend to use borrowings under the 2016 global revolving credit facility to acquire additional properties, fund development opportunities and to provide for working capital and other corporate purposes. The 2016 global revolving credit facility contains various restrictive covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make certain investments or merge with another company, and requirements to maintain financial coverage ratios, including with respect to unencumbered assets. In addition, the 2016 global revolving credit facility restricts Digital Realty Trust, Inc. from making distributions to its stockholders, or redeeming or otherwise repurchasing shares of its capital stock, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, except in limited circumstances including as necessary to enable Digital Realty Trust, Inc. to maintain its qualification as a REIT and to minimize the payment of income or excise tax. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all of such covenants. As of December 31, 2016, we have capitalized approximately $10.9 million of financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, related to the 2016 global revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $210.1 million was drawn under this facility and $20.0 million of letters of credit were issued, leaving approximately $1.8 billion available for use.\nOn January 15, 2016, we refinanced our senior unsecured multi-currency term loan facility and entered into a term loan agreement, which governs (i) a $1.25 billion 5-year senior unsecured term loan, which we refer to as the 5-Year Term Loan, and (ii) a $300 million 7-year senior unsecured term loan, which we refer to as the 7-Year Term Loan. The 2016 term loan agreement replaced the $1.0 billion term loan agreement executed on April 16, 2012, as amended. The 5-Year Term Loan matures on January 15, 2021 and the 7-Year Term Loan matures on January 15, 2023. In addition, we have the ability from time to time to increase the aggregate size of lending under the 2016 term loan agreement from $1.55 billion to up to $1.8 billion, subject to receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent. Interest rates are based on our senior unsecured debt ratings and are currently 110 basis points and 155 basis points over the applicable index for floating rate advances for the 5-Year Term Loan and the 7-Year Term Loan, respectively. Funds may be drawn in U.S., Canadian, Singapore, Australian and Hong Kong dollars, as well as Euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen. Based on exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2016, the balance outstanding is approximately $1.5 billion, excluding deferred financing costs. We have used borrowings under the term loan for acquisitions, repayment of indebtedness, development, working capital and general corporate purposes. The covenants under the term loans are consistent with our 2016 global revolving credit facility and, as of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all of such covenants. As of December 31, 2016, we have capitalized approximately $6.1 million, of financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, related to the 2016 unsecured term loans.\nFor a discussion of the potential impact of current global economic and market conditions on our liquidity and capital resources, see -Factors Which May Influence Future Results of Operations-Global market and economic conditions\u201d above.\nOur Parent Company commenced its at-the-market equity distribution program in June 2011, which is discussed under Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Parent Company\u201d above. To date, our Parent Company has generated net proceeds of approximately $342.7 million from the issuance of approximately 5.7 million shares of common stock under the program at an average price of $60.35 per share after payment of approximately $3.5 million of commissions to the sales agents before offering expenses. The proceeds from the issuances were contributed to us in exchange for the issuance of approximately 5.7 million common units to our Parent Company. No sales were made under the program during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2016, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of $53.8 million remained available for offer and sale under the program.\nOn January 21, 2016, the operating partnership closed on the sale of 47700 Kato Road and 1055 Page Avenue, two adjacent non-data center properties totaling 199,000 square feet in Fremont, California for $37.5 million. The sale generated net proceeds of $35.8 million, and we recognized a gain on the sale of approximately $1.0 million. The properties were identified as held for sale as of December 31, 2015.\nThe Parent Company granted Equinix an option to acquire our facility in 114 rue Ambroise Croizat in Paris. Equinix elected to exercise its option to acquire the Paris property, and on July 2, 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell the property to Equinix for approximately \u20ac190 million (or approximately $212 million based on the exchange rate as of August 1, 2016). The Paris property sale closed on August 1, 2016. We recognized a gain on the sale of approximately $144.3 million in the third quarter of 2016. This property was classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2016.\nOn July 11, 2016, the operating partnership closed on the sale of a four-property data center portfolio, including two in St. Louis and two in Northern Virginia, totaling over 454,000 square feet for approximately $114.5 million. We recognized a gain on the sale of approximately $24.5 million in the third quarter of 2016. The four properties were classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2016.\nNone of our property sales to date represented a significant component or significant shift in strategy that would require discontinued operations presentation.\nThe growing acceptance by private institutional investors of the data center asset class has generally pushed capitalization rates lower as such private investors typically have lower return expectations than we do. As a result, we anticipate that near-term acquisitions activity will comprise a smaller percentage of our growth until seller price expectations realign with our return requirements.\nConstruction ($

future development. Base building construction consists of ongoing improvements to building infrastructure in preparation for future data center fit-out. Datacenter construction includes 0.8 million square feet of Turn Key Flex\u00ae, colocation and Powered Base Building\u00ae products with a cost to date of approximately $309.1 million. Generally, we expect to deliver the space within 12 months; however, lease commencement dates may significantly impact final delivery schedules. Equipment pool and other inventory represent the value of long-lead time equipment and materials required for timely deployment and delivery of data center construction fit-out. Campus, tenant improvements and other costs include the value of development work which benefits space recently converted to our operating portfolio and is composed primarily of shared infrastructure projects and first-generation tenant improvements.\nFuture Uses of Cash\nOur properties require periodic investments of capital for tenant-related capital expenditures and for general capital improvements. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 2.0 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.1 million square feet of space held for future development and we also owned approximately 0.6 million net rentable square feet of data center space with extensive installed tenant improvements. Turn-Key Flex\u00ae space is move-in-ready space for the placement of computer and network equipment required to provide a data center environment. Depending on demand for additional Turn-Key Flex\u00ae space, we expect to incur significant tenant improvement costs to build out and develop these types of spaces. At December 31, 2016, approximately 2.0 million square feet was under construction for Turn-Key Flex\u00ae, colocation and Powered Base Building\u00ae products, all of which are expected to be income producing on or after completion, in six U.S. domestic metropolitan areas, three European metropolitan areas, one Canadian metropolitan area and one Asian metropolitan area, consisting of approximately 1.2 million square feet of base building construction and 0.8 million square feet of data center construction. At December 31, 2016, we had commitments under construction contracts for approximately $320.9 million. We currently expect to incur approximately $0.8 billion to $1.0 billion of capital expenditures\nfor our development programs during the year ending December 31, 2017, although this amount may increase or decrease, potentially materially, based on numerous factors, including changes in demand, leasing results and availability of debt or equity capital.\nHistorical Capital Expenditures\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development projects\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>573,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>523,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enhancement and improvements\n</td> <td>4,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recurring capital expenditures\n</td> <td>75,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures (excluding indirect costs)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>654,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>626,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, total capital expenditures increased $27.5 million to approximately $654.2 million from $626.7 million for the same period in 2015. Capital expenditures on our development projects plus our enhancement and improvements projects for the year ended December 31, 2016 were approximately $578.7 million, which reflects an increase of approximately 8% from the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to increased spending for ground-up development projects, Turn-Key Flex and base building improvements. Our development capital expenditures are generally funded by our available cash and equity and debt capital.\nIndirect costs related to construction and leasing activities, including capitalized interest, capitalized in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $85.2 million and $69.6 million, respectively. Capitalized interest comprised approximately $16.3 million and $12.9 million, respectively, of the total indirect costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Capitalized interest in the year ended December 31, 2016 increased compared to the same period in 2015 due to an increase in qualifying activities. Excluding capitalized interest, the indirect costs increased in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to capitalized amounts relating to compensation expense of employees directly engaged in construction and leasing activities. See -Future Uses of Cash\u201d above for a discussion of the amount of capital expenditures we expect to incur during the year ending December 31, 2017.\nThe environmental cleanup work required at the 47700 Kato Road and 1055 Page Avenue property resulting from a prior tenant's activities has been completed. The prior tenant of these buildings completed most of the remaining required environmental cleanup work. In January 2016, we sold this property to an unrelated third party. We continue to seek recovery of past costs incurred for previous environmental cleanup work, as well as other damages. We cannot at this time estimate the likelihood of recovery or the impact on our financial condition and results of operations, however, the amounts are not expected to be material.\nWe are also subject to the commitments discussed below under Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\u201d and Distributions.\u201d\nWe actively pursue opportunities for potential acquisitions, with due diligence and negotiations often at different stages at different times. The dollar value of acquisitions for the year ending December 31, 2017 will be based on numerous factors, including tenant demand, leasing results, availability of debt or equity capital and acquisition opportunities.\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt or the equity of our Parent Company through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities of our Parent Company in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions or other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nWe expect to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, including to pay for scheduled debt maturities and to fund property acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements, with net cash from operations, future long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of equity and debt securities and the proceeds of equity issuances by our Parent Company. We also may fund future short- and long-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements using our 2016 global revolving credit facility pending permanent financing. If we are not able to obtain additional financing on terms attractive to us, or at all, including as a result of the circumstances described above under Factors Which May Influence Future Results of Operations-Global market and economic conditions\u201d, we may be required to reduce our acquisition or capital expenditure plans, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations.\nDistributions\nAll distributions on our units are at the discretion of our Parent Company's board of directors.

The earnout contingency expires in November 2020. The maximum amount that could be earned by the seller is $50.0 million SGD (or approximately $34.5 million based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2016). As of December 31, 2014, $12.6 million had been accrued related to this earnout agreement, which was subsequently paid in 2015. During 2015 and 2016, the remaining performance targets were achieved and the Company accrued an additional $23.8 million. The remaining earnout payments were made in 2016 per the terms of the earnout agreement. The amounts accrued were discounted based on their expected payment date and capitalized to building and improvements as the original purchase was accounted for as an asset acquisition.\nOne of the tenants at our Convergence Business Park property has an option to expand as part of their lease agreement, which expires in April 2017. As part of this option, development activities were not permitted on specifically identified expansion space within the property until April 2014. From April 2014 through April 2017, the tenant has the right of first refusal on any third party's bona fide offer to buy the adjacent land. If the tenant exercises its option, we may either construct and lease to the tenant an additional shell building on the expansion space at a stipulated rate of return on cost or sell the existing building and the expansion space to the tenant for a price of approximately $24.0 million and $225,000 per acre,\nrespectively, plus additional adjustments as provided in the lease. As of December 31, 2016, the tenant had yet to exercise its option.\nAs part of the acquisition of the Sentrum Portfolio, the seller could earn additional consideration based on future net returns on vacant space to be developed, but not currently leased, as defined in the purchase agreement for the acquisition. The initial estimate of fair value of the contingent consideration liability was approximately \u00a356.5 million (or approximately $87.6 million based on the exchange rate as of July 11, 2012, the acquisition date). We have adjusted the contingent consideration to fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized in operating income. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reduced the fair value by approximately \u00a330.3 million (or approximately $45.9 million). The adjustment was the result of an evaluation by management that no additional leases would be executed for vacant space by July 11, 2015, the contingency expiration date. The final payment on the earnout was made in August 2015. We made earnout payments of approximately \u00a30.7 million (or approximately $1.1 million based on the exchange rates as of the date of each payment) during the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we made earnout payments of approximately \u00a36.2 million (or approximately $10.3 million based on the exchange rates as of the date of each payment). From the acquisition date through December 31, 2015, we made earnout payments of approximately \u00a323.8 million (or approximately $37.2 million based on the exchange rates as of the date of each payment). The earn-out contingency expired in July 2015. The change in fair value of contingent consideration for Sentrum was recorded as a reduction to operating expense of approximately $0.0 million, $43.0 million and $8.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOn July 22, 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement with former Chief Executive Officer Michael Foust, pursuant to which the parties acknowledged the cancellation of 127,644 profits interest units in the operating partnership held by Mr. Foust, and we agreed to pay Mr. Foust $8.0 million in full satisfaction of any and all amounts owing to Mr. Foust as a result of his employment with the Company and the termination thereof. In connection with the settlement, Mr. Foust and the Company agreed to dismiss with prejudice the litigation between the parties relating to Mr. Foust's employment and termination of employment, and each party released claims against the other party. We previously recorded an expense of approximately $12.7 million in connection with Mr. Foust's severance payments and reversed the excess expense of approximately $4.6 million in the three months ending September 30, 2015 as a reduction to general and administrative expense in the consolidated income statement.\nWe are currently a party to litigation related to the release of a sublease guarantee that was provided by one of our subsidiaries. Certain parties are seeking to invalidate the release, which freed our subsidiary from any further obligations under the sublease guarantee. We cannot at this time reliably estimate the likelihood of success or the impact on our financial condition and results of operations, however, the amounts are not expected to be material.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we were a party to interest rate swap agreements which hedge variability in cash flows related the U.S. LIBOR and SGD-SOR based tranches of the unsecured term loan. Under these swaps, we pay variable-rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amounts.

"item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this report entitled Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Certain risk factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the sections in this report entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOccupancy percentages included in the following discussion, for some of our properties, are calculated based on factors in addition to contractually leased square feet, including available power, required support space and common area.\nOverview\nOur Company. Digital Realty Trust, Inc. completed its initial public offering of common stock, or our IPO, on November 3, 2004. We believe that we have operated in a manner that has enabled us to qualify, and have elected to be treated, as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. Our Company was formed on March 9, 2004. During the period from our formation until we commenced operations in connection with the completion of our IPO, we did not have any corporate activity other than the issuance of shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock in connection with the initial capitalization of the Company. Our Operating Partnership was formed on July 21, 2004.\nBusiness and strategy. Our primary business objectives are to maximize: (i) sustainable long-term growth in earnings and funds from operations per share and unit, (ii) cash flow and returns to our stockholders and our Operating Partnership's unitholders through the payment of distributions and (iii) return on invested capital. We expect to achieve our objectives by focusing on our core business of investing in and developing data centers. A significant component of our current and future internal growth is anticipated through the development of our existing space held for development, acquisition of land for future development and acquisition of new properties. We target high quality, strategically located properties containing the physical and connectivity infrastructure that supports the applications and operations of data center and technology industry tenants and properties that may be developed for such use. Most of our data center properties contain fully redundant electrical supply systems, multiple power feeds, above-standard cooling systems, raised floor areas, extensive in-building communications cabling and high-level security systems. We focus exclusively on owning, acquiring, developing and operating data centers because we believe that the growth in data center demand and the technology-related real estate industry generally will continue to outpace the overall economy.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we owned an aggregate of 145 operating properties, including 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, with approximately 26.1 million rentable square feet including approximately 2.0 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.1 million square feet of space held for future development. The 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures have an aggregate of approximately 1.9 million rentable square feet. The 14 parcels of developable land we own comprised approximately 414 acres. At December 31, 2016, approximately 2.0 million square feet was under construction for Turn-Key Flex\u00ae, colocation and Powered Base Building\u00ae products, all of which are expected to be income producing on or after completion, in six U.S. domestic metropolitan areas, three European metropolitan areas, one Canadian metropolitan area and one Asian metropolitan area, consisting of approximately 1.2 million square feet of base building construction and 0.8 million square feet of data center construction.\nWe have developed detailed, standardized procedures for evaluating new real estate investments to ensure that they meet our financial, technical and other criteria. We expect to continue to acquire additional assets as a part of our growth strategy. We intend to aggressively manage and lease our assets to increase their cash flow. We may continue to build out our development portfolio when justified by anticipated returns.\nWe may acquire properties subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or we may incur new indebtedness in connection with acquiring or refinancing these properties. Debt service on such indebtedness will have a priority over any cash dividends with respect to Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s common stock and preferred stock. We currently intend to limit our indebtedness to 60% of our total enterprise value and, based on the closing price of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock on December 31, 2016 of $98.26, our ratio of debt to total enterprise value was approximately 26%. Our total enterprise value is defined as the sum of the market value of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s outstanding common stock (which may decrease, thereby increasing our debt to total enterprise value ratio), excluding options issued under our Amended and Restated 2004 Incentive Award Plan, plus the liquidation value of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s preferred stock, plus the aggregate value of\nour Operating Partnership's units not held by Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (with the per unit value equal to the market value of one share of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock and excluding long-term incentive units, Class C units and Class D units), plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness.\nRevenue base. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 145 operating properties through our Operating Partnership, including 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and developable land. These properties are mainly located throughout North America, with 32 properties located in Europe, four properties in Asia and three properties in Australia. We, through our predecessor, acquired our first portfolio property in January 2002 and have added properties through acquisition and development activities as follows:\n\n (1) Excludes properties sold: 114 Rue Ambroise Croizat (August 2016), 210 N. Tucker Boulevard (July 2016), 900 Walnut Street (July 2016), 251 Exchange Place (July 2016), 1807 Michael Faraday Court (July 2016), 47700 Kato Road and 1055 Page Avenue (January 2016), 650 Randolph Road (December 2015), 833 Chestnut Street (April 2015), 3300 East Birch Street (March 2015), 100 Quannapowitt (February 2015), 6 Braham Street (April 2014), 100 Technology Center Drive (March 2007), 4055 Valley View Lane (March 2007) and 7979 East Tufts Avenue (July 2006). In addition, also excludes 701 & 717 Leonard Street, a parking garage located adjacent to our internet gateway data center located at 2323 Bryan Street and not considered a separate property. Also excludes a leasehold interest acquired in March 2007 related to an acquisition made in 2006. Excludes 14 developable land parcels. Includes 12 properties held in our managed portfolio of unconsolidated joint ventures consisting of 4650 Old Ironsides Drive (Silicon Valley), 2950 Zanker Road (Silicon Valley), 4700 Old Ironsides Drive (Silicon Valley), 444 Toyama Drive (Silicon Valley), 43790 Devin Shafron Drive (Northern Virginia), 21551 Beaumeade Circle (Northern Virginia), 7505 Mason King Court (Northern Virginia), 14901 FAA Boulevard (Dallas), 900 Dorothy Drive (Dallas), 636 Pierce Street (New York), 43915 Devin Shafron Drive (Northern Virginia) and 33 Chun Choi Street (Hong Kong); and two properties held in our non-managed unconsolidated joint ventures consisting of 2001 Sixth Avenue (Seattle) and 2020 Fifth Avenue (Seattle). \n (2) Current net rentable square feet as of December 31, 2016, which represents the current square feet under lease as specified in the applicable lease agreements plus management's estimate of space available for lease based on engineering drawings. Includes tenants' proportional share of common areas but excludes space held for development. \n (3) Space under active development includes current base building and data center projects in progress. \n (4) Space held for future development includes space held for future data center development, and excludes space under active development. \n (5) As of December 31, 2016, there were three properties held for sale; two were acquired in 2004 and one in 2005. \n (6) Includes three developed buildings (43915 Devin Shafron Drive, 43830 Devin Shafron Drive and 43790 Devin Shafron Drive) placed into service in 2010 and 2011 that are being included with a property (Devin Shafron buildings) that was acquired in 2007. \n (7) Includes a developed building (21551 Beaumeade Circle) placed into service in 2011 that is being included with a property (Beaumeade Circle Portfolio) that was acquired in 2009. \n (8) Includes four developed buildings (43940 Digital Loudoun Plaza in Northern Virginia, 3825 NW Aloclek Place in Portland, Oregon, 98 Radnor Drive in Melbourne, Australia and 1-23 Templar Road in Sydney, Australia) placed into service in 2012 and 2013, on land parcels acquired in 2011. \n (9) 43790 Devin Shafron Drive and 21551 Beaumeade Circle, which were previously included as part of the Devin Shafron buildings and Beaumeade Circle Portfolio, respectively, are now each separately included in the property count because they were separately contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture in September 2013. \n (10) 43915 Devin Shafron Drive, which was previously included as part of the Devin Shafron buildings, is now separately included in the property count because it was separately contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture in September 2014. \n (11) Includes eight properties that were added as part of the Telx Acquisition, two of which are owned: 56 Marietta Street (Atlanta) and 100 Delawanna Avenue (New York); and six that are leased from third parties: 60 Hudson Street (New York), 32 Avenue of the Americas (New York), 2 Peekay Drive (New York), 2820 Northwestern Parkway (Silicon Valley), 8425 N. Stemmons Freeway (Dallas) and 3433 S. 120th Place (Seattle). Telx also leases space at 111 8th Avenue (New York), which is partially subleased by Telx from the Company and partially subleased from third parties. \n (12) Includes eight properties that were added as part of the European Portfolio Acquisition, one of which is owned, with the remaining seven being leased from third parties. \nAs of December 31, 2016, the properties in our portfolio, including the 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, were approximately 89.4% leased excluding approximately 2.0 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.1 million square feet of space held for future development. Due to the capital-intensive and long-term nature of the operations being supported, our lease terms are generally longer than standard commercial leases. As of December 31, 2016, our average remaining lease term is approximately five years. Our scheduled lease expirations through December 31, 2018 are 16.4% of rentable square feet excluding month-to-month leases, space under active development and space held for future development as of December 31, 2016.\nOn January 21, 2016, the Operating Partnership sold the 47700 Kato Road and 1055 Page Avenue property, two adjacent non-data center properties totaling 199,000 square feet in Fremont, California for $37.5 million. The sale generated net proceeds of $35.8 million and we recognized a gain on the sale of approximately $1.0 million. The properties were identified as held for sale as of December 31, 2015.\nThe Company granted Equinix an option to acquire the Company's facility in 114 rue Ambroise Croizat in Paris. Equinix elected to exercise its option to acquire the Paris property, and on July 2, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the property to Equinix for approximately \u20ac190 million (or approximately $212 million based on the exchange rate as of August 1, 2016). The Paris property sale closed on August 1, 2016. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of approximately $144.3 million in the third quarter of 2016. This property was classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2016.\nOn July 11, 2016, the Company closed on the sale of a four-property data center portfolio, including two in St. Louis and two in Northern Virginia totaling over 454,000 square feet for approximately $114.5 million. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of approximately $24.5 million in the third quarter of 2016. The four properties were classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2016.\nNone of the Company's property sales to date represented a significant component or significant shift in strategy that would require discontinued operations presentation.\nFactors Which May Influence Future Results of Operations\nGlobal market and economic conditions. General economic conditions and the cost and availability of capital may be adversely affected in some or all of the metropolitan areas in which we own properties and conduct our operations. In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum. The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the United Kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process. Nevertheless, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and has given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal. Instability in the U.S., European, Asia Pacific and other international financial markets and economies may adversely affect our ability, and the ability of our tenants, to replace or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis, access the capital markets to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements and may result in adverse effects on our, and our tenants', financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our access to funds under our global revolving credit facility depends on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to us. We cannot assure you that long-term disruptions in the global economy and the return of tighter credit conditions among, and potential failures or nationalizations of, third party financial institutions as a result of such disruptions will not have an adverse effect on our lenders. If our lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to us, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not have sufficient cash flow to continue operating our business and are unable to borrow additional funds, access our existing lines of credit or raise equity or debt capital, we may need to source alternative ways to increase our liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation, curtailing development activity, disposing of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms or entering into or renewing leases on less favorable terms than we otherwise would.\nForeign currency exchange risk. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had foreign operations in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, The Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Japan and Hong Kong, and, as such, are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements of foreign currencies, which may affect future costs and cash flows. Our foreign operations are conducted in the British pound sterling, Euro, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar, Japanese Yen and the Hong Kong dollar. Our primary currency exposures are to the British pound sterling, the Euro and the Singapore dollar. The possible exit of the United Kingdom (or any other country) from the European Union or prolonged periods of uncertainty relating to any of these possibilities, could result in increased foreign currency exchange volatility. We attempt to mitigate a portion of the risk of currency fluctuation by financing our investments in the local currency denominations, although there can be no assurance that this will be effective. As a result, changes in the relation of any such foreign currency to U.S. dollars may affect our revenues, operating margins and distributions and may also affect the book value of our assets and the amount of stockholders' equity.\nRental income. The amount of rental income generated by the properties in our portfolio depends on several factors, including our ability to maintain or improve the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space available from lease terminations. Excluding approximately 2.0 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.1 million square feet of space held for future development as of December 31, 2016, the occupancy rate of the properties in our portfolio, including the 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 89.4% of our net rentable square feet.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had over 2,200 tenants in our portfolio, including the 12 properties held in our managed portfolio of unconsolidated joint ventures. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 91% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained base rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 2% to 4%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other similar inflation related index. We cannot assure you that these escalations will cover any increases in our costs or will otherwise keep rental rates at or above market rates.\nThe amount of rental income we generate also depends on maintaining or increasing rental rates at our properties, which in turn depends on several factors, including supply and demand and market rates for data center space. Included in our approximately 21.1 million net rentable square feet, excluding space under active development and space held for future development and 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, at December 31, 2016 is approximately 0.8 million square feet of data center space with extensive installed tenant improvements available for lease. Since our IPO, we have leased over 4.5 million square feet of similar space, including Turn-Key Flex\u00ae space. Our Turn-Key Flex\u00ae product is an effective solution for tenants who prefer to utilize a partner with the expertise or capital budget to provide extensive data center infrastructure and security. Our expertise in data center construction and operations enables us to lease space to these tenants at a premium over other uses. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 2.0 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.1 million square feet of space held for future development, or approximately 12% of the total rentable space in our portfolio, including the 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Our\nability to grow earnings depends in part on our ability to develop space and lease development space at favorable rates, which we may not be able to obtain. Development space requires significant capital investment in order to develop data center facilities that are ready for use and, in addition, we may require additional time or encounter delays in securing tenants for development space. We may purchase additional vacant properties and properties with vacant development space in the future. We will require additional capital to finance our development activities, which may not be available or may not be available on terms acceptable to us, including as a result of the conditions described above under Global market and economic conditions.\u201d\nIn addition, the timing between when we sign a new lease with a tenant and when that lease commences and we begin to generate rental income may be significant and may not be easily predictable. Certain leases may provide for staggered commencement dates for additional space, the timing of which may be delayed significantly.\nEconomic downturns, including as a result of the conditions described above under Global market and economic conditions,\u201d or regional downturns affecting our metropolitan areas or downturns in the technology-related real estate industry that impair our ability to lease or renew or re-lease space, or otherwise reduce returns on our investments or the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments, as in the case of tenant bankruptcies, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties.\nScheduled lease expirations. Our ability to re-lease expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates will impact our results of operations. In addition to approximately 2.4 million square feet of available space in our portfolio, which excludes approximately 2.0 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.1 million square feet of space held for future development as of December 31, 2016 and the two properties held as investments in our non-managed unconsolidated joint ventures, leases representing approximately 6.8% and 9.6% of the net rentable square footage of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we signed new leases totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet of space and renewal leases totaling approximately 1.4 million square feet of space. The following table summarizes our leasing activity in the year ended December 31, 2016:\n\n (1) For some of our properties, we calculate square footage based on factors in addition to contractually leased square feet, including power, required support space and common area. \n (2) Rental rates represent annual estimated cash rent per rentable square foot adjusted for straight-line rents in accordance with GAAP. GAAP rental rates are inclusive of tenant concessions, if any. \n (3) Excludes short-term leases. \n (4) Commencement dates for the leases signed range from 2016 to 2018. \n (5) Includes leases signed for new and re-leased space.  Our ability to re-lease or renew expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates will impact our results of operations. We continue to see strong demand in most of our key metropolitan areas for data center space and, subject to the supply of available data center space in these metropolitan areas, expect the rental rates we are likely to achieve on re-leased or renewed data center space leases for 2017 expirations on an average aggregate basis will generally be higher than the rates currently being paid for the same space on a GAAP basis and flat on a cash basis. For the year ended December 31, 2016, rents on renewed space increased by an average of 10.2% on a GAAP basis on our Turn-Key Flex\u00ae space compared to the expiring rents and increased by an average of 22.9% on a GAAP basis on our Powered Base Building\u00ae space compared to the expiring rents. Our past performance may not be indicative of future results, and we cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our properties will be re-leased at all or at rental rates equal to or above the current average rental rates. Further, re-leased/renewed rental rates in a particular metropolitan area may not be consistent with rental rates across our portfolio as a whole and may fluctuate from one period to another due to a number of factors, including local real estate conditions, local supply and demand for data center space, competition from other data center developers or operators, the condition of the property and whether the property, or space within the property, has been developed.\nGeographic concentration. We depend on the market for data centers in specific geographic regions and significant changes in these regional metropolitan areas can impact our future results. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio, including the 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, was geographically concentrated in the following metropolitan areas:\n\n (1) Annualized rent is monthly contractual rent (defined as cash base rent before abatements) under existing leases as of December 31, 2016 multiplied by 12. The aggregate amount of abatements for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $16.2 million.  Operating expenses. Our operating expenses generally consist of utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, property management fees, insurance and site maintenance costs, as well as rental expenses on our ground and building leases. In particular, our buildings require significant power to support the data center operations contained in them. Many of our leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for all or a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us. However, we generally are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses, other than utility expense, and real estate taxes under our leases for Turn-Key Flex\u00ae facilities. We also incur general and administrative expenses, including expenses relating to our asset management function, as well as significant legal, accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance, SEC reporting and compliance with the various provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct. Increases or decreases in such operating expenses will impact our overall performance. We expect to incur additional operating expenses as we continue to expand.\nClimate change legislation. In June 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives approved comprehensive clean energy and climate change legislation intended to cut greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions, via a cap-and-trade program. The U.S. Senate did not subsequently pass similar legislation. New climate change legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate in 2013, but significant opposition to federal climate change legislation exists.\nIn the absence of comprehensive federal climate change legislation, over the past several years, regulatory agencies, primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and states took the lead in regulating GHG emissions in the U.S. Under the Obama administration, EPA moved aggressively to regulate GHG emissions from automobiles and large stationary sources, including electricity producers, using its own authority under the Clean Air Act. The Trump administration has signaled that it intends to eliminate or modify certain of the EPA's GHG emissions regulations and refocus EPA's mission away from such regulation.\nThe EPA made an endangerment finding in 2009 that allows it to create regulations imposing emissions reporting, permitting, control technology installation, and monitoring requirements applicable to certain emitters of GHGs, including facilities that provide electricity to our data centers, although the materiality of the impacts will not be fully known until all regulations are finalized and legal challenges are resolved. Under the Obama administration, the EPA finalized rules imposing permitting and control technology requirements upon certain newly-constructed or modified facilities which emit GHGs under the Clean Air Act New Source Review Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or NSR PSD, and Title V permitting programs. As a result, newly-issued NSR PSD and Title V permits for new or modified electricity generating units (EGUs) and other facilities may need to address GHG emissions, including by requiring the installation of Best Available Control Technology.\u201d The EPA implemented in December 2015 the Clean Power Plan\u201d regulating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from new and existing coal-fired and natural gas EGUs. Existing EGUs are subject to statewide CO2 emissions reduction targets, an effort designed to achieve a thirty-two percent reduction in nationwide existing EGU CO2 emissions by 2030 (in comparison to 2005 levels). New, modified, and reconstructed EGUs are subject to New Source Performance Standards\u201d that include both technological requirements and numeric emission limits. However, twenty-four states and a number of industry groups challenged the Clean Power Plan in federal court, and in February 2016 the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the Clean Power Plan until the legal challenges have been decided. Further, President Trump has voiced opposition to the Clean Power Plan, and he could seek to eliminate it. Separately, the EPA's GHG reporting rule\u201d requires that certain emitters, including electricity generators, monitor and report GHG emissions. The Trump administration may seek to revise or reverse these regulations.\nAs a result, states may drive near-term regulation to reduce GHG emissions in the United States. At the state level, California implemented a GHG cap-and-trade program that began imposing compliance obligations on industrial sectors, including electricity generators and importers, in January 2013. In September 2016, California adopted legislation calling for a further reduction in GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.\nOutside the United States, the European Union, or EU (including the United Kingdom), has been operating since 2005 under a cap-and-trade program, which directly affects the largest emitters of GHGs, including electricity producers from whom we purchase power, and the EU has taken a number of other climate change-related initiatives, including a directive targeted at improving energy efficiency (which introduces energy efficiency auditing requirements). The Paris Agreement, which was adopted by the United States and 194 other countries and looks to prevent global average temperatures from increasing by more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels officially went into force on November 4, 2016. However, President Trump has signaled that he may withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. National legislation may also be implemented independently by members of the EU. For example, in the United Kingdom, the implementation of the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme introduced a mandatory reporting and pricing scheme that is designed to incentivize energy efficiency and cut emissions by large energy users. It is not yet clear how Brexit will impact the United Kingdom's (or the EU's) approach to climate change regulation. In Canada, the first compliance period under Ontario's GHG cap-and-trade program began in January 2017. Climate change regulations are in various stages of implementation in other nations as well, including nations where we operate, such as Australia, where a GHG emissions cap was implemented in 2016.\nThe cost of electric power comprises a significant component of our operating expenses. Any additional taxation or regulation of energy use, including as a result of (i) new legislation that Congress may pass, (ii) the regulations that the EPA has proposed or finalized, (iii) regulations under legislation that states have passed or may pass, or (iv) any further legislation or regulations in the EU or other regions where we operate could significantly increase our costs, and we may not be able to effectively pass all of these costs on to our tenants. These matters could adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nInterest rates. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.1 billion of variable rate debt subject to interest rate swap agreements on certain tranches of our unsecured term loan, along with $210.1 million and $364.3 million of variable rate debt that was outstanding on the 2016 global revolving credit facility and the unswapped portion of the 2016 unsecured term loan, respectively. The availability of debt and equity capital may decrease or be on unfavorable terms as a result of the circumstances described above under Global market and economic conditions\u201d or other factors. The effects on commercial real estate mortgages, if available, include, but may not be limited to: higher loan spreads, tightened loan covenants, reduced loan-to-value ratios resulting in lower borrower proceeds and higher principal payments. Potential future increases in interest rates and credit spreads may increase our interest expense and fixed charges and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, potentially impacting our future access to the debt and equity capital markets. Increased interest rates may also increase the risk that the counterparties to our swap agreements will default on their obligations, which could further increase our interest expense. If we cannot obtain capital from third party sources, we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist, satisfy our debt service obligations or pay the cash dividends to Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s stockholders necessary to maintain its qualification as a REIT.\nDemand for data center space. Our portfolio of properties consists primarily of data centers. A decrease in the demand for, or increase in supply of, data center space, Internet gateway facilities or other technology-related real estate would have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition than if we owned a portfolio with a more diversified tenant base or less specialized use. We have invested in building out additional inventory primarily in what we anticipate will be our active major metropolitan areas prior to having executed leases with respect to this space. We believe that demand in key metropolitan areas such as Northern Virginia, Dallas and Chicago is largely in line with supply. We also continue to see strong demand in other key metropolitan areas across our portfolio. However, until this inventory is leased up, which will depend on a number of factors, including available data center space in these metropolitan areas, our return on invested capital is negatively impacted. Our development activities make us particularly susceptible to general economic slowdowns, including recessions and the other circumstances described above under Global market and economic conditions,\u201d as well as adverse developments in the data center, Internet and data communications and broader technology industries. Any such slowdown or adverse development could lead to reduced corporate IT spending or reduced demand for data center space. Reduced demand could also result from business relocations, including to metropolitan areas that we do not currently serve. Changes in industry practice or in technology, such as virtualization technology, more efficient computing or networking devices, or devices that require higher power densities than today's devices, could also reduce demand for the physical data center space we provide or make the tenant improvements in our facilities obsolete or in need of significant upgrades to remain viable. In addition, the development of new technologies, the adoption of new industry standards or other factors could render many of our tenants' current products and services obsolete or unmarketable and contribute to a downturn in their businesses, thereby increasing the likelihood that they default under their leases, become insolvent or file for bankruptcy. In addition, demand for data center space in our properties, or the rates at which we lease space, may be adversely impacted either across our portfolio or in specific metropolitan areas as a result of an increase in the number of competitors, or the amount of space being offered in our metropolitan areas and other metropolitan areas by our competitors.\nTelx and European Portfolio Acquisitions. We believe that the acquisitions of Telx and the European Portfolio will provide a number of strategic and financial benefits, including providing us a leading colocation and interconnection platform, a premium connectivity infrastructure and enhanced growth potential in attractive locations. However, there can be no assurance that we will realize the intended benefits of the Telx Acquisition and the European Portfolio Acquisition and they may divert management's attention, and disrupt our plans and operations. In addition, we may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities related to Telx and the European Portfolio for which we may have no or limited recourse against the sellers.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in Item 8, Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We describe below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. Our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date on the front cover of this report.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nAcquisition of real estate. The price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors including the condition of the property and improvements, the occupancy of the building, the term and rate of in-place leases, the creditworthiness of the tenants, favorable or unfavorable financing, above- or below-market ground leases and numerous other factors.\nAccordingly, we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the identifiable assets including intangibles and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair value of such assets and liabilities. This includes determining the value of the property and improvements, land, ground leases, if any, and tenant improvements. Additionally, we evaluate the value of in-place leases on occupancy and market rent, the value of the tenant relationships, the value (or negative value) of above- (or below-) market leases, any debt or deferred taxes assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us and any building leases assumed from the seller. Each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations. For example, if we were to allocate more value to land, there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount. If we were to allocate more value to the property as opposed to allocating to the value of in-place tenant leases, this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time. This potential effect occurs because the amounts allocated to property are depreciated over the estimated lives of the property whereas amounts allocated to in-place tenant leases are amortized over the estimated term (including renewal and extension assumptions) of the leases. Additionally, the amortization of the value (or negative value) assigned to above- (or below-) market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in-place tenant leases and tenant relationships, which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated income statements.\nFrom time to time, we will receive offers for sale of our properties, either solicited or unsolicited. For those offers that are accepted, the prospective buyer will usually require a due diligence period before consummation of the transaction. It is not unusual for matters to arise that result in the withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this process. We classify real estate as held for sale\u201d when all criteria under the GAAP guidance have been met.\nCapitalization of costs. Direct and indirect project costs that are clearly associated with the development of properties are capitalized as incurred. Project costs include all costs directly associated with the development of a property, including construction costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, legal fees and costs of personnel working on the project. Indirect costs that do not clearly relate to the projects under development are not capitalized and are charged to expense as incurred.\nCapitalization of costs begins when the activities necessary to get the development project ready for its intended use begin, which include costs incurred before the beginning of construction. Capitalization of costs ceases when the development project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Determining when a development project commences and when it is substantially complete and ready for its intended use involves a degree of judgment. We generally consider a development project to be substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy. If and when development of a property is suspended pursuant to a formal change in the planned use of the property, we will evaluate whether the accumulated costs exceed the estimated value of the project and write off the amount of any such excess accumulated costs. For a development project that is suspended for reasons other than a formal change in the planned use of such property, the accumulated project costs are evaluated for impairment consistent with our impairment policies for long-lived assets. Capitalized costs are allocated to the specific components of a project that are benefited.\nUseful lives of assets. We are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate. These assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate such investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.\nAsset impairment evaluation. We review each of our properties for indicators that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of the property, a change in the expected holding period for the property, a significant adverse change in how the property is being used or expected to be used based on the underwriting at the time of acquisition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development of the property, or a history of operating or cash flow losses of the property. When such impairment indicators exist, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows (excluding interest charges) expected to result from the real estate investment's use and eventual disposition and compare that estimate to the carrying value of the property. We consider factors such as future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If our future undiscounted net cash flow evaluation indicates that we are unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. These losses have a direct impact on our net income because recording an\nimpairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether the carrying value of a property is recoverable, our strategy of holding properties over the long-term directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable and therefore requiring the recording of an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that the asset fails the recoverability test, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value.\nWe generally estimate the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues, expenses and capital improvement costs that a market participant would use based on the highest and best use of the asset, which is similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers. In certain cases, we may supplement this analysis by obtaining outside broker opinions of value.\nRevenue Recognition\nRental revenue is recognized using the straight-line method over the terms of the tenant leases. Deferred rents included in our consolidated balance sheets represent the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized to date on a straight-line basis versus the contractual rental payments under the terms of the leases. Many of our leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us. However, we generally are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses, other than utility expense, and real estate taxes under our leases for Turn-Key Flex\u00ae facilities. Such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred. Lease termination fees are recognized over the remaining term of the lease, effective as of the date the lease modification is finalized, assuming collection is not considered doubtful. As discussed above, we recognize amortization of the value of acquired above- or below-market tenant leases as a reduction of rental revenue in the case of above-market leases or an increase to rental revenue in the case of below-market leases.\nWe must make subjective estimates as to when our revenue is earned and the collectability of our accounts receivable related to minimum rent, deferred rent, expense reimbursements, lease termination fees and other income. We specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, tenant concentrations, tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts. These estimates have a direct impact on our net revenue because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net revenue, and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net revenue for a particular period.\nShare-Based Awards\nWe recognize compensation expense related to share-based awards. We generally amortize this compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. The calculation of the fair value of share-based awards is subjective and requires several assumptions over such items as expected stock volatility, dividend payments and future company results. These assumptions have a direct impact on our net income because a higher share-based awards amount would result in lower net income for a particular period.\nResults of Operations\nThe discussion below relates to our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. A summary of our operating results from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was as follows (in thousands).\n\nOur property portfolio has experienced consistent and significant growth since the first property acquisition in January 2002. As a result of this growth, our period-to-period comparison of our financial performance focuses on the impact on our revenues and expenses on a stabilized portfolio basis. Our stabilized portfolio includes properties owned as of December 31, 2014 with less than 5% of total rentable square feet under development and excludes properties that were undergoing, or were expected to undergo, development activities in 2015-2016 and properties sold or contributed to joint ventures.\nWe acquired the following real estate properties during the year ended December 31, 2016:\n2016 Acquisitions\n\n (1) On July 5, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of a portfolio of 8 high-quality, carrier-neutral data centers in Europe from Equinix, which we refer to as the European Portfolio Acquisition. The purchase price was $818.9 million in the aggregate (based on the exchange rate at the date of acquisition). \n (2) Represents currently vacant land which is not included in our operating property count. We completed 4 acquisitions of land parcels in the three months ended September 30, 2016 in Northern Virginia, Dallas and Chicago. Excludes capitalized closing costs on land acquisitions. \nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Year Ended December 31, 2015 and Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nPortfolio\nAs of December 31, 2016, our portfolio consisted of 145 operating properties, including 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and developable land, with an aggregate of 26.1 million rentable square feet including 2.0 million square feet of space under active development and 1.1 million square feet of space held for future development compared to a portfolio consisting of 139 operating properties, including 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and developable land, with an aggregate of 25.6 million rentable square feet including 1.3 million square feet of space under active development and 1.3 million square feet of space held for future development as of December 31, 2015 and a portfolio consisting of 131 operating properties, including 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and developable land, with an aggregate of 24.5 million rentable square feet including 1.8 million square feet of space under active development and 1.3 million square feet of space held for future development as of December 31, 2014.\nRevenues\nTotal operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe following tables show revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 for stabilized properties and pre-stabilized properties and other (all other properties) (in thousands). Stabilized results for the year ended December 31, 2015 are shown prior to Telx-related eliminations that were completed in arriving at our consolidated financial results. In an effort to make 2016 and 2015 stabilized results comparable, total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 are shown prior to Telx-related eliminations totaling $62.1 million. Revenue totals for pre-stabilized and other include: results from properties that have not yet met the definition of stabilized (including the eight properties acquired from Telx), properties that are classified as held for sale or were sold during the period, and the net Telx-related elimination of $62.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\nStabilized rental revenues and tenant reimbursement revenues remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as a result of new leasing at our properties during the year ended December 31, 2016, the largest of which were for space at 2121 South Price Road and 2045 & 2055 Lafayette Street, offset by the British pound sterling and Euro weakening against the U.S. dollar.\nPre-stabilized and other revenue increases during the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily a result of the Telx Acquisition and the European Portfolio Acquisition, which contributed approximately $209.0 million and $157.8 million to rental revenue and interconnection revenue, respectively, along with new leases at our properties during the year ended December 31, 2016, which were primarily leases of completed development space, the largest of which were for space at 44060 Digital Loudoun Plaza, 907 Security Row, 29A International Business Park and 9355 Grand Avenue, offset by a decrease in revenues as a result of properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\nStabilized rental revenues and tenant reimbursement revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 primarily as a result of newly vacant space at certain properties along with the British pound sterling and Euro weakening against the U.S. dollar, which was offset by new or renewed leases at certain of our properties during the year ended December 31, 2015, the largest of which were for space at 350 East Cermak Road, 4025 Midway Road and 1350 Duane Avenue.\nPre-stabilized and other revenue increases during the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily a result of the Telx Acquisition, which contributed approximately $42.2 million and $38.9 million to rental revenue and interconnection revenue, respectively, along with new leases at our properties during the year ended December 31, 2015, which were primarily leases of completed development space, the largest of which were for space at 44060 Digital Loudoun Plaza, 29A International Business Park, Principal Park, Crawley and 2121 South Price Road.\nFee Income\nOccasionally, customers engage the Company for certain services. The nature of these services historically involves property management, construction management, and assistance with financing. The proper revenue recognition of these services can be different, depending on whether the arrangements are service revenue or contractor type revenue. Service revenues are typically recognized on an equal monthly basis based on the minimum fee to be earned. The monthly amounts could be adjusted depending on if", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this report entitled Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Certain risk factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the sections in this report entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOccupancy percentages included in the following discussion, for some of our properties, are calculated based on factors in addition to contractually leased square feet, including available power, required support space and common area.\nOverview\nOur Company. Digital Realty Trust, Inc. completed its initial public offering of common stock, or our IPO, on November 3, 2004. We believe that we have operated in a manner that has enabled us to qualify, and have elected to be treated, as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. Our Company was formed on March 9, 2004. During the period from our formation until we commenced operations in connection with the completion of our IPO, we did not have any corporate activity other than the issuance of shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock in connection with the initial capitalization of the Company. Our Operating Partnership was formed on July 21, 2004.\nBusiness and strategy. Our primary business objectives are to maximize: (i) sustainable long-term growth in earnings and funds from operations per share and unit, (ii) cash flow and returns to our stockholders and our Operating Partnership's unitholders through the payment of distributions and (iii) return on invested capital. We expect to achieve our objectives by focusing on our core business of investing in and developing data centers. A significant component of our current and future internal growth is anticipated through the development of our existing space held for development, acquisition of land for future development and acquisition of new properties. We target high quality, strategically located properties containing the physical and connectivity infrastructure that supports the applications and operations of data center and technology industry tenants and properties that may be developed for such use. Most of our data center properties contain fully redundant electrical supply systems, multiple power feeds, above-standard cooling systems, raised floor areas, extensive in-building communications cabling and high-level security systems. We focus exclusively on owning, acquiring, developing and operating data centers because we believe that the growth in data center demand and the technology-related real estate industry generally will continue to outpace the overall economy.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we owned an aggregate of 145 operating properties, including 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, with approximately 26.1 million rentable square feet including approximately 2.0 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.1 million square feet of space held for future development. The 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures have an aggregate of approximately 1.9 million rentable square feet. The 14 parcels of developable land we own comprised approximately 414 acres. At December 31, 2016, approximately 2.0 million square feet was under construction for Turn-Key Flex\u00ae, colocation and Powered Base Building\u00ae products, all of which are expected to be income producing on or after completion, in six U.S. domestic metropolitan areas, three European metropolitan areas, one Canadian metropolitan area and one Asian metropolitan area, consisting of approximately 1.2 million square feet of base building construction and 0.8 million square feet of data center construction.\nWe have developed detailed, standardized procedures for evaluating new real estate investments to ensure that they meet our financial, technical and other criteria. We expect to continue to acquire additional assets as a part of our growth strategy. We intend to aggressively manage and lease our assets to increase their cash flow. We may continue to build out our development portfolio when justified by anticipated returns.\nWe may acquire properties subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or we may incur new indebtedness in connection with acquiring or refinancing these properties. Debt service on such indebtedness will have a priority over any cash dividends with respect to Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s common stock and preferred stock. We currently intend to limit our indebtedness to 60% of our total enterprise value and, based on the closing price of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock on December 31, 2016 of $98.26, our ratio of debt to total enterprise value was approximately 26%. Our total enterprise value is defined as the sum of the market value of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s outstanding common stock (which may decrease, thereby increasing our debt to total enterprise value ratio), excluding options issued under our Amended and Restated 2004 Incentive Award Plan, plus the liquidation value of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s preferred stock, plus the aggregate value of\nour Operating Partnership's units not held by Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (with the per unit value equal to the market value of one share of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock and excluding long-term incentive units, Class C units and Class D units), plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness.\nRevenue base. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 145 operating properties through our Operating Partnership, including 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and developable land. These properties are mainly located throughout North America, with 32 properties located in Europe, four properties in Asia and three properties in Australia. We, through our predecessor, acquired our first portfolio property in January 2002 and have added properties through acquisition and development activities as follows:\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31:\n</td> <td>Operating Properties\nAcquired (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Rentable\nSquare Feet(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Square Feet of Space Under Active Development as of December 31, 2016 (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Square Feet of Space Held for Future Development as of December 31, 2016 (4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2002\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,065,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2003\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>821,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2004\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5)\n</td> <td>2,375,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2005\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5)\n</td> <td>2,777,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2006\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,509,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2007\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6)\n</td> <td>1,378,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2008\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>481,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2009\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7)(9)(10)\n</td> <td>1,894,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>321,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2010\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,562,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2011\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8)\n</td> <td>1,887,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>319,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2012\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,814,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,141,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>329,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11)\n</td> <td>929,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>276,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12)\n</td> <td>373,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>514,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating properties owned as of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,010,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,020,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,081,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Excludes properties sold: 114 Rue Ambroise Croizat (August 2016), 210 N.

Due to the capital-intensive and long-term nature of the operations being supported, our lease terms are generally longer than standard commercial leases. As of December 31, 2016, our average remaining lease term is approximately five years. Our scheduled lease expirations through December 31, 2018 are 16.4% of rentable square feet excluding month-to-month leases, space under active development and space held for future development as of December 31, 2016.\nOn January 21, 2016, the Operating Partnership sold the 47700 Kato Road and 1055 Page Avenue property, two adjacent non-data center properties totaling 199,000 square feet in Fremont, California for $37.5 million.

Equinix elected to exercise its option to acquire the Paris property, and on July 2, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the property to Equinix for approximately \u20ac190 million (or approximately $212 million based on the exchange rate as of August 1, 2016). The Paris property sale closed on August 1, 2016. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of approximately $144.3 million in the third quarter of 2016. This property was classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2016.\nOn July 11, 2016, the Company closed on the sale of a four-property data center portfolio, including two in St. Louis and two in Northern Virginia totaling over 454,000 square feet for approximately $114.5 million. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of approximately $24.5 million in the third quarter of 2016. The four properties were classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2016.\nNone of the Company's property sales to date represented a significant component or significant shift in strategy that would require discontinued operations presentation.\nFactors Which May Influence Future Results of Operations\nGlobal market and economic conditions. General economic conditions and the cost and availability of capital may be adversely affected in some or all of the metropolitan areas in which we own properties and conduct our operations. In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum. The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the United Kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process. Nevertheless, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and has given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal. Instability in the U.S., European, Asia Pacific and other international financial markets and economies may adversely affect our ability, and the ability of our tenants, to replace or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis, access the capital markets to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements and may result in adverse effects on our, and our tenants', financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our access to funds under our global revolving credit facility depends on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to us. We cannot assure you that long-term disruptions in the global economy and the return of tighter credit conditions among, and potential failures or nationalizations of, third party financial institutions as a result of such disruptions will not have an adverse effect on our lenders. If our lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to us, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not have sufficient cash flow to continue operating our business and are unable to borrow additional funds, access our existing lines of credit or raise equity or debt capital, we may need to source alternative ways to increase our liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation, curtailing development activity, disposing of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms or entering into or renewing leases on less favorable terms than we otherwise would.\nForeign currency exchange risk. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had foreign operations in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, The Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Japan and Hong Kong, and, as such, are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements of foreign currencies, which may affect future costs and cash flows. Our foreign operations are conducted in the British pound sterling, Euro, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar, Japanese Yen and the Hong Kong dollar. Our primary currency exposures are to the British pound sterling, the Euro and the Singapore dollar. The possible exit of the United Kingdom (or any other country) from the European Union or prolonged periods of uncertainty relating to any of these possibilities, could result in increased foreign currency exchange volatility. We attempt to mitigate a portion of the risk of currency fluctuation by financing our investments in the local currency denominations, although there can be no assurance that this will be effective. As a result, changes in the relation of any such foreign currency to U.S. dollars may affect our revenues, operating margins and distributions and may also affect the book value of our assets and the amount of stockholders' equity.\nRental income. The amount of rental income generated by the properties in our portfolio depends on several factors, including our ability to maintain or improve the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space available from lease terminations. Excluding approximately 2.0 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.1 million square feet of space held for future development as of December 31, 2016, the occupancy rate of the properties in our portfolio, including the 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 89.4% of our net rentable square feet.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had over 2,200 tenants in our portfolio, including the 12 properties held in our managed portfolio of unconsolidated joint ventures. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 91% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained base rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 2% to 4%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other similar inflation related index. We cannot assure you that these escalations will cover any increases in our costs or will otherwise keep rental rates at or above market rates.\nThe amount of rental income we generate also depends on maintaining or increasing rental rates at our properties, which in turn depends on several factors, including supply and demand and market rates for data center space. Included in our approximately 21.1 million net rentable square feet, excluding space under active development and space held for future development and 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, at December 31, 2016 is approximately 0.8 million square feet of data center space with extensive installed tenant improvements available for lease. Since our IPO, we have leased over 4.5 million square feet of similar space, including Turn-Key Flex\u00ae space. Our Turn-Key Flex\u00ae product is an effective solution for tenants who prefer to utilize a partner with the expertise or capital budget to provide extensive data center infrastructure and security. Our expertise in data center construction and operations enables us to lease space to these tenants at a premium over other uses. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 2.0 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.1 million square feet of space held for future development, or approximately 12% of the total rentable space in our portfolio, including the 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Our\nability to grow earnings depends in part on our ability to develop space and lease development space at favorable rates, which we may not be able to obtain. Development space requires significant capital investment in order to develop data center facilities that are ready for use and, in addition, we may require additional time or encounter delays in securing tenants for development space. We may purchase additional vacant properties and properties with vacant development space in the future. We will require additional capital to finance our development activities, which may not be available or may not be available on terms acceptable to us, including as a result of the conditions described above under Global market and economic conditions.\u201d\nIn addition, the timing between when we sign a new lease with a tenant and when that lease commences and we begin to generate rental income may be significant and may not be easily predictable. Certain leases may provide for staggered commencement dates for additional space, the timing of which may be delayed significantly.\nEconomic downturns, including as a result of the conditions described above under Global market and economic conditions,\u201d or regional downturns affecting our metropolitan areas or downturns in the technology-related real estate industry that impair our ability to lease or renew or re-lease space, or otherwise reduce returns on our investments or the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments, as in the case of tenant bankruptcies, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties.\nScheduled lease expirations. Our ability to re-lease expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates will impact our results of operations. In addition to approximately 2.4 million square feet of available space in our portfolio, which excludes approximately 2.0 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.1 million square feet of space held for future development as of December 31, 2016 and the two properties held as investments in our non-managed unconsolidated joint ventures, leases representing approximately 6.8% and 9.6% of the net rentable square footage of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we signed new leases totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet of space and renewal leases totaling approximately 1.4 million square feet of space. The following table summarizes our leasing activity in the year ended December 31, 2016:\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

properties, we calculate square footage based on factors in addition to contractually leased square feet, including power, required support space and common area. \n (2) Rental rates represent annual estimated cash rent per rentable square foot adjusted for straight-line rents in accordance with GAAP. GAAP rental rates are inclusive of tenant concessions, if any. \n (3) Excludes short-term leases. \n (4) Commencement dates for the leases signed range from 2016 to 2018. \n (5) Includes leases signed for new and re-leased space.  Our ability to re-lease or renew expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates will impact our results of operations. We continue to see strong demand in most of our key metropolitan areas for data center space and, subject to the supply of available data center space in these metropolitan areas, expect the rental rates we are likely to achieve on re-leased or renewed data center space leases for 2017 expirations on an average aggregate basis will generally be higher than the rates currently being paid for the same space on a GAAP basis and flat on a cash basis. For the year ended December 31, 2016, rents on renewed space increased by an average of 10.2% on a GAAP basis on our Turn-Key Flex\u00ae space compared to the expiring rents and increased by an average of 22.9% on a GAAP basis on our Powered Base Building\u00ae space compared to the expiring rents. Our past performance may not be indicative of future results, and we cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our properties will be re-leased at all or at rental rates equal to or above the current average rental rates. Further, re-leased/renewed rental rates in a particular metropolitan area may not be consistent with rental rates across our portfolio as a whole and may fluctuate from one period to another due to a number of factors, including local real estate conditions, local supply and demand for data center space, competition from other data center developers or operators, the condition of the property and whether the property, or space within the property, has been developed.\nGeographic concentration. We depend on the market for data centers in specific geographic regions and significant changes in these regional metropolitan areas can impact our future results. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio, including the 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, was geographically concentrated in the following metropolitan areas:\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metropolitan Area\n</td> <td>Percentage of December 31, 2016 total annualized rent (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New York\n</td> <td>11.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Northern Virginia\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>London, United Kingdom\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dallas\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silicon Valley\n</td> <td>8.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chicago\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Phoenix\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>San Francisco\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Singapore\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Atlanta\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seattle\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Boston\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Los Angeles\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Annualized rent is monthly contractual rent (defined as cash base rent before abatements) under existing leases as of December 31, 2016 multiplied by 12. The aggregate amount of abatements for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $16.2 million.  Operating expenses. Our operating expenses generally consist of utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, property management fees, insurance and site maintenance costs, as well as rental expenses on our ground and building leases. In particular, our buildings require significant power to support the data center operations contained in them. Many of our leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for all or a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us. However, we generally are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses, other than utility expense, and real estate taxes under our leases for Turn-Key Flex\u00ae facilities. We also incur general and administrative expenses, including expenses relating to our asset management function, as well as significant legal, accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance, SEC reporting and compliance with the various provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct. Increases or decreases in such operating expenses will impact our overall performance. We expect to incur additional operating expenses as we continue to expand.\nClimate change legislation. In June 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives approved comprehensive clean energy and climate change legislation intended to cut greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions, via a cap-and-trade program. The U.S. Senate did not subsequently pass similar legislation. New climate change legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate in 2013, but significant opposition to federal climate change legislation exists.\nIn the absence of comprehensive federal climate change legislation, over the past several years, regulatory agencies, primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and states took the lead in regulating GHG emissions in the U.S. Under the Obama administration, EPA moved aggressively to regulate GHG emissions from automobiles and large stationary sources, including electricity producers, using its own authority under the Clean Air Act. The Trump administration has signaled that it intends to eliminate or modify certain of the EPA's GHG emissions regulations and refocus EPA's mission away from such regulation.\nThe EPA made an endangerment finding in 2009 that allows it to create regulations imposing emissions reporting, permitting, control technology installation, and monitoring requirements applicable to certain emitters of GHGs, including facilities that provide electricity to our data centers, although the materiality of the impacts will not be fully known until all regulations are finalized and legal challenges are resolved. Under the Obama administration, the EPA finalized rules imposing permitting and control technology requirements upon certain newly-constructed or modified facilities which emit GHGs under the Clean Air Act New Source Review Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or NSR PSD, and Title V permitting programs. As a result, newly-issued NSR PSD and Title V permits for new or modified electricity generating units (EGUs) and other facilities may need to address GHG emissions, including by requiring the installation of Best Available Control Technology.\u201d The EPA implemented in December 2015 the Clean Power Plan\u201d regulating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from new and existing coal-fired and natural gas EGUs. Existing EGUs are subject to statewide CO2 emissions reduction targets, an effort designed to achieve a thirty-two percent reduction in nationwide existing EGU CO2 emissions by 2030 (in comparison to 2005 levels). New, modified, and reconstructed EGUs are subject to New Source Performance Standards\u201d that include both technological requirements and numeric emission limits. However, twenty-four states and a number of industry groups challenged the Clean Power Plan in federal court, and in February 2016 the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the Clean Power Plan until the legal challenges have been decided. Further, President Trump has voiced opposition to the Clean Power Plan, and he could seek to eliminate it. Separately, the EPA's GHG reporting rule\u201d requires that certain emitters, including electricity generators, monitor and report GHG emissions. The Trump administration may seek to revise or reverse these regulations.\nAs a result, states may drive near-term regulation to reduce GHG emissions in the United States. At the state level, California implemented a GHG cap-and-trade program that began imposing compliance obligations on industrial sectors, including electricity generators and importers, in January 2013. In September 2016, California adopted legislation calling for a further reduction in GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.\nOutside the United States, the European Union, or EU (including the United Kingdom), has been operating since 2005 under a cap-and-trade program, which directly affects the largest emitters of GHGs, including electricity producers from whom we purchase power, and the EU has taken a number of other climate change-related initiatives, including a directive targeted at improving energy efficiency (which introduces energy efficiency auditing requirements). The Paris Agreement, which was adopted by the United States and 194 other countries and looks to prevent global average temperatures from increasing by more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels officially went into force on November 4, 2016. However, President Trump has signaled that he may withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. National legislation may also be implemented independently by members of the EU. For example, in the United Kingdom, the implementation of the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme introduced a mandatory reporting and pricing scheme that is designed to incentivize energy efficiency and cut emissions by large energy users. It is not yet clear how Brexit will impact the United Kingdom's (or the EU's) approach to climate change regulation. In Canada, the first compliance period under Ontario's GHG cap-and-trade program began in January 2017. Climate change regulations are in various stages of implementation in other nations as well, including nations where we operate, such as Australia, where a GHG emissions cap was implemented in 2016.\nThe cost of electric power comprises a significant component of our operating expenses. Any additional taxation or regulation of energy use, including as a result of (i) new legislation that Congress may pass, (ii) the regulations that the EPA has proposed or finalized, (iii) regulations under legislation that states have passed or may pass, or (iv) any further legislation or regulations in the EU or other regions where we operate could significantly increase our costs, and we may not be able to effectively pass all of these costs on to our tenants. These matters could adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nInterest rates. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.1 billion of variable rate debt subject to interest rate swap agreements on certain tranches of our unsecured term loan, along with $210.1 million and $364.3 million of variable rate debt that was outstanding on the 2016 global revolving credit facility and the unswapped portion of the 2016 unsecured term loan, respectively. The availability of debt and equity capital may decrease or be on unfavorable terms as a result of the circumstances described above under Global market and economic conditions\u201d or other factors. The effects on commercial real estate mortgages, if available, include, but may not be limited to: higher loan spreads, tightened loan covenants, reduced loan-to-value ratios resulting in lower borrower proceeds and higher principal payments. Potential future increases in interest rates and credit spreads may increase our interest expense and fixed charges and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, potentially impacting our future access to the debt and equity capital markets. Increased interest rates may also increase the risk that the counterparties to our swap agreements will default on their obligations, which could further increase our interest expense. If we cannot obtain capital from third party sources, we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist, satisfy our debt service obligations or pay the cash dividends to Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s stockholders necessary to maintain its qualification as a REIT.\nDemand for data center space. Our portfolio of properties consists primarily of data centers. A decrease in the demand for, or increase in supply of, data center space, Internet gateway facilities or other technology-related real estate would have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition than if we owned a portfolio with a more diversified tenant base or less specialized use. We have invested in building out additional inventory primarily in what we anticipate will be our active major metropolitan areas prior to having executed leases with respect to this space. We believe that demand in key metropolitan areas such as Northern Virginia, Dallas and Chicago is largely in line with supply. We also continue to see strong demand in other key metropolitan areas across our portfolio. However, until this inventory is leased up, which will depend on a number of factors, including available data center space in these metropolitan areas, our return on invested capital is negatively impacted. Our development activities make us particularly susceptible to general economic slowdowns, including recessions and the other circumstances described above under Global market and economic conditions,\u201d as well as adverse developments in the data center, Internet and data communications and broader technology industries. Any such slowdown or adverse development could lead to reduced corporate IT spending or reduced demand for data center space. Reduced demand could also result from business relocations, including to metropolitan areas that we do not currently serve. Changes in industry practice or in technology, such as virtualization technology, more efficient computing or networking devices, or devices that require higher power densities than today's devices, could also reduce demand for the physical data center space we provide or make the tenant improvements in our facilities obsolete or in need of significant upgrades to remain viable. In addition, the development of new technologies, the adoption of new industry standards or other factors could render many of our tenants' current products and services obsolete or unmarketable and contribute to a downturn in their businesses, thereby increasing the likelihood that they default under their leases, become insolvent or file for bankruptcy. In addition, demand for data center space in our properties, or the rates at which we lease space, may be adversely impacted either across our portfolio or in specific metropolitan areas as a result of an increase in the number of competitors, or the amount of space being offered in our metropolitan areas and other metropolitan areas by our competitors.\nTelx and European Portfolio Acquisitions. We believe that the acquisitions of Telx and the European Portfolio will provide a number of strategic and financial benefits, including providing us a leading colocation and interconnection platform, a premium connectivity infrastructure and enhanced growth potential in attractive locations. However, there can be no assurance that we will realize the intended benefits of the Telx Acquisition and the European Portfolio Acquisition and they may divert management's attention, and disrupt our plans and operations. In addition, we may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities related to Telx and the European Portfolio for which we may have no or limited recourse against the sellers.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in Item 8, Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We describe below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. Our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date on the front cover of this report.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nAcquisition of real estate. The price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors including the condition of the property and improvements, the occupancy of the building, the term and rate of in-place leases, the creditworthiness of the tenants, favorable or unfavorable financing, above- or below-market ground leases and numerous other factors.\nAccordingly, we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the identifiable assets including intangibles and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair value of such assets and liabilities. This includes determining the value of the property and improvements, land, ground leases, if any, and tenant improvements. Additionally, we evaluate the value of in-place leases on occupancy and market rent, the value of the tenant relationships, the value (or negative value) of above- (or below-) market leases, any debt or deferred taxes assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us and any building leases assumed from the seller. Each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations. For example, if we were to allocate more value to land, there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount. If we were to allocate more value to the property as opposed to allocating to the value of in-place tenant leases, this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time. This potential effect occurs because the amounts allocated to property are depreciated over the estimated lives of the property whereas amounts allocated to in-place tenant leases are amortized over the estimated term (including renewal and extension assumptions) of the leases. Additionally, the amortization of the value (or negative value) assigned to above- (or below-) market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in-place tenant leases and tenant relationships, which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated income statements.\nFrom time to time, we will receive offers for sale of our properties, either solicited or unsolicited. For those offers that are accepted, the prospective buyer will usually require a due diligence period before consummation of the transaction. It is not unusual for matters to arise that result in the withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this process. We classify real estate as held for sale\u201d when all criteria under the GAAP guidance have been met.\nCapitalization of costs. Direct and indirect project costs that are clearly associated with the development of properties are capitalized as incurred. Project costs include all costs directly associated with the development of a property, including construction costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, legal fees and costs of personnel working on the project. Indirect costs that do not clearly relate to the projects under development are not capitalized and are charged to expense as incurred.\nCapitalization of costs begins when the activities necessary to get the development project ready for its intended use begin, which include costs incurred before the beginning of construction. Capitalization of costs ceases when the development project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Determining when a development project commences and when it is substantially complete and ready for its intended use involves a degree of judgment. We generally consider a development project to be substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy. If and when development of a property is suspended pursuant to a formal change in the planned use of the property, we will evaluate whether the accumulated costs exceed the estimated value of the project and write off the amount of any such excess accumulated costs. For a development project that is suspended for reasons other than a formal change in the planned use of such property, the accumulated project costs are evaluated for impairment consistent with our impairment policies for long-lived assets. Capitalized costs are allocated to the specific components of a project that are benefited.\nUseful lives of assets. We are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate. These assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate such investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.\nAsset impairment evaluation. We review each of our properties for indicators that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of the property, a change in the expected holding period for the property, a significant adverse change in how the property is being used or expected to be used based on the underwriting at the time of acquisition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development of the property, or a history of operating or cash flow losses of the property. When such impairment indicators exist, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows (excluding interest charges) expected to result from the real estate investment's use and eventual disposition and compare that estimate to the carrying value of the property. We consider factors such as future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If our future undiscounted net cash flow evaluation indicates that we are unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. These losses have a direct impact on our net income because recording an\nimpairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether the carrying value of a property is recoverable, our strategy of holding properties over the long-term directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable and therefore requiring the recording of an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that the asset fails the recoverability test, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value.\nWe generally estimate the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues, expenses and capital improvement costs that a market participant would use based on the highest and best use of the asset, which is similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers. In certain cases, we may supplement this analysis by obtaining outside broker opinions of value.\nRevenue Recognition\nRental revenue is recognized using the straight-line method over the terms of the tenant leases. Deferred rents included in our consolidated balance sheets represent the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized to date on a straight-line basis versus the contractual rental payments under the terms of the leases. Many of our leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us. However, we generally are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses, other than utility expense, and real estate taxes under our leases for Turn-Key Flex\u00ae facilities. Such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred. Lease termination fees are recognized over the remaining term of the lease, effective as of the date the lease modification is finalized, assuming collection is not considered doubtful. As discussed above, we recognize amortization of the value of acquired above- or below-market tenant leases as a reduction of rental revenue in the case of above-market leases or an increase to rental revenue in the case of below-market leases.\nWe must make subjective estimates as to when our revenue is earned and the collectability of our accounts receivable related to minimum rent, deferred rent, expense reimbursements, lease termination fees and other income. We specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, tenant concentrations, tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts. These estimates have a direct impact on our net revenue because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net revenue, and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net revenue for a particular period.\nShare-Based Awards\nWe recognize compensation expense related to share-based awards. We generally amortize this compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. The calculation of the fair value of share-based awards is subjective and requires several assumptions over such items as expected stock volatility, dividend payments and future company results. These assumptions have a direct impact on our net income because a higher share-based awards amount would result in lower net income for a particular period.\nResults of Operations\nThe discussion below relates to our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
