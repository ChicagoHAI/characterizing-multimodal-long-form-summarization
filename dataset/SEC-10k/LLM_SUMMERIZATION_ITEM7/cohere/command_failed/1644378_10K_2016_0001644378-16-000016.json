Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW (dollar amounts in thousands)\nRMR Inc. was incorporated in Maryland on May 28, 2015 in contemplation of the Up-C Transaction. For more information about the Up-C Transaction, please see Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRMR Inc. is a holding company; substantially all of its business is conducted by RMR LLC. RMR Inc. has no employees, and the personnel and various services it requires to operate are provided by RMR LLC. As of September 30, 2016, the over 1,400 properties which RMR LLC manages are located in 48 states, Washington, DC, Puerto Rico and Canada and they are principally owned by the Managed REITs.\nThe consolidated financial information in this section include accounts of RMR Inc. or its predecessors, and periods presented in these statements prior to the Up-C Transaction are presented as if our predecessor entities, which were not then owned by a single entity, were wholly owned within a single legal entity.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are derived from providing business and property management services to our Client Companies. We also earn revenue from advisory and other services to RIF, a registered investment company, private funds and separately managed accounts.\nManaged REITs\nThe base business management fees we earn from the Managed REITs are principally based upon the lower of (i) the historical cost of each REIT's properties or (ii) each REIT's total market capitalization. The property management fees we earn from the Managed REITs are principally based upon the gross rents collected at certain managed properties owned by the REITs, excluding rents or other revenues from hotels, travel centers, senior living properties and wellness centers. The following table presents for each Managed REIT: a summary of its primary strategy and the lesser of the historical cost of its assets under management or its total market capitalization as of September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, as applicable:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Historical Cost of Assets Under Management or\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Market Capitalization\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primary Strategy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GOV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Office buildings majority leased to government tenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,071,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,959,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,000,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HPT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Hotels and travel centers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,330,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,452,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,386,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SIR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lands and properties primarily leased to single tenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,743,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,068,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,954,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SNH\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Healthcare, senior living and medical office buildings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,142,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,226,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,497,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,287,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,707,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,838,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBase business management fees payable to us by the Managed REITs are calculated monthly based upon the lesser of the average historical cost of each Managed REIT's assets under management or its average total market capitalization, as calculated in accordance with the applicable business management agreement, for each month. A Managed REIT's historical cost of assets under management includes the real estate it owns and its consolidated assets invested directly or indirectly in equity interests in or loans secured by real estate and personal property owned in connection with such real estate (including acquisition related costs which may be allocated to intangibles or are unallocated), all before reserves for depreciation, amortization, impairment charges or bad debts or other similar non-cash reserves. A Managed REIT's historical cost of assets under management does not include the cost of shares it owns of another Client Company. A Managed REIT's average total market capitalization includes the average value of the Managed REIT's outstanding common equity value during the period, plus the daily weighted average of each of the aggregate liquidation preference of preferred shares and the principal amount of consolidated indebtedness. As of September 30, 2016 the market capitalization was lower than the historical costs of assets under management for HPT. As of September 30, 2016, the historical cost of assets under management for HPT was $9,142,998. For each of the other Managed REITs, its average historical costs of assets under management were lower than market capitalization as of September 30, 2016.\nThe revenues we earned from the Managed REITs for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are set forth in the following tables:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

business management revenues and property management revenues, including construction supervision fees, if any, earned during the applicable period and excludes reimbursable payroll and related costs. Incentive business management fees from the Managed REITs are contingent performance based fees which are only recognized when earned at the end of each respective measurement period. We earned $62,263 of incentive business management fees from HPT for the calendar year ending on December 31, 2015. We record incentive business management fee revenue only when earned, which is determined at the end of the measurement period specified by the applicable business management agreement. The next measurement period under our business management agreement with each Managed REIT ends on December 31, 2016. We estimate that we would have earned aggregate incentive business management fees from one of the Managed REITs in the amount of $75,030 as of September 30, 2016 if that date had been the end of the next measurement period; however, there can be no assurance that we will in fact earn an incentive fee from that Managed REIT when measured as of December 31, 2016, the end of the next measurement period. As a result, this estimated amount of incentive business management fees, which would have been earned if the measurement period ended on September 30, 2016, is not included in the fees listed in the tables above or in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report as it may not reflect the incentive business management fees which will be earned as of the end of the measurement period, if any.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Managed Operators, AIC and ABP Trust\nIn addition to the business and property management services we provide to the Managed REITs, we provide business management services to the Managed Operators. Five Star operates senior living and healthcare facilities throughout the United States, many of which are owned by and leased from, or managed for, SNH. Sonesta manages and franchises hotels, resorts and cruise ships in the United States, Latin America, the Caribbean and the Middle East; some of Sonesta's U.S.\nhotels are owned by HPT. TA operates travel centers along the U.S. interstate highway system, many of which are owned by and leased from HPT, as well as convenience stores, gas stations and restaurants. In addition, we provide management services to certain other businesses, including ABP Trust and AIC. Generally our fees earned from business management services to companies other than the Managed REITs are based on a percentage of certain revenues of the managed businesses. We also earn fees based upon rents collected for managing rental properties owned by ABP Trust and for managing TA's headquarters building. Our revenues from services to the Managed Operators, AIC and ABP Trust were as follows (1):\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Five Star\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sonesta\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AIC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ABP Trust\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________________________________________________\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes business management fees and property management fees, including construction supervision fees, if any, earned during the applicable period and excludes reimbursable payroll and related costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> RMR Advisors and Tremont Advisors\nRMR Advisors provides advisory services to RIF, a registered closed end investment company, and earns fees based upon the fair market value of the gross assets owned by RIF, including assets acquired with the use of debt or other leverage. The value of RIF's assets, as defined by the investment advisory agreement, managed by RMR Advisors was $281,526, $246,935 and $247,250 at September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The advisory fees earned by RMR Advisors included in our revenue were $2,370, $2,380 and $2,244 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOn August 5, 2016, we acquired the Tremont business, which specializes in commercial real estate finance, principally providing capital to commercial real estate owners and developers and serving as an advisor to private funds and separately managed accounts that principally make commercial real estate debt investments. As part of this transaction, our wholly owned subsidiary, Tremont Advisors, an investment advisor registered with the SEC, was assigned the investment management contracts with investment advisory clients of the Tremont business. The Tremont business provides investment advisory services to, and may act as transaction originator for, its clients. We earned management services revenue of $54 and advisory services revenue of $250 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from these services.\nEQC\nEQC is a publicly traded REIT that primarily owns office properties. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we earned management fees from EQC under a business management agreement and a property management agreement with EQC, which had terms similar to our agreements with the Managed REITs, except that the EQC agreements were for one year terms. RMR LLC and EQC entered into a Termination and Cooperation Agreement that terminated their business and property management agreements on September 30, 2014. RMR LLC provided certain transition services to EQC through February 28, 2015, and thereafter certain additional services for EQC in Australia until October 31, 2015. Fees earned pursuant to these agreements totaled $58, $6,280, and $81,632 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nRMR Intl\nRMR Intl is a wholly owned subsidiary of RMR LLC whose sole business is holding the equity interests of RMR Australia, a company founded in 2012 to manage certain investments of a company then managed by RMR LLC in Australia. RMR Australia continues to hold an Australian financial services license granted by the Australian Securities & Investments Commission yet has ceased operations subsequent to the termination of services being provided to EQC as of October 31, 2015.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nThe continuation and growth of our business depends upon our ability to operate the Managed REITs so as to maintain and increase the value of their businesses and to assist our Managed Operators to grow their businesses. Our business and the businesses of our Client Companies generally follow the business cycle of the U.S. real estate industry, but with certain property type and regional geographic variations. As the general U.S. economy expands, commercial real estate occupancies increase and new real estate development occurs; new development frequently leads to increased real estate supply and reduced occupancies; and then the cycle repeats. These general trends can be impacted by property type characteristics or regional factors; for example, demographic factors such as the aging U.S. population or net in migration or out migration in different geographic regions can slow, accelerate, overwhelm or otherwise impact general cyclical trends. Because of such multiple factors, we believe it is often possible to grow real estate based businesses in selected property types or geographic areas despite general national trends. We also believe that these regional or special factors can be reinforced or sometimes overwhelmed by general economic factors; for example, the expectation that U.S. interest rates may soon increase appears to be causing a general decrease in the value of securities of real estate businesses, including those real estate businesses that use large amounts of debt and that attract equity investors by paying dividends such as REITs. We try to take account of industry and general economic factors as well as specific property and regional geographic considerations when providing services to our Client Companies.\nAt present we believe that the current low interest rates available for real estate purchase financing may be causing real estate valuations to exceed replacement cost for some properties in some markets and property acquisitions should be undertaken on a selective basis. We also believe that because of the diversity of properties which our Client Companies own and operate there should be opportunities for growth in selected property types and locations and that we and our Client Companies should maintain financial flexibility using only reasonable amounts of debt so we and they will be able to take advantage of growth opportunities which come to our and their attention.\nPlease see elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \"Warning Concerning Forward Looking Statements\", Part 1, Item 1 \"Business\" and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d for discussion of some of the circumstances that may adversely affect our performance and the performance of our Client Companies.\nAcquisitions\nOn August 5, 2016, RMR LLC acquired the Tremont business, a business that principally raises debt and equity for owners of commercial real estate and serves as a manager of private funds and separately managed accounts invested in commercial real estate, for total consideration of $2,466, excluding transaction costs. We believe that the Tremont business represents a new platform that may provide a growth opportunity and diversification of our operations, as the commercial real estate finance business represents an appropriate extension of our existing operations.\nThe sellers of the Tremont business, pursuant to our asset purchase agreement with them, also have the right to receive an earn out\u201d over the two year period ending August 5, 2018, based on payments that we receive from a specified part of the historical Tremont business. We have recorded estimated contingent consideration of $1,270 for this earn out.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in thousands)\nWhen considering the financial data for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, readers should note that RMR Inc. began conducting business on June 5, 2015 and did not become a publicly owned company until December 14, 2015 when the Managed REITs distributed approximately half of our Class A Common Shares to their shareholders. Prior to June 5, 2015 and December 14, 2015 our assets, structure and operations differed in several respects from those subsequent to these dates, and such differences impact the period to period comparisons.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2016, Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015\nThe following table presents the changes in our operating results for the fiscal year ended

to the comparison of consolidated results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.\nManagement services revenue. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we earned business and property management services revenue from the following sources:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Source\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed REITs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>199,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed Operators\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Client Companies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(188\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EQC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,222\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement services revenue increased $64,334 primarily due to a $62,263 annual incentive business management fee earned on December 31, 2015, an increase of $7,829 in base business management fees at the Managed REITs\nassociated primarily with growth in the market capitalization of SIR and SNH, and an increase of $5,926 in property management fees due to increases in the number of properties to which we provide property management services. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the $9,416 in other asset amortization recorded in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,999 in other asset amortization recorded in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 and the termination of our services to EQC. Other asset amortization results from the Up-C Transaction discussed in Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReimbursable payroll and related costs revenue. Reimbursable payroll and related costs revenue primarily includes amounts reimbursed to us by the Managed REITs for certain property related employee compensation and benefits expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business in our capacity as property manager, at cost. A significant portion of these reimbursable payroll and related costs arises from services we provide that are paid or reimbursed to the Managed REITs by their tenants. Reimbursable payroll and related costs revenue for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 includes recognition of non-cash share based compensation granted to some of our employees by certain of our Client Companies of $7,997 and $5,931, respectively. Reimbursable payroll and related costs revenue increased $9,430 due primarily to increases in value of share grants to some of our employees by certain of our Client Companies, increases in the number of properties we manage for the Managed REITs since October 1, 2014, and the related increase in the number of employees since that date and their associated compensation and benefits as well as regular increases in employee compensation and benefits for which we receive reimbursement.\nAdvisory services revenue. Advisory services revenue includes the fees RMR Advisors earns for managing RIF as well as the advisory services revenue the Tremont business earns from its clients. These fees increased by $240, primarily due to $250 of revenue earned by the Tremont business subsequent to our August 2016 acquisition.\nCompensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits consist of employee salaries and other employment related costs, including health insurance expenses, contributions related to our employee retirement plan, and in fiscal 2016, the value of vested shares granted to certain of our employees under our 2016 Omnibus Equity Plan. Compensation and benefits expense for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 includes $7,997 and $5,931, respectively, of non-cash share based compensation granted to some of our employees by certain of our Client Companies. Compensation and benefits expense increased $8,529 primarily due to increases in value of share grants to some of our employees by certain of our Client Companies, compensation expenses related to Class A Common Shares we awarded to certain of our officers and employees in fiscal year 2016, increased staffing as a result of increases in the number of properties we manage for the Managed REITs and the business growth of certain of our Managed Operators since October 1, 2014, as well as annual employee salary increases. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in our corporate office staffing due to the wind down of our business management and property management services to EQC in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.\nSeparation costs. Separation costs consists of employment termination costs.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of office related expenses, information technology related expenses, employee training, travel, professional services expenses and other administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased $1,406 primarily due to $5,454 of transaction related costs associated with the Up-C Transaction in fiscal year 2015, compared to $1,966 of transaction and acquisition related costs in fiscal year 2016. These decreases were partially offset by increases in recurring costs related to our becoming a publicly traded company in fiscal year 2016, as well as increases in property management expenses related to the increase in the number of properties we manage for the Managed REITs since October 1, 2014.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $349 primarily as a result of certain equipment and capitalized software becoming fully depreciated subsequent to October 1, 2015, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets related to our 2016 Tremont business acquisition.\nInterest and other income. Interest and other income decreased $1,498 primarily due to the loss of dividend income derived in fiscal year 2015 from common shares of the Managed REITs that were transferred to ABP Trust prior to Up-C Transaction.\nUnrealized losses attributable to changes in fair value of stock accounted for under the fair value option. Unrealized losses attributable to changes in fair value of stock accounted for under the fair value option in fiscal year 2015 consists of net unrealized losses on the common shares of the Managed REITs we owned before the Up-C Transaction based on changes in quoted market prices between the beginning and end of the applicable period. Prior to the Up-C Transaction, RMR LLC transferred all the Managed REITs shares it owned to ABP Trust.\nIncome tax expense. The change in income tax expense is primarily attributable to RMR Inc. becoming a corporation as part of the Up-C Transaction and thus subject to U.S. federal and state income tax with respect to RMR Inc.'s allocable share of any taxable income of RMR LLC for all of fiscal year 2016 compared with only the period June 5, 2015 to September 30, 2015 for the prior fiscal year.\nEquity in earnings of investee. Equity in earnings of investee represents our proportionate share of earnings from our prior investment in AIC for fiscal year 2015. Prior to the Up-C Transaction, RMR LLC transferred its ownership interest in AIC to ABP Trust.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the portion of consolidated net income that is attributable to ABP Trust after the Up-C Transaction. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for fiscal year 2016 includes $26,611 of the annual incentive business management fee allocated solely to ABP Trust after the Up-C Transaction discussed in Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015, Compared to

Reimbursable payroll and related costs revenue decreased $35,819 due primarily to a decrease in the number of property management personnel after our property management services to EQC ended on September 30, 2014. Reimbursable payroll and related costs revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 also includes non-cash share based payments made by certain of our Client Companies and EQC to our employees of $5,931 and $11,444, respectively, including the accelerated vesting of certain EQC share grants in March 2014.\nAdvisory services revenue. Advisory services revenue increased by $136 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 because of the increase in the average value of RIF's assets between these periods.\nCompensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expense for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 includes $5,931 and $11,444, respectively, of non-cash share based compensation granted to some of our employees by certain of our Client Companies and EQC. Compensation and benefits expense decreased $44,385 primarily due to a decrease in the number of property management personnel after our property management services to EQC ended on September 30, 2014 and a decrease in the value of certain shares granted to our employees by certain of our Client Companies and EQC, partially offset by the accelerated vesting of certain EQC share grants in March 2014.\nMembers profit sharing. Members profit sharing was historically determined based on federal income tax concepts, including our historical cash method of accounting for tax purposes. The amount is separately stated for fiscal year 2014 because of its significance and because they are no longer to be paid after the Up-C Transaction.\nSeparation costs. Separation costs consists of costs related to one time employee termination payments incurred as part of the termination of our business management and property management agreements with EQC.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses for fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 includes $5,454 of transaction related costs associated with the Up-C Transaction in 2015, partially offset by costs related to information technology and process improvement initiatives implemented during 2014, as well as lower costs incurred for travel, temporary staffing and other costs as a result of the termination of our management agreements with EQC effective September 30, 2014.\nDepreciation expense. Depreciation expense decreased $329 as a result of certain equipment and capitalized software additions becoming fully depreciated subsequent to October 1, 2013 and the disposal, at book value, of $1,335 of property and equipment in 2015.\nInterest and other income. Interest and other income increased $1,235 primarily due to increased dividends received from the Managed REITs and EQC on common shares of the Managed REITs and EQC we owned, as well as interest on a larger amount of investable cash we had during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 when compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014.\nUnrealized losses attributable to changes in fair value of stock accounted for under the fair value option. Unrealized losses attributable to changes in fair value of stock accounted for under the fair value option consists of unrealized gains or losses on our common shares of the Managed REITs based on changes in quoted market prices between the periods presented. Prior to the Up-C transaction RMR LLC transferred all the Managed REITs shares it owned to ABP Trust.\nIncome tax expense. For periods prior to the Up-C Transaction, income tax expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 primarily represents taxes incurred in Australia on income earned by the Australian subsidiary of RMR Intl, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 when our Australian operations did not generate taxable income. Income tax expense in 2015 is primarily attributable to RMR Inc. becoming a corporation as part of the Up-C Transaction and thus subject to U.S. federal and state income tax with respect to RMR Inc.'s allocable share of any taxable income of RMR LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nEquity in earnings of investee. Equity in earnings of investee represents our proportionate share of earnings from our investment in AIC for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, and the change represents the decrease in AIC's profits in fiscal year 2015 compared to 2014.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)\nWe regularly monitor our liquidity position, including cash and cash equivalents, working capital, outstanding commitments and other liquidity sources and requirements. Cash and cash equivalents include all short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and also have original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. We currently intend to use cash and cash equivalents to fund our working capital needs, to pay the regular quarterly cash dividend and to fund possible new business ventures.\nOur current assets have historically been comprised predominantly of cash, cash equivalents and receivables for business management and property management and advisory services fees. We have historically paid a significant portion of employee compensation as annual cash bonuses during the last quarter of our fiscal year. Therefore, our cash balances generally have been at their lowest near the end of our fiscal year fourth quarter after cash bonuses were paid to our\nemployees. Our cash balances then typically increase over the remainder of the next fiscal year. Our current liabilities have historically included accounts payable, accrued expenses and deposits, including accrued employee compensation.\nAs of September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $65,833 and $34,497, respectively, of which $6,012 and $206, respectively, was held by RMR Inc., with the remainder being held at RMR LLC. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, $57,741 and $33,241, respectively, of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in money market funds. The increase in cash and cash equivalents principally reflects cash generated from operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, including RMR LLC's portion of the calendar year 2015 incentive business management fee that it received in January 2016.\nOur liquidity is highly dependent upon our receipt of fees from the businesses that we manage. Historically we have funded our working capital needs with cash generated from our operating activities, and we currently do not maintain any credit facilities under which borrowings are available to us. We expect that our future working capital needs will relate largely to our operating expenses, primarily consisting of employee compensation and benefits costs, our obligation to make quarterly tax distributions to the members of RMR LLC, our obligation to make payments to ABP Trust under the Tax Receivable Agreement, our plan to make quarterly distributions on our Class A Common Shares and Class B-1 Common Shares and our plan to pay quarterly distributions to the members of RMR LLC in connection with the quarterly dividend to RMR Inc. shareholders. Our management fees are typically payable to us within 30 days of the end of each month or, in the case of annual incentive business management fees, within 30 days following each calendar year end as specified in our management agreements. Historically, we have not experienced losses on collection of our fees and have not recorded any allowances for bad debts.\nWe believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating needs and commitments for the next 12 months and for the reasonably foreseeable future. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we paid cash distributions to the holders of our Class A Common Shares and Class B-1 Common Shares aggregating $17,209. These dividends were funded by distributions from RMR LLC to holders of its membership units aggregating $33,338, of which $17,209 was distributed to us based on our aggregate ownership membership units of RMR LLC and $16,129 was distributed to ABP Trust based on its ownership of membership units of RMR LLC. See Note 7, Shareholders' Equity, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding these distributions.\nOn November 17, 2016, we paid a dividend on our Class A Common Shares and Class B-1 Common Shares in the amount of $0.25 per Class A Common Share and Class B-1 Common Share, or $4,021. This dividend was paid to our shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 21, 2016. The amount of this dividend was calculated as $0.25 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. This dividend was funded by a distribution from RMR LLC to holders of its membership units in the amount of $0.25 per unit, or $7,771, of which $4,021 was distributed to us based on our aggregate ownership of 16,082,432 membership units of RMR LLC and $3,750 was distributed to ABP Trust based on its ownership of 15,000,000 membership units of RMR LLC.\nOn August 5, 2016, RMR LLC acquired the Tremont business for total consideration of $2,466, excluding transaction costs. The sellers of the Tremont business also have the right to receive an earn out\u201d over the two year period ending August 5, 2018, based on a portion of payments that RMR LLC receives from a specified part of the historical Tremont business. We funded this acquisition with cash on hand.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, pursuant to the RMR LLC Operating Agreement, RMR LLC made required quarterly tax distributions to its holders of its membership units totaling $63,095 of which $32,562 was distributed to us and $30,533 was distributed to ABP Trust, based on each membership unit holder's respective ownership percentage in RMR LLC. The $32,562 distributed to us was eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the $30,533 distributed to ABP Trust was recorded as a reduction of their noncontrolling interest. We expect to use these funds distributed to us to fund our tax liabilities and our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement described in Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCash Flows\nFiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015\nOur changes in cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable prior year period were as follows: (i) cash provided from operating activities decreased from $102,080 in fiscal year 2015 to $98,824 in\nfiscal year 2016; (ii) cash used in investing activities decreased from $42,849 in fiscal 2015 to $3,549 in fiscal year 2016; and (iii) cash used in financing activities decreased from $166,430 in fiscal 2015 to $63,962 in fiscal 2016. Exchange rate fluctuations in connection with our Australian business activities resulted in a decrease of $35 and an increase of $23 in cash in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, compared to the prior fiscal year primarily reflects increased operating income generated in fiscal year 2016 primarily offset by the net effect of changes in our working capital activities between the two periods, including the collection of accounts receivable from EQC during the fiscal year 2015 period and the payment of amounts due to related parties during the fiscal year 2016. The decrease in cash used by investing activities for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 was due primarily to the acquisition of our investment in RMR LLC during the 2015 period. The decrease in cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to members' distributions to ABP Trust in 2015 period, partially offset by the issuance of our common shares in connection with the Up-C Transaction.\nFiscal year ended September 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014\nOur changes in cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 compared to the comparable prior year period were as follows: (i) cash provided by operating activities increased from $31,681 in fiscal year 2014 to $102,080 in fiscal 2015; (ii) cash used in investing activities increased from $14,960 in fiscal year 2014 to $42,849 in fiscal year 2015; and (iii) cash from financing activities changed from $110,577 of cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2014 to $166,430 of cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2015. Exchange rate fluctuations in connection with our Australian business activities resulted in a decrease of $35 and $132 in cash in fiscal years 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively.\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to the prior fiscal year primarily reflects changes in our working capital accounts in fiscal year 2015, including the collection of accounts receivable from an unrelated party (i.e., from EQC, which ceased to be a related party to us after it experienced a change of control in March 2014). The increase in cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year was due primarily to RMR Inc.'s investment in RMR LLC as part of the Up-C Transaction. The change in cash from financing activities for the fiscal year 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to our making of a distribution to ABP Trust in fiscal year 2015 as opposed to our receipt of an advance from ABP Trust in fiscal year 2014.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nWe have entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement that provides for the payment by RMR Inc. to ABP Trust of 85.0% of the amount of savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that RMR Inc. realizes as a result of (a) the increases in tax basis attributable to RMR Inc.'s dealings with ABP Trust and (b) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by it as a result of the Tax Receivable Agreement. See Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Business-Our Organizational Structure-Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of September 30, 2016, our consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability related to the Tax Receivable Agreement of $64,929, of which we expect to pay $2,900 to ABP Trust during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nMarket Risk and Credit Risk\nWe historically have not invested in derivative instruments, borrowed through issuing debt securities or transacted a significant part of our businesses in foreign currencies. As a result, we are not now subject to significant market risk related to interest rate changes, commodity price changes or credit risks; however, if any of these risks were to negatively impact our Client Companies' businesses or market capitalization, our revenues would likely decline. To the extent we change our approach on the foregoing activities, or engage in other activities, our market and credit risks could change.\nRisks Related to Cash and Short Term Investments\nOur cash and cash equivalents include short term, highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash that have original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. We invest a substantial amount of our cash in money market funds. The majority of our cash is maintained in U.S. bank accounts. Some U.S. bank account balances exceed the FDIC coverage limit. We believe our cash and short term investments are not subject to any material interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk or other market risk.\nExchange Rate Risk\nDuring the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K we were exposed to the risk that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on the reported value of our non U.S. dollar denominated or based assets and liabilities. In addition, in the 2015 period, certain reported amounts of our management and advisory revenue were affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the Australian dollar, based on which certain of our revenues were calculated, and the U.S. dollar, in which our financial statements are denominated. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the net impacts of the fluctuation of foreign currencies included in other comprehensive income on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income were income of $19 and expense of $252, respectively. We did not enter into any transactions to hedge our exposure to these foreign currency fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments or other methods. We do not believe these risks are material to us at this time, but they could become material if we significantly expand our non-U.S. dollar business activities in the future.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax receivable agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe commitment table above excludes amounts due to the sellers of the Tremont business because the ultimate amounts and timing of such amounts due are not presently known. As of September 30, 2016, a payable of $1,257 relating to the \"earn out\" of our acquisition of the Tremont business has been recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which represents our best estimate of the amount we currently expect to owe under our asset purchase agreement for the acquisition of the Tremont business.\nRelated Person Transactions\nWe have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with our Founders and certain of our Client Companies, our Founders have historical and continuing relationships with certain of our Client Companies and several of our Client Companies have material historical and ongoing relationships with other Client Companies. For example, our Founders are our controlling shareholders and hold membership units of our subsidiary, RMR LLC, through ABP Trust; our Founders serve as managing trustees of each Managed REIT and own and are directors of Sonesta; Barry M. Portnoy serves as a managing director of Five Star and TA; as of November 14, 2016, ABP Trust, which is owned by our Founders, and our Founders together owned approximately 36.8% of Five Star's outstanding common stock; we are a party to the Tax Receivable Agreement with ABP Trust; all of the executive officers of the Managed REITs and many of the executive officers of the Managed Operators are our officers and employees. As of September 30, 2016: the Managed REITs owned a majority of our outstanding Class A Common Shares; HPT is TA's principal landlord, and TA is HPT's largest tenant, operating travel center locations owned by HPT pursuant to long term leases; SNH is Five Star's principal landlord and Five Star is SNH's largest tenant and manager of senior living communities, operating senior living communities owned by SNH pursuant to long term agreements; and Sonesta manages 33 of HPT's hotels pursuant to long term management agreements. For further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, please see Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, the section captioned Business\u201d above in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our other filings with the SEC and our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, or the 2017 Proxy Statement, to be filed within 120 days after the close of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. In addition, for more information about these transactions and relationships and about the risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships, please see elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Warning Concerning Forward Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAn understanding of our accounting policies is necessary for a complete analysis of our results, financial position, liquidity and trends. The preparation of our financial statements requires our management to make certain critical accounting estimates and judgments that impact (i) the revenue recognized during the reporting periods and (ii) our principles of consolidation. These accounting estimates are based on our management's judgment. We consider them to be critical because of their significance to our financial statements and the possibility that future events may cause differences from current judgments or because the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates. We review these estimates on a periodic basis to test their reasonableness. Although actual amounts likely differ from such estimated amounts, we believe such differences are not likely to be material.\nRevenue Recognition. Our principal sources of revenue are:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>business management fees, including base and incentive business management fees; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>property management fees, including construction supervision fees and reimbursement for certain payroll and related expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We recognize revenue from business management and property management fees as earned in accordance with our management agreements. We consider the incentive business management fees earned from the REITs that we manage to be contingent performance based fees, which we recognize as revenue when earned at the end of each measurement period. We also recognize as revenue certain payroll reimbursements in our capacity as property manager, at cost, when we incur the related reimbursable payroll and related costs on behalf of our Client Companies. See the Revenue Recognition\u201d section of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies and our contractual arrangements.\nConsolidation. Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include only the accounts of the entities we control. We continually assesses whether our existing contractual rights give us the ability to direct the activities of the entities we manage that most significantly affect the results of that entity. The activities and factors we consider include, but are not limited to:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our representation on the entity's governing body;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the size of our ownership in the entities we manage compared to the size of the entity and the size of other investors' interests; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our contractual authority to make policy and strategic decisions without further approval or oversight of the entity's governing body.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on our historical assessments, we have not consolidated the entities we manage. We will reassess these conclusions if and when facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to the elements evidencing control.\nJOBS Act. We are an emerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act and are permitted to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We have elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and, as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements.\nRecent Accounting Developments. For a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am unable to identify the specific cells in the table you would like to copy.\n- Would you be able to clarify which cells you would like to copy? \n- Alternatively, if you could provide me with the cell range of the table, I would be happy to copy the data for you. \n\nUnfortunately, I cannot execute this task without further information about the table and the cells you want to copy.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW (dollar amounts in thousands)\nRMR Inc. was incorporated in Maryland on May 28, 2015 in contemplation of the Up-C Transaction. For more information about the Up-C Transaction, please see Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRMR Inc. is a holding company; substantially all of its business is conducted by RMR LLC. RMR Inc. has no employees, and the personnel and various services it requires to operate are provided by RMR LLC. As of September 30, 2016, the over 1,400 properties which RMR LLC manages are located in 48 states, Washington, DC, Puerto Rico and Canada and they are principally owned by the Managed REITs.\nThe consolidated financial information in this section include accounts of RMR Inc. or its predecessors, and periods presented in these statements prior to the Up-C Transaction are presented as if our predecessor entities, which were not then owned by a single entity, were wholly owned within a single legal entity.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are derived from providing business and property management services to our Client Companies. We also earn revenue from advisory and other services to RIF, a registered investment company, private funds and separately managed accounts.\nManaged REITs\nThe base business management fees we earn from the Managed REITs are principally based upon the lower of (i) the historical cost of each REIT's properties or (ii) each REIT's total market capitalization. The property management fees we earn from the Managed REITs are principally based upon the gross rents collected at certain managed properties owned by the REITs, excluding rents or other revenues from hotels, travel centers, senior living properties and wellness centers. The following table presents for each Managed REIT: a summary of its primary strategy and the lesser of the historical cost of its assets under management or its total market capitalization as of September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, as applicable:\n\nBase business management fees payable to us by the Managed REITs are calculated monthly based upon the lesser of the average historical cost of each Managed REIT's assets under management or its average total market capitalization, as calculated in accordance with the applicable business management agreement, for each month. A Managed REIT's historical cost of assets under management includes the real estate it owns and its consolidated assets invested directly or indirectly in equity interests in or loans secured by real estate and personal property owned in connection with such real estate (including acquisition related costs which may be allocated to intangibles or are unallocated), all before reserves for depreciation, amortization, impairment charges or bad debts or other similar non-cash reserves. A Managed REIT's historical cost of assets under management does not include the cost of shares it owns of another Client Company. A Managed REIT's average total market capitalization includes the average value of the Managed REIT's outstanding common equity value during the period, plus the daily weighted average of each of the aggregate liquidation preference of preferred shares and the principal amount of consolidated indebtedness. As of September 30, 2016 the market capitalization was lower than the historical costs of assets under management for HPT. As of September 30, 2016, the historical cost of assets under management for HPT was $9,142,998. For each of the other Managed REITs, its average historical costs of assets under management were lower than market capitalization as of September 30, 2016.\nThe revenues we earned from the Managed REITs for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are set forth in the following tables:\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Includes base and incentive business management revenues and property management revenues, including construction supervision fees, if any, earned during the applicable period and excludes reimbursable payroll and related costs. Incentive business management fees from the Managed REITs are contingent performance based fees which are only recognized when earned at the end of each respective measurement period. We earned $62,263 of incentive business management fees from HPT for the calendar year ending on December 31, 2015. We record incentive business management fee revenue only when earned, which is determined at the end of the measurement period specified by the applicable business management agreement. The next measurement period under our business management agreement with each Managed REIT ends on December 31, 2016. We estimate that we would have earned aggregate incentive business management fees from one of the Managed REITs in the amount of $75,030 as of September 30, 2016 if that date had been the end of the next measurement period; however, there can be no assurance that we will in fact earn an incentive fee from that Managed REIT when measured as of December 31, 2016, the end of the next measurement period. As a result, this estimated amount of incentive business management fees, which would have been earned if the measurement period ended on September 30, 2016, is not included in the fees listed in the tables above or in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report as it may not reflect the incentive business management fees which will be earned as of the end of the measurement period, if any.  Managed Operators, AIC and ABP Trust\nIn addition to the business and property management services we provide to the Managed REITs, we provide business management services to the Managed Operators. Five Star operates senior living and healthcare facilities throughout the United States, many of which are owned by and leased from, or managed for, SNH. Sonesta manages and franchises hotels, resorts and cruise ships in the United States, Latin America, the Caribbean and the Middle East; some of Sonesta's U.S.\nhotels are owned by HPT. TA operates travel centers along the U.S. interstate highway system, many of which are owned by and leased from HPT, as well as convenience stores, gas stations and restaurants. In addition, we provide management services to certain other businesses, including ABP Trust and AIC. Generally our fees earned from business management services to companies other than the Managed REITs are based on a percentage of certain revenues of the managed businesses. We also earn fees based upon rents collected for managing rental properties owned by ABP Trust and for managing TA's headquarters building. Our revenues from services to the Managed Operators, AIC and ABP Trust were as follows (1):\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Includes business management fees and property management fees, including construction supervision fees, if any, earned during the applicable period and excludes reimbursable payroll and related costs.  RMR Advisors and Tremont Advisors\nRMR Advisors provides advisory services to RIF, a registered closed end investment company, and earns fees based upon the fair market value of the gross assets owned by RIF, including assets acquired with the use of debt or other leverage. The value of RIF's assets, as defined by the investment advisory agreement, managed by RMR Advisors was $281,526, $246,935 and $247,250 at September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The advisory fees earned by RMR Advisors included in our revenue were $2,370, $2,380 and $2,244 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOn August 5, 2016, we acquired the Tremont business, which specializes in commercial real estate finance, principally providing capital to commercial real estate owners and developers and serving as an advisor to private funds and separately managed accounts that principally make commercial real estate debt investments. As part of this transaction, our wholly owned subsidiary, Tremont Advisors, an investment advisor registered with the SEC, was assigned the investment management contracts with investment advisory clients of the Tremont business. The Tremont business provides investment advisory services to, and may act as transaction originator for, its clients. We earned management services revenue of $54 and advisory services revenue of $250 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from these services.\nEQC\nEQC is a publicly traded REIT that primarily owns office properties. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we earned management fees from EQC under a business management agreement and a property management agreement with EQC, which had terms similar to our agreements with the Managed REITs, except that the EQC agreements were for one year terms. RMR LLC and EQC entered into a Termination and Cooperation Agreement that terminated their business and property management agreements on September 30, 2014. RMR LLC provided certain transition services to EQC through February 28, 2015, and thereafter certain additional services for EQC in Australia until October 31, 2015. Fees earned pursuant to these agreements totaled $58, $6,280, and $81,632 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nRMR Intl\nRMR Intl is a wholly owned subsidiary of RMR LLC whose sole business is holding the equity interests of RMR Australia, a company founded in 2012 to manage certain investments of a company then managed by RMR LLC in Australia. RMR Australia continues to hold an Australian financial services license granted by the Australian Securities & Investments Commission yet has ceased operations subsequent to the termination of services being provided to EQC as of October 31, 2015.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nThe continuation and growth of our business depends upon our ability to operate the Managed REITs so as to maintain and increase the value of their businesses and to assist our Managed Operators to grow their businesses. Our business and the businesses of our Client Companies generally follow the business cycle of the U.S. real estate industry, but with certain property type and regional geographic variations. As the general U.S. economy expands, commercial real estate occupancies increase and new real estate development occurs; new development frequently leads to increased real estate supply and reduced occupancies; and then the cycle repeats. These general trends can be impacted by property type characteristics or regional factors; for example, demographic factors such as the aging U.S. population or net in migration or out migration in different geographic regions can slow, accelerate, overwhelm or otherwise impact general cyclical trends. Because of such multiple factors, we believe it is often possible to grow real estate based businesses in selected property types or geographic areas despite general national trends. We also believe that these regional or special factors can be reinforced or sometimes overwhelmed by general economic factors; for example, the expectation that U.S. interest rates may soon increase appears to be causing a general decrease in the value of securities of real estate businesses, including those real estate businesses that use large amounts of debt and that attract equity investors by paying dividends such as REITs. We try to take account of industry and general economic factors as well as specific property and regional geographic considerations when providing services to our Client Companies.\nAt present we believe that the current low interest rates available for real estate purchase financing may be causing real estate valuations to exceed replacement cost for some properties in some markets and property acquisitions should be undertaken on a selective basis. We also believe that because of the diversity of properties which our Client Companies own and operate there should be opportunities for growth in selected property types and locations and that we and our Client Companies should maintain financial flexibility using only reasonable amounts of debt so we and they will be able to take advantage of growth opportunities which come to our and their attention.\nPlease see elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \"Warning Concerning Forward Looking Statements\", Part 1, Item 1 \"Business\" and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d for discussion of some of the circumstances that may adversely affect our performance and the performance of our Client Companies.\nAcquisitions\nOn August 5, 2016, RMR LLC acquired the Tremont business, a business that principally raises debt and equity for owners of commercial real estate and serves as a manager of private funds and separately managed accounts invested in commercial real estate, for total consideration of $2,466, excluding transaction costs. We believe that the Tremont business represents a new platform that may provide a growth opportunity and diversification of our operations, as the commercial real estate finance business represents an appropriate extension of our existing operations.\nThe sellers of the Tremont business, pursuant to our asset purchase agreement with them, also have the right to receive an earn out\u201d over the two year period ending August 5, 2018, based on payments that we receive from a specified part of the historical Tremont business. We have recorded estimated contingent consideration of $1,270 for this earn out.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in thousands)\nWhen considering the financial data for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, readers should note that RMR Inc. began conducting business on June 5, 2015 and did not become a publicly owned company until December 14, 2015 when the Managed REITs distributed approximately half of our Class A Common Shares to their shareholders. Prior to June 5, 2015 and December 14, 2015 our assets, structure and operations differed in several respects from those subsequent to these dates, and such differences impact the period to period comparisons.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2016, Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015\nThe following table presents the changes in our operating results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015:\n\nReferences to changes in the income and expense categories below relate to the comparison of consolidated results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.\nManagement services revenue. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we earned business and property management services revenue from the following sources:\n\nManagement services revenue increased $64,334 primarily due to a $62,263 annual incentive business management fee earned on December 31, 2015, an increase of $7,829 in base business management fees at the Managed REITs\nassociated primarily with growth in the market capitalization of SIR and SNH, and an increase of $5,926 in property management fees due to increases in the number of properties to which we provide property management services. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the $9,416 in other asset amortization recorded in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,999 in other asset amortization recorded in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 and the termination of our services to EQC. Other asset amortization results from the Up-C Transaction discussed in Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReimbursable payroll and related costs revenue. Reimbursable payroll and related costs revenue primarily includes amounts reimbursed to us by the Managed REITs for certain property related employee compensation and benefits expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business in our capacity as property manager, at cost. A significant portion of these reimbursable payroll and related costs arises from services we provide that are paid or reimbursed to the Managed REITs by their tenants. Reimbursable payroll and related costs revenue for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 includes recognition of non-cash share based compensation granted to some of our employees by certain of our Client Companies of $7,997 and $5,931, respectively. Reimbursable payroll and related costs revenue increased $9,430 due primarily to increases in value of share grants to some of our employees by certain of our Client Companies, increases in the number of properties we manage for the Managed REITs since October 1, 2014, and the related increase in the number of employees since that date and their associated compensation and benefits as well as regular increases in employee compensation and benefits for which we receive reimbursement.\nAdvisory services revenue. Advisory services revenue includes the fees RMR Advisors earns for managing RIF as well as the advisory services revenue the Tremont business earns from its clients. These fees increased by $240, primarily due to $250 of revenue earned by the Tremont business subsequent to our August 2016 acquisition.\nCompensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits consist of employee salaries and other employment related costs, including health insurance expenses, contributions related to our employee retirement plan, and in fiscal 2016, the value of vested shares granted to certain of our employees under our 2016 Omnibus Equity Plan. Compensation and benefits expense for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 includes $7,997 and $5,931, respectively, of non-cash share based compensation granted to some of our employees by certain of our Client Companies. Compensation and benefits expense increased $8,529 primarily due to increases in value of share grants to some of our employees by certain of our Client Companies, compensation expenses related to Class A Common Shares we awarded to certain of our officers and employees in fiscal year 2016, increased staffing as a result of increases in the number of properties we manage for the Managed REITs and the business growth of certain of our Managed Operators since October 1, 2014, as well as annual employee salary increases. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in our corporate office staffing due to the wind down of our business management and property management services to EQC in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.\nSeparation costs. Separation costs consists of employment termination costs.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of office related expenses, information technology related expenses, employee training, travel, professional services expenses and other administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased $1,406 primarily due to $5,454 of transaction related costs associated with the Up-C Transaction in fiscal year 2015, compared to $1,966 of transaction and acquisition related costs in fiscal year 2016. These decreases were partially offset by increases in recurring costs related to our becoming a publicly traded company in fiscal year 2016, as well as increases in property management expenses related to the increase in the number of properties we manage for the Managed REITs since October 1, 2014.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $349 primarily as a result of certain equipment and capitalized software becoming fully depreciated subsequent to October 1, 2015, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets related to our 2016 Tremont business acquisition.\nInterest and other income. Interest and other income decreased $1,498 primarily due to the loss of dividend income derived in fiscal year 2015 from common shares of the Managed REITs that were transferred to ABP Trust prior to Up-C Transaction.\nUnrealized losses attributable to changes in fair value of stock accounted for under the fair value option. Unrealized losses attributable to changes in fair value of stock accounted for under the fair value option in fiscal year 2015 consists of net unrealized losses on the common shares of the Managed REITs we owned before the Up-C Transaction based on changes in quoted market prices between the beginning and end of the applicable period. Prior to the Up-C Transaction, RMR LLC transferred all the Managed REITs shares it owned to ABP Trust.\nIncome tax expense. The change in income tax expense is primarily attributable to RMR Inc. becoming a corporation as part of the Up-C Transaction and thus subject to U.S. federal and state income tax with respect to RMR Inc.'s allocable share of any taxable income of RMR LLC for all of fiscal year 2016 compared with only the period June 5, 2015 to September 30, 2015 for the prior fiscal year.\nEquity in earnings of investee. Equity in earnings of investee represents our proportionate share of earnings from our prior investment in AIC for fiscal year 2015. Prior to the Up-C Transaction, RMR LLC transferred its ownership interest in AIC to ABP Trust.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the portion of consolidated net income that is attributable to ABP Trust after the Up-C Transaction. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for fiscal year 2016 includes $26,611 of the annual incentive business management fee allocated solely to ABP Trust after the Up-C Transaction discussed in Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015, Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2014\nThe following table presents the changes in our operating results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014:\n\nManagement services revenue. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 we earned business and property management services revenue from the following sources:\n\nManagement services revenue decreased $56,427 due to the termination of our management agreements with EQC effective September 30, 2014, partially offset by increases in revenues from the Managed REITs arising from net property acquisitions in excess of dispositions completed after October 1, 2013 and to a lesser extent as a result of increased management fees from the Managed Operators as a result of increases in the amount of the Managed Operators' revenues since October 1, 2013.\nReimbursable payroll and related costs revenue. Reimbursable payroll and related costs revenue decreased $35,819 due primarily to a decrease in the number of property management personnel after our property management services to EQC ended on September 30, 2014. Reimbursable payroll and related costs revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 also includes non-cash share based payments made by certain of our Client Companies and EQC to our employees of $5,931 and $11,444, respectively, including the accelerated vesting of certain EQC share grants in March 2014.\nAdvisory services revenue. Advisory services revenue increased by $136 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 because of the increase in the average value of RIF's assets between these periods.\nCompensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expense for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 includes $5,931 and $11,444, respectively, of non-cash share based compensation granted to some of our employees by certain of our Client Companies and EQC. Compensation and benefits expense decreased $44,385 primarily due to a decrease in the number of property management personnel after our property management services to EQC ended on September 30, 2014 and a decrease in the value of certain shares granted to our employees by certain of our Client Companies and EQC, partially offset by the accelerated vesting of certain EQC share grants in March 2014.\nMembers profit sharing. Members profit sharing was historically determined based on federal income tax concepts, including our historical cash method of accounting for tax purposes. The amount is separately stated for fiscal year 2014 because of its significance and because they are no longer to be paid after the Up-C Transaction.\nSeparation costs. Separation costs consists of costs related to one time employee termination payments incurred as part of the termination of our business management and property management agreements with EQC.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses for fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 includes $5,454 of transaction related costs associated with the Up-C Transaction in 2015, partially offset by costs related to information technology and process improvement initiatives implemented during 2014, as well as lower costs incurred for travel, temporary staffing and other costs as a result of the termination of our management agreements with EQC effective September 30, 2014.\nDepreciation expense. Depreciation expense decreased $329 as a result of certain equipment and capitalized software additions becoming fully depreciated subsequent to October 1, 2013 and the disposal, at book value, of $1,335 of property and equipment in 2015.\nInterest and other income. Interest and other income increased $1,235 primarily due to increased dividends received from the Managed REITs and EQC on common shares of the Managed REITs and EQC we owned, as well as interest on a larger amount of investable cash we had during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 when compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014.\nUnrealized losses attributable to changes in fair value of stock accounted for under the fair value option. Unrealized losses attributable to changes in fair value of stock accounted for under the fair value option consists of unrealized gains or losses on our common shares of the Managed REITs based on changes in quoted market prices between the periods presented. Prior to the Up-C transaction RMR LLC transferred all the Managed REITs shares it owned to ABP Trust.\nIncome tax expense. For periods prior to the Up-C Transaction, income tax expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 primarily represents taxes incurred in Australia on income earned by the Australian subsidiary of RMR Intl, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 when our Australian operations did not generate taxable income. Income tax expense in 2015 is primarily attributable to RMR Inc. becoming a corporation as part of the Up-C Transaction and thus subject to U.S. federal and state income tax with respect to RMR Inc.'s allocable share of any taxable income of RMR LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nEquity in earnings of investee. Equity in earnings of investee represents our proportionate share of earnings from our investment in AIC for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, and the change represents the decrease in AIC's profits in fiscal year 2015 compared to 2014.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)\nWe regularly monitor our liquidity position, including cash and cash equivalents, working capital, outstanding commitments and other liquidity sources and requirements. Cash and cash equivalents include all short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and also have original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. We currently intend to use cash and cash equivalents to fund our working capital needs, to pay the regular quarterly cash dividend and to fund possible new business ventures.\nOur current assets have historically been comprised predominantly of cash, cash equivalents and receivables for business management and property management and advisory services fees. We have historically paid a significant portion of employee compensation as annual cash bonuses during the last quarter of our fiscal year. Therefore, our cash balances generally have been at their lowest near the end of our fiscal year fourth quarter after cash bonuses were paid to our\nemployees. Our cash balances then typically increase over the remainder of the next fiscal year. Our current liabilities have historically included accounts payable, accrued expenses and deposits, including accrued employee compensation.\nAs of September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $65,833 and $34,497, respectively, of which $6,012 and $206, respectively, was held by RMR Inc., with the remainder being held at RMR LLC. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, $57,741 and $33,241, respectively, of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in money market funds. The increase in cash and cash equivalents principally reflects cash generated from operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, including RMR LLC's portion of the calendar year 2015 incentive business management fee that it received in January 2016.\nOur liquidity is highly dependent upon our receipt of fees from the businesses that we manage. Historically we have funded our working capital needs with cash generated from our operating activities, and we currently do not maintain any credit facilities under which borrowings are available to us. We expect that our future working capital needs will relate largely to our operating expenses, primarily consisting of employee compensation and benefits costs, our obligation to make quarterly tax distributions to the members of RMR LLC, our obligation to make payments to ABP Trust under the Tax Receivable Agreement, our plan to make quarterly distributions on our Class A Common Shares and Class B-1 Common Shares and our plan to pay quarterly distributions to the members of RMR LLC in connection with the quarterly dividend to RMR Inc. shareholders. Our management fees are typically payable to us within 30 days of the end of each month or, in the case of annual incentive business management fees, within 30 days following each calendar year end as specified in our management agreements. Historically, we have not experienced losses on collection of our fees and have not recorded any allowances for bad debts.\nWe believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating needs and commitments for the next 12 months and for the reasonably foreseeable future. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we paid cash distributions to the holders of our Class A Common Shares and Class B-1 Common Shares aggregating $17,209. These dividends were funded by distributions from RMR LLC to holders of its membership units aggregating $33,338, of which $17,209 was distributed to us based on our aggregate ownership membership units of RMR LLC and $16,129 was distributed to ABP Trust based on its ownership of membership units of RMR LLC. See Note 7, Shareholders' Equity, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding these distributions.\nOn November 17, 2016, we paid a dividend on our Class A Common Shares and Class B-1 Common Shares in the amount of $0.25 per Class A Common Share and Class B-1 Common Share, or $4,021. This dividend was paid to our shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 21, 2016. The amount of this dividend was calculated as $0.25 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. This dividend was funded by a distribution from RMR LLC to holders of its membership units in the amount of $0.25 per unit, or $7,771, of which $4,021 was distributed to us based on our aggregate ownership of 16,082,432 membership units of RMR LLC and $3,750 was distributed to ABP Trust based on its ownership of 15,000,000 membership units of RMR LLC.\nOn August 5, 2016, RMR LLC acquired the Tremont business for total consideration of $2,466, excluding transaction costs. The sellers of the Tremont business also have the right to receive an earn out\u201d over the two year period ending August 5, 2018, based on a portion of payments that RMR LLC receives from a specified part of the historical Tremont business. We funded this acquisition with cash on hand.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, pursuant to the RMR LLC Operating Agreement, RMR LLC made required quarterly tax distributions to its holders of its membership units totaling $63,095 of which $32,562 was distributed to us and $30,533 was distributed to ABP Trust, based on each membership unit holder's respective ownership percentage in RMR LLC. The $32,562 distributed to us was eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the $30,533 distributed to ABP Trust was recorded as a reduction of their noncontrolling interest. We expect to use these funds distributed to us to fund our tax liabilities and our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement described in Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCash Flows\nFiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015\nOur changes in cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable prior year period were as follows: (i) cash provided from operating activities decreased from $102,080 in fiscal year 2015 to $98,824 in\nfiscal year 2016; (ii) cash used in investing activities decreased from $42,849 in fiscal 2015 to $3,549 in fiscal year 2016; and (iii) cash used in financing activities decreased from $166,430 in fiscal 2015 to $63,962 in fiscal 2016. Exchange rate fluctuations in connection with our Australian business activities resulted in a decrease of $35 and an increase of $23 in cash in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, compared to the prior fiscal year primarily reflects increased operating income generated in fiscal year 2016 primarily offset by the net effect of changes in our working capital activities between the two periods, including the collection of accounts receivable from EQC during the fiscal year 2015 period and the payment of amounts due to related parties during the fiscal year 2016. The decrease in cash used by investing activities for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 was due primarily to the acquisition of our investment in RMR LLC during the 2015 period. The decrease in cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to members' distributions to ABP Trust in 2015 period, partially offset by the issuance of our common shares in connection with the Up-C Transaction.\nFiscal year ended September 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014\nOur changes in cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 compared to the comparable prior year period were as follows: (i) cash provided by operating activities increased from $31,681 in fiscal year 2014 to $102,080 in fiscal 2015; (ii) cash used in investing activities increased from $14,960 in fiscal year 2014 to $42,849 in fiscal year 2015; and (iii) cash from financing activities changed from $110,577 of cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2014 to $166,430 of cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2015. Exchange rate fluctuations in connection with our Australian business activities resulted in a decrease of $35 and $132 in cash in fiscal years 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively.\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to the prior fiscal year primarily reflects changes in our working capital accounts in fiscal year 2015, including the collection of accounts receivable from an unrelated party (i.e., from EQC, which ceased to be a related party to us after it experienced a change of control in March 2014). The increase in cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year was due primarily to RMR Inc.'s investment in RMR LLC as part of the Up-C Transaction. The change in cash from financing activities for the fiscal year 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to our making of a distribution to ABP Trust in fiscal year 2015 as opposed to our receipt of an advance from ABP Trust in fiscal year 2014.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nWe have entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement that provides for the payment by RMR Inc. to ABP Trust of 85.0% of the amount of savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that RMR Inc. realizes as a result of (a) the increases in tax basis attributable to RMR Inc.'s dealings with ABP Trust and (b) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by it as a result of the Tax Receivable Agreement. See Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Business-Our Organizational Structure-Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of September 30, 2016, our consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability related to the Tax Receivable Agreement of $64,929, of which we expect to pay $2,900 to ABP Trust during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nMarket Risk and Credit Risk\nWe historically have not invested in derivative instruments, borrowed through issuing debt securities or transacted a significant part of our businesses in foreign currencies. As a result, we are not now subject to significant market risk related to interest rate changes, commodity price changes or credit risks; however, if any of these risks were to negatively impact our Client Companies' businesses or market capitalization, our revenues would likely decline. To the extent we change our approach on the foregoing activities, or engage in other activities, our market and credit risks could change.\nRisks Related to Cash and Short Term Investments\nOur cash and cash equivalents include short term, highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash that have original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. We invest a substantial amount of our cash in money market funds. The majority of our cash is maintained in U.S. bank accounts. Some U.S. bank account balances exceed the FDIC coverage limit. We believe our cash and short term investments are not subject to any material interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk or other market risk.\nExchange Rate Risk\nDuring the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K we were exposed to the risk that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on the reported value of our non U.S. dollar denominated or based assets and liabilities. In addition, in the 2015 period, certain reported amounts of our management and advisory revenue were affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the Australian dollar, based on which certain of our revenues were calculated, and the U.S. dollar, in which our financial statements are denominated. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the net impacts of the fluctuation of foreign currencies included in other comprehensive income on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income were income of $19 and expense of $252, respectively. We did not enter into any transactions to hedge our exposure to these foreign currency fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments or other methods. We do not believe these risks are material to us at this time, but they could become material if we significantly expand our non-U.S. dollar business activities in the future.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016:\n\nThe commitment table above excludes amounts due to the sellers of the Tremont business because the ultimate amounts and timing of such amounts due are not presently known. As of September 30, 2016, a payable of $1,257 relating to the \"earn out\" of our acquisition of the Tremont business has been recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which represents our best estimate of the amount we currently expect to owe under our asset purchase agreement for the acquisition of the Tremont business.\nRelated Person Transactions\nWe have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with our Founders and certain of our Client Companies, our Founders have historical and continuing relationships with certain of our Client Companies and several of our Client Companies have material historical and ongoing relationships with other Client Companies. For example, our Founders are our controlling shareholders and hold membership units of our subsidiary, RMR LLC, through ABP Trust; our Founders serve as managing trustees of each Managed REIT and own and are directors of Sonesta; Barry M. Portnoy serves as a managing director of Five Star and TA; as of November 14, 2016, ABP Trust, which is owned by our Founders, and our Founders together owned approximately 36.8% of Five Star's outstanding common stock; we are a party to the Tax Receivable Agreement with ABP Trust; all of the executive officers of the Managed REITs and many of the executive officers of the Managed Operators are our officers and employees. As of September 30, 2016: the Managed REITs owned a majority of our outstanding Class A Common Shares; HPT is TA's principal landlord, and TA is HPT's largest tenant, operating travel center locations owned by HPT pursuant to long term leases; SNH is Five Star's principal landlord and Five Star is SNH's largest tenant and manager of senior living communities, operating senior living communities owned by SNH pursuant to long term agreements; and Sonesta manages 33 of HPT's hotels pursuant to long term management agreements. For further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, please see Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, the section captioned Business\u201d above in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our other filings with the SEC and our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, or the 2017 Proxy Statement, to be filed within 120 days after the close of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. In addition, for more information about these transactions and relationships and about the risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships, please see elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Warning Concerning Forward Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAn understanding of our accounting policies is necessary for a complete analysis of our results, financial position, liquidity and trends. The preparation of our financial statements requires our management to make certain critical accounting estimates and judgments that impact (i) the revenue recognized during the reporting periods and (ii) our principles of consolidation. These accounting estimates are based on our management's judgment. We consider them to be critical because of their significance to our financial statements and the possibility that future events may cause differences from current judgments or because the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates. We review these estimates on a periodic basis to test their reasonableness. Although actual amounts likely differ from such estimated amounts, we believe such differences are not likely to be material.\nRevenue Recognition. Our principal sources of revenue are:\n \u2022 business management fees, including base and incentive business management fees; and \n \u2022 property management fees, including construction supervision fees and reimbursement for certain payroll and related expenses.  We recognize revenue from business management and property management fees as earned in accordance with our management agreements. We consider the incentive business management fees earned from the REITs that we manage to be contingent performance based fees, which we recognize as revenue when earned at the end of each measurement period. We also recognize as revenue certain payroll reimbursements in our capacity as property manager, at cost, when we incur the related reimbursable payroll and related costs on behalf of our Client Companies. See the Revenue Recognition\u201d section of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies and our contractual arrangements.\nConsolidation. Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include only the accounts of the entities we control. We continually assesses whether our existing contractual rights give us the ability to direct the activities of the entities we manage that most significantly affect the results of that entity. The activities and factors we consider include, but are not limited to:\n \u2022 our representation on the entity's governing body; \n \u2022 the size of our ownership in the entities we manage compared to the size of the entity and the size of other investors' interests; and \n \u2022 our contractual authority to make policy and strategic decisions without further approval or oversight of the entity's governing body. \nBased on our historical assessments, we have not consolidated the entities we manage. We will reassess these conclusions if and when facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to the elements evidencing control.\nJOBS Act. We are an emerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act and are permitted to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We have elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and, as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements.\nRecent Accounting Developments. For a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW (dollar amounts in thousands)\nRMR Inc. was incorporated in Maryland on May 28, 2015 in contemplation of the Up-C Transaction. For more information about the Up-C Transaction, please see Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRMR Inc. is a holding company; substantially all of its business is conducted by RMR LLC. RMR Inc. has no employees, and the personnel and various services it requires to operate are provided by RMR LLC. As of September 30, 2016, the over 1,400 properties which RMR LLC manages are located in 48 states, Washington, DC, Puerto Rico and Canada and they are principally owned by the Managed REITs.\nThe consolidated financial information in this section include accounts of RMR Inc. or its predecessors, and periods presented in these statements prior to the Up-C Transaction are presented as if our predecessor entities, which were not then owned by a single entity, were wholly owned within a single legal entity.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are derived from providing business and property management services to our Client Companies. We also earn revenue from advisory and other services to RIF, a registered investment company, private funds and separately managed accounts.\nManaged REITs\nThe base business management fees we earn from the Managed REITs are principally based upon the lower of (i) the historical cost of each REIT's properties or (ii) each REIT's total market capitalization. The property management fees we earn from the Managed REITs are principally based upon the gross rents collected at certain managed properties owned by the REITs, excluding rents or other revenues from hotels, travel centers, senior living properties and wellness centers. The following table presents for each Managed REIT: a summary of its primary strategy and the lesser of the historical cost of its assets under management or its total market capitalization as of September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, as applicable:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Historical Cost of Assets Under Management or\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Market Capitalization\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primary Strategy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GOV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Office buildings majority leased to government tenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,071,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,959,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,000,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HPT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Hotels and travel centers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,330,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,452,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,386,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SIR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lands and properties primarily leased to single tenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,743,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,068,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,954,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SNH\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Healthcare, senior living and medical office buildings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,142,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,226,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,497,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,287,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,707,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,838,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBase business management fees payable to us by the Managed REITs are calculated monthly based upon the lesser of the average historical cost of each Managed REIT's assets under management or its average total market capitalization, as calculated in accordance with the applicable business management agreement, for each month. A Managed REIT's historical cost of assets under management includes the real estate it owns and its consolidated assets invested directly or indirectly in equity interests in or loans secured by real estate and personal property owned in connection with such real estate (including acquisition related costs which may be allocated to intangibles or are unallocated), all before reserves for depreciation, amortization, impairment charges or bad debts or other similar non-cash reserves. A Managed REIT's historical cost of assets under management does not include the cost of shares it owns of another Client Company. A Managed REIT's average total market capitalization includes the average value of the Managed REIT's outstanding common equity value during the period, plus the daily weighted average of each of the aggregate liquidation preference of preferred shares and the principal amount of consolidated indebtedness. As of September 30, 2016 the market capitalization was lower than the historical costs of assets under management for HPT. As of September 30, 2016, the historical cost of assets under management for HPT was $9,142,998. For each of the other Managed REITs, its average historical costs of assets under management were lower than market capitalization as of September 30, 2016.\nThe revenues we earned from the Managed REITs for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are set forth in the following tables:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

construction supervision fees, if any, earned during the applicable period and excludes reimbursable payroll and related costs. Incentive business management fees from the Managed REITs are contingent performance based fees which are only recognized when earned at the end of each respective measurement period. We earned $62,263 of incentive business management fees from HPT for the calendar year ending on December 31, 2015. We record incentive business management fee revenue only when earned, which is determined at the end of the measurement period specified by the applicable business management agreement. The next measurement period under our business management agreement with each Managed REIT ends on December 31, 2016. We estimate that we would have earned aggregate incentive business management fees from one of the Managed REITs in the amount of $75,030 as of September 30, 2016 if that date had been the end of the next measurement period; however, there can be no assurance that we will in fact earn an incentive fee from that Managed REIT when measured as of December 31, 2016, the end of the next measurement period. As a result, this estimated amount of incentive business management fees, which would have been earned if the measurement period ended on September 30, 2016, is not included in the fees listed in the tables above or in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report as it may not reflect the incentive business management fees which will be earned as of the end of the measurement period, if any.  Managed Operators, AIC and ABP Trust\nIn addition to the business and property management services we provide to the Managed REITs, we provide business management services to the Managed Operators. Five Star operates senior living and healthcare facilities throughout the United States, many of which are owned by and leased from, or managed for, SNH. Sonesta manages and franchises hotels, resorts and cruise ships in the United States, Latin America, the Caribbean and the Middle East; some of Sonesta's U.S.\nhotels are owned by HPT. TA operates travel centers along the U.S. interstate highway system, many of which are owned by and leased from HPT, as well as convenience stores, gas stations and restaurants. In addition, we provide management services to certain other businesses, including ABP Trust and AIC. Generally our fees earned from business management services to companies other than the Managed REITs are based on a percentage of certain revenues of the managed businesses. We also earn fees based upon rents collected for managing rental properties owned by ABP Trust and for managing TA's headquarters building. Our revenues from services to the Managed Operators, AIC and ABP Trust were as follows (1):\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Five Star\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sonesta\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AIC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ABP Trust\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Includes business management fees and property management fees, including construction supervision fees, if any, earned during the applicable period and excludes reimbursable payroll and related costs.  RMR Advisors and Tremont Advisors\nRMR Advisors provides advisory services to RIF, a registered closed end investment company, and earns fees based upon the fair market value of the gross assets owned by RIF, including assets acquired with the use of debt or other leverage. The value of RIF's assets, as defined by the investment advisory agreement, managed by RMR Advisors was $281,526, $246,935 and $247,250 at September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The advisory fees earned by RMR Advisors included in our revenue were $2,370, $2,380 and $2,244 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOn August 5, 2016, we acquired the Tremont business, which specializes in commercial real estate finance, principally providing capital to commercial real estate owners and developers and serving as an advisor to private funds and separately managed accounts that principally make commercial real estate debt investments. As part of this transaction, our wholly owned subsidiary, Tremont Advisors, an investment advisor registered with the SEC, was assigned the investment management contracts with investment advisory clients of the Tremont business. The Tremont business provides investment advisory services to, and may act as transaction originator for, its clients. We earned management services revenue of $54 and advisory services revenue of $250 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from these services.\nEQC\nEQC is a publicly traded REIT that primarily owns office properties. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we earned management fees from EQC under a business management agreement and a property management agreement with EQC, which had terms similar to our agreements with the Managed REITs, except that the EQC agreements were for one year terms. RMR LLC and EQC entered into a Termination and Cooperation Agreement that terminated their business and property management agreements on September 30, 2014. RMR LLC provided certain transition services to EQC through February 28, 2015, and thereafter certain additional services for EQC in Australia until October 31, 2015. Fees earned pursuant to these agreements totaled $58, $6,280, and $81,632 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nRMR Intl\nRMR Intl is a wholly owned subsidiary of RMR LLC whose sole business is holding the equity interests of RMR Australia, a company founded in 2012 to manage certain investments of a company then managed by RMR LLC in Australia. RMR Australia continues to hold an Australian financial services license granted by the Australian Securities & Investments Commission yet has ceased operations subsequent to the termination of services being provided to EQC as of October 31, 2015.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nThe continuation and growth of our business depends upon our ability to operate the Managed REITs so as to maintain and increase the value of their businesses and to assist our Managed Operators to grow their businesses. Our business and the businesses of our Client Companies generally follow the business cycle of the U.S. real estate industry, but with certain property type and regional geographic variations. As the general U.S. economy expands, commercial real estate occupancies increase and new real estate development occurs; new development frequently leads to increased real estate supply and reduced occupancies; and then the cycle repeats. These general trends can be impacted by property type characteristics or regional factors; for example, demographic factors such as the aging U.S. population or net in migration or out migration in different geographic regions can slow, accelerate, overwhelm or otherwise impact general cyclical trends. Because of such multiple factors, we believe it is often possible to grow real estate based businesses in selected property types or geographic areas despite general national trends. We also believe that these regional or special factors can be reinforced or sometimes overwhelmed by general economic factors; for example, the expectation that U.S. interest rates may soon increase appears to be causing a general decrease in the value of securities of real estate businesses, including those real estate businesses that use large amounts of debt and that attract equity investors by paying dividends such as REITs. We try to take account of industry and general economic factors as well as specific property and regional geographic considerations when providing services to our Client Companies.\nAt present we believe that the current low interest rates available for real estate purchase financing may be causing real estate valuations to exceed replacement cost for some properties in some markets and property acquisitions should be undertaken on a selective basis. We also believe that because of the diversity of properties which our Client Companies own and operate there should be opportunities for growth in selected property types and locations and that we and our Client Companies should maintain financial flexibility using only reasonable amounts of debt so we and they will be able to take advantage of growth opportunities which come to our and their attention.\nPlease see elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \"Warning Concerning Forward Looking Statements\", Part 1, Item 1 \"Business\" and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d for discussion of some of the circumstances that may adversely affect our performance and the performance of our Client Companies.\nAcquisitions\nOn August 5, 2016, RMR LLC acquired the Tremont business, a business that principally raises debt and equity for owners of commercial real estate and serves as a manager of private funds and separately managed accounts invested in commercial real estate, for total consideration of $2,466, excluding transaction costs. We believe that the Tremont business represents a new platform that may provide a growth opportunity and diversification of our operations, as the commercial real estate finance business represents an appropriate extension of our existing operations.\nThe sellers of the Tremont business, pursuant to our asset purchase agreement with them, also have the right to receive an earn out\u201d over the two year period ending August 5, 2018, based on payments that we receive from a specified part of the historical Tremont business. We have recorded estimated contingent consideration of $1,270 for this earn out.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in thousands)\nWhen considering the financial data for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, readers should note that RMR Inc. began conducting business on June 5, 2015 and did not become a publicly owned company until December 14, 2015 when the Managed REITs distributed approximately half of our Class A Common Shares to their shareholders. Prior to June 5, 2015 and December 14, 2015 our assets, structure and operations differed in several respects from those subsequent to these dates, and such differences impact the period to period comparisons.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2016, Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015\nThe following table presents the changes in our operating results for the fiscal year ended

For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we earned business and property management services revenue from the following sources:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Source\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed REITs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>199,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed Operators\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Client Companies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(188\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EQC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,222\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement services revenue increased $64,334 primarily due to a $62,263 annual incentive business management fee earned on December 31, 2015, an increase of $7,829 in base business management fees at the Managed REITs\nassociated primarily with growth in the market capitalization of SIR and SNH, and an increase of $5,926 in property management fees due to increases in the number of properties to which we provide property management services. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the $9,416 in other asset amortization recorded in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,999 in other asset amortization recorded in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 and the termination of our services to EQC. Other asset amortization results from the Up-C Transaction discussed in Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReimbursable payroll and related costs revenue. Reimbursable payroll and related costs revenue primarily includes amounts reimbursed to us by the Managed REITs for certain property related employee compensation and benefits expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business in our capacity as property manager, at cost. A significant portion of these reimbursable payroll and related costs arises from services we provide that are paid or reimbursed to the Managed REITs by their tenants. Reimbursable payroll and related costs revenue for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 includes recognition of non-cash share based compensation granted to some of our employees by certain of our Client Companies of $7,997 and $5,931, respectively. Reimbursable payroll and related costs revenue increased $9,430 due primarily to increases in value of share grants to some of our employees by certain of our Client Companies, increases in the number of properties we manage for the Managed REITs since October 1, 2014, and the related increase in the number of employees since that date and their associated compensation and benefits as well as regular increases in employee compensation and benefits for which we receive reimbursement.\nAdvisory services revenue. Advisory services revenue includes the fees RMR Advisors earns for managing RIF as well as the advisory services revenue the Tremont business earns from its clients. These fees increased by $240, primarily due to $250 of revenue earned by the Tremont business subsequent to our August 2016 acquisition.\nCompensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits consist of employee salaries and other employment related costs, including health insurance expenses, contributions related to our employee retirement plan, and in fiscal 2016, the value of vested shares granted to certain of our employees under our 2016 Omnibus Equity Plan. Compensation and benefits expense for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 includes $7,997 and $5,931, respectively, of non-cash share based compensation granted to some of our employees by certain of our Client Companies. Compensation and benefits expense increased $8,529 primarily due to increases in value of share grants to some of our employees by certain of our Client Companies, compensation expenses related to Class A Common Shares we awarded to certain of our officers and employees in fiscal year 2016, increased staffing as a result of increases in the number of properties we manage for the Managed REITs and the business growth of certain of our Managed Operators since October 1, 2014, as well as annual employee salary increases. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in our corporate office staffing due to the wind down of our business management and property management services to EQC in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.\nSeparation costs. Separation costs consists of employment termination costs.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of office related expenses, information technology related expenses, employee training, travel, professional services expenses and other administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased $1,406 primarily due to $5,454 of transaction related costs associated with the Up-C Transaction in fiscal year 2015, compared to $1,966 of transaction and acquisition related costs in fiscal year 2016. These decreases were partially offset by increases in recurring costs related to our becoming a publicly traded company in fiscal year 2016, as well as increases in property management expenses related to the increase in the number of properties we manage for the Managed REITs since October 1, 2014.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $349 primarily as a result of certain equipment and capitalized software becoming fully depreciated subsequent to October 1, 2015, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets related to our 2016 Tremont business acquisition.\nInterest and other income. Interest and other income decreased $1,498 primarily due to the loss of dividend income derived in fiscal year 2015 from common shares of the Managed REITs that were transferred to ABP Trust prior to Up-C Transaction.\nUnrealized losses attributable to changes in fair value of stock accounted for under the fair value option. Unrealized losses attributable to changes in fair value of stock accounted for under the fair value option in fiscal year 2015 consists of net unrealized losses on the common shares of the Managed REITs we owned before the Up-C Transaction based on changes in quoted market prices between the beginning and end of the applicable period. Prior to the Up-C Transaction, RMR LLC transferred all the Managed REITs shares it owned to ABP Trust.\nIncome tax expense. The change in income tax expense is primarily attributable to RMR Inc. becoming a corporation as part of the Up-C Transaction and thus subject to U.S. federal and state income tax with respect to RMR Inc.'s allocable share of any taxable income of RMR LLC for all of fiscal year 2016 compared with only the period June 5, 2015 to September 30, 2015 for the prior fiscal year.\nEquity in earnings of investee. Equity in earnings of investee represents our proportionate share of earnings from our prior investment in AIC for fiscal year 2015. Prior to the Up-C Transaction, RMR LLC transferred its ownership interest in AIC to ABP Trust.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the portion of consolidated net income that is attributable to ABP Trust after the Up-C Transaction. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for fiscal year 2016 includes $26,611 of the annual incentive business management fee allocated solely to ABP Trust after the Up-C Transaction discussed in Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015, Compared to

For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 we earned business and property management services revenue from the following sources:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Source\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed REITs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed Operators\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Client Companies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(235\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EQC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75,352\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>218,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(56,427\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement services revenue decreased $56,427 due to the termination of our management agreements with EQC effective September 30, 2014, partially offset by increases in revenues from the Managed REITs arising from net property acquisitions in excess of dispositions completed after October 1, 2013 and to a lesser extent as a result of increased management fees from the Managed Operators as a result of increases in the amount of the Managed Operators' revenues since October 1, 2013.\nReimbursable payroll and related costs revenue. Reimbursable payroll and related costs revenue decreased $35,819 due primarily to a decrease in the number of property management personnel after our property management services to EQC ended on September 30, 2014. Reimbursable payroll and related costs revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 also includes non-cash share based payments made by certain of our Client Companies and EQC to our employees of $5,931 and $11,444, respectively, including the accelerated vesting of certain EQC share grants in March 2014.\nAdvisory services revenue. Advisory services revenue increased by $136 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 because of the increase in the average value of RIF's assets between these periods.\nCompensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expense for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 includes $5,931 and $11,444, respectively, of non-cash share based compensation granted to some of our employees by certain of our Client Companies and EQC. Compensation and benefits expense decreased $44,385 primarily due to a decrease in the number of property management personnel after our property management services to EQC ended on September 30, 2014 and a decrease in the value of certain shares granted to our employees by certain of our Client Companies and EQC, partially offset by the accelerated vesting of certain EQC share grants in March 2014.\nMembers profit sharing. Members profit sharing was historically determined based on federal income tax concepts, including our historical cash method of accounting for tax purposes. The amount is separately stated for fiscal year 2014 because of its significance and because they are no longer to be paid after the Up-C Transaction.\nSeparation costs. Separation costs consists of costs related to one time employee termination payments incurred as part of the termination of our business management and property management agreements with EQC.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses for fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 includes $5,454 of transaction related costs associated with the Up-C Transaction in 2015, partially offset by costs related to information technology and process improvement initiatives implemented during 2014, as well as lower costs incurred for travel, temporary staffing and other costs as a result of the termination of our management agreements with EQC effective September 30, 2014.\nDepreciation expense. Depreciation expense decreased $329 as a result of certain equipment and capitalized software additions becoming fully depreciated subsequent to October 1, 2013 and the disposal, at book value, of $1,335 of property and equipment in 2015.\nInterest and other income. Interest and other income increased $1,235 primarily due to increased dividends received from the Managed REITs and EQC on common shares of the Managed REITs and EQC we owned, as well as interest on a larger amount of investable cash we had during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 when compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014.\nUnrealized losses attributable to changes in fair value of stock accounted for under the fair value option. Unrealized losses attributable to changes in fair value of stock accounted for under the fair value option consists of unrealized gains or losses on our common shares of the Managed REITs based on changes in quoted market prices between the periods presented. Prior to the Up-C transaction RMR LLC transferred all the Managed REITs shares it owned to ABP Trust.\nIncome tax expense. For periods prior to the Up-C Transaction, income tax expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 primarily represents taxes incurred in Australia on income earned by the Australian subsidiary of RMR Intl, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 when our Australian operations did not generate taxable income. Income tax expense in 2015 is primarily attributable to RMR Inc. becoming a corporation as part of the Up-C Transaction and thus subject to U.S. federal and state income tax with respect to RMR Inc.'s allocable share of any taxable income of RMR LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nEquity in earnings of investee. Equity in earnings of investee represents our proportionate share of earnings from our investment in AIC for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, and the change represents the decrease in AIC's profits in fiscal year 2015 compared to 2014.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)\nWe regularly monitor our liquidity position, including cash and cash equivalents, working capital, outstanding commitments and other liquidity sources and requirements. Cash and cash equivalents include all short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and also have original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. We currently intend to use cash and cash equivalents to fund our working capital needs, to pay the regular quarterly cash dividend and to fund possible new business ventures.\nOur current assets have historically been comprised predominantly of cash, cash equivalents and receivables for business management and property management and advisory services fees. We have historically paid a significant portion of employee compensation as annual cash bonuses during the last quarter of our fiscal year. Therefore, our cash balances generally have been at their lowest near the end of our fiscal year fourth quarter after cash bonuses were paid to our\nemployees. Our cash balances then typically increase over the remainder of the next fiscal year. Our current liabilities have historically included accounts payable, accrued expenses and deposits, including accrued employee compensation.\nAs of September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $65,833 and $34,497, respectively, of which $6,012 and $206, respectively, was held by RMR Inc., with the remainder being held at RMR LLC. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, $57,741 and $33,241, respectively, of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in money market funds. The increase in cash and cash equivalents principally reflects cash generated from operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, including RMR LLC's portion of the calendar year 2015 incentive business management fee that it received in January 2016.\nOur liquidity is highly dependent upon our receipt of fees from the businesses that we manage. Historically we have funded our working capital needs with cash generated from our operating activities, and we currently do not maintain any credit facilities under which borrowings are available to us. We expect that our future working capital needs will relate largely to our operating expenses, primarily consisting of employee compensation and benefits costs, our obligation to make quarterly tax distributions to the members of RMR LLC, our obligation to make payments to ABP Trust under the Tax Receivable Agreement, our plan to make quarterly distributions on our Class A Common Shares and Class B-1 Common Shares and our plan to pay quarterly distributions to the members of RMR LLC in connection with the quarterly dividend to RMR Inc. shareholders. Our management fees are typically payable to us within 30 days of the end of each month or, in the case of annual incentive business management fees, within 30 days following each calendar year end as specified in our management agreements. Historically, we have not experienced losses on collection of our fees and have not recorded any allowances for bad debts.\nWe believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating needs and commitments for the next 12 months and for the reasonably foreseeable future. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we paid cash distributions to the holders of our Class A Common Shares and Class B-1 Common Shares aggregating $17,209. These dividends were funded by distributions from RMR LLC to holders of its membership units aggregating $33,338, of which $17,209 was distributed to us based on our aggregate ownership membership units of RMR LLC and $16,129 was distributed to ABP Trust based on its ownership of membership units of RMR LLC. See Note 7, Shareholders' Equity, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding these distributions.\nOn November 17, 2016, we paid a dividend on our Class A Common Shares and Class B-1 Common Shares in the amount of $0.25 per Class A Common Share and Class B-1 Common Share, or $4,021. This dividend was paid to our shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 21, 2016. The amount of this dividend was calculated as $0.25 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. This dividend was funded by a distribution from RMR LLC to holders of its membership units in the amount of $0.25 per unit, or $7,771, of which $4,021 was distributed to us based on our aggregate ownership of 16,082,432 membership units of RMR LLC and $3,750 was distributed to ABP Trust based on its ownership of 15,000,000 membership units of RMR LLC.\nOn August 5, 2016, RMR LLC acquired the Tremont business for total consideration of $2,466, excluding transaction costs. The sellers of the Tremont business also have the right to receive an earn out\u201d over the two year period ending August 5, 2018, based on a portion of payments that RMR LLC receives from a specified part of the historical Tremont business. We funded this acquisition with cash on hand.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, pursuant to the RMR LLC Operating Agreement, RMR LLC made required quarterly tax distributions to its holders of its membership units totaling $63,095 of which $32,562 was distributed to us and $30,533 was distributed to ABP Trust, based on each membership unit holder's respective ownership percentage in RMR LLC. The $32,562 distributed to us was eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the $30,533 distributed to ABP Trust was recorded as a reduction of their noncontrolling interest. We expect to use these funds distributed to us to fund our tax liabilities and our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement described in Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCash Flows\nFiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015\nOur changes in cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable prior year period were as follows: (i) cash provided from operating activities decreased from $102,080 in fiscal year 2015 to $98,824 in\nfiscal year 2016; (ii) cash used in investing activities decreased from $42,849 in fiscal 2015 to $3,549 in fiscal year 2016; and (iii) cash used in financing activities decreased from $166,430 in fiscal 2015 to $63,962 in fiscal 2016. Exchange rate fluctuations in connection with our Australian business activities resulted in a decrease of $35 and an increase of $23 in cash in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, compared to the prior fiscal year primarily reflects increased operating income generated in fiscal year 2016 primarily offset by the net effect of changes in our working capital activities between the two periods, including the collection of accounts receivable from EQC during the fiscal year 2015 period and the payment of amounts due to related parties during the fiscal year 2016. The decrease in cash used by investing activities for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 was due primarily to the acquisition of our investment in RMR LLC during the 2015 period. The decrease in cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to members' distributions to ABP Trust in 2015 period, partially offset by the issuance of our common shares in connection with the Up-C Transaction.\nFiscal year ended September 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014\nOur changes in cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 compared to the comparable prior year period were as follows: (i) cash provided by operating activities increased from $31,681 in fiscal year 2014 to $102,080 in fiscal 2015; (ii) cash used in investing activities increased from $14,960 in fiscal year 2014 to $42,849 in fiscal year 2015; and (iii) cash from financing activities changed from $110,577 of cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2014 to $166,430 of cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2015. Exchange rate fluctuations in connection with our Australian business activities resulted in a decrease of $35 and $132 in cash in fiscal years 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively.\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to the prior fiscal year primarily reflects changes in our working capital accounts in fiscal year 2015, including the collection of accounts receivable from an unrelated party (i.e., from EQC, which ceased to be a related party to us after it experienced a change of control in March 2014). The increase in cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year was due primarily to RMR Inc.'s investment in RMR LLC as part of the Up-C Transaction. The change in cash from financing activities for the fiscal year 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to our making of a distribution to ABP Trust in fiscal year 2015 as opposed to our receipt of an advance from ABP Trust in fiscal year 2014.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nWe have entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement that provides for the payment by RMR Inc. to ABP Trust of 85.0% of the amount of savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that RMR Inc. realizes as a result of (a) the increases in tax basis attributable to RMR Inc.'s dealings with ABP Trust and (b) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by it as a result of the Tax Receivable Agreement. See Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Business-Our Organizational Structure-Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of September 30, 2016, our consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability related to the Tax Receivable Agreement of $64,929, of which we expect to pay $2,900 to ABP Trust during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nMarket Risk and Credit Risk\nWe historically have not invested in derivative instruments, borrowed through issuing debt securities or transacted a significant part of our businesses in foreign currencies. As a result, we are not now subject to significant market risk related to interest rate changes, commodity price changes or credit risks; however, if any of these risks were to negatively impact our Client Companies' businesses or market capitalization, our revenues would likely decline. To the extent we change our approach on the foregoing activities, or engage in other activities, our market and credit risks could change.\nRisks Related to Cash and Short Term Investments\nOur cash and cash equivalents include short term, highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash that have original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. We invest a substantial amount of our cash in money market funds. The majority of our cash is maintained in U.S. bank accounts. Some U.S. bank account balances exceed the FDIC coverage limit. We believe our cash and short term investments are not subject to any material interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk or other market risk.\nExchange Rate Risk\nDuring the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K we were exposed to the risk that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on the reported value of our non U.S. dollar denominated or based assets and liabilities. In addition, in the 2015 period, certain reported amounts of our management and advisory revenue were affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the Australian dollar, based on which certain of our revenues were calculated, and the U.S. dollar, in which our financial statements are denominated. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the net impacts of the fluctuation of foreign currencies included in other comprehensive income on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income were income of $19 and expense of $252, respectively. We did not enter into any transactions to hedge our exposure to these foreign currency fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments or other methods. We do not believe these risks are material to us at this time, but they could become material if we significantly expand our non-U.S. dollar business activities in the future.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax receivable agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe commitment table above excludes amounts due to the sellers of the Tremont business because the ultimate amounts and timing of such amounts due are not presently known. As of September 30, 2016, a payable of $1,257 relating to the \"earn out\" of our acquisition of the Tremont business has been recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which represents our best estimate of the amount we currently expect to owe under our asset purchase agreement for the acquisition of the Tremont business.\nRelated Person Transactions\nWe have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with our Founders and certain of our Client Companies, our Founders have historical and continuing relationships with certain of our Client Companies and several of our Client Companies have material historical and ongoing relationships with other Client Companies. For example, our Founders are our controlling shareholders and hold membership units of our subsidiary, RMR LLC, through ABP Trust; our Founders serve as managing trustees of each Managed REIT and own and are directors of Sonesta; Barry M. Portnoy serves as a managing director of Five Star and TA; as of November 14, 2016, ABP Trust, which is owned by our Founders, and our Founders together owned approximately 36.8% of Five Star's outstanding common stock; we are a party to the Tax Receivable Agreement with ABP Trust; all of the executive officers of the Managed REITs and many of the executive officers of the Managed Operators are our officers and employees. As of September 30, 2016: the Managed REITs owned a majority of our outstanding Class A Common Shares; HPT is TA's principal landlord, and TA is HPT's largest tenant, operating travel center locations owned by HPT pursuant to long term leases; SNH is Five Star's principal landlord and Five Star is SNH's largest tenant and manager of senior living communities, operating senior living communities owned by SNH pursuant to long term agreements; and Sonesta manages 33 of HPT's hotels pursuant to long term management agreements. For further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, please see Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, the section captioned Business\u201d above in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our other filings with the SEC and our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, or the 2017 Proxy Statement, to be filed within 120 days after the close of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. In addition, for more information about these transactions and relationships and about the risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships, please see elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Warning Concerning Forward Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAn understanding of our accounting policies is necessary for a complete analysis of our results, financial position, liquidity and trends. The preparation of our financial statements requires our management to make certain critical accounting estimates and judgments that impact (i) the revenue recognized during the reporting periods and (ii) our principles of consolidation. These accounting estimates are based on our management's judgment. We consider them to be critical because of their significance to our financial statements and the possibility that future events may cause differences from current judgments or because the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates. We review these estimates on a periodic basis to test their reasonableness. Although actual amounts likely differ from such estimated amounts, we believe such differences are not likely to be material.\nRevenue Recognition. Our principal sources of revenue are:\n \u2022 business management fees, including base and incentive business management fees; and \n \u2022 property management fees, including construction supervision fees and reimbursement for certain payroll and related expenses.  We recognize revenue from business management and property management fees as earned in accordance with our management agreements. We consider the incentive business management fees earned from the REITs that we manage to be contingent performance based fees, which we recognize as revenue when earned at the end of each measurement period. We also recognize as revenue certain payroll reimbursements in our capacity as property manager, at cost, when we incur the related reimbursable payroll and related costs on behalf of our Client Companies. See the Revenue Recognition\u201d section of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies and our contractual arrangements.\nConsolidation. Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include only the accounts of the entities we control. We continually assesses whether our existing contractual rights give us the ability to direct the activities of the entities we manage that most significantly affect the results of that entity. The activities and factors we consider include, but are not limited to:\n \u2022 our representation on the entity's governing body; \n \u2022 the size of our ownership in the entities we manage compared to the size of the entity and the size of other investors' interests; and \n \u2022 our contractual authority to make policy and strategic decisions without further approval or oversight of the entity's governing body. \nBased on our historical assessments, we have not consolidated the entities we manage. We will reassess these conclusions if and when facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to the elements evidencing control.\nJOBS Act. We are an emerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act and are permitted to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We have elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and, as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements.\nRecent Accounting Developments. For a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K."}
