This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of the factors we describe under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other risks as well as other factors that are not currently known to us, that we currently consider immaterial or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions.\nOverview\nWe are a home care services provider operating in three segments: personal care; hospice; and home health. Our services are principally provided in the home under agreements with federal, state and local government agencies. Our consumers are predominantly dual eligible,\u201d meaning they are eligible to receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits. Managed care revenues accounted for 33.9%, 33.1% and 26.1% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nA summary of our financial results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 is provided in the table below.\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amounts in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net service revenues - continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 518,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 425,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 400,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 355,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 271,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 232,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Net service revenues and net income from continuing operations, net income and total assets have been updated to reflect the correction described in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2018, we provided our services in 24 states through 156 offices. Our payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we served approximately 57,000, 51,000 and 50,000 discrete individuals, respectively. Our personal care segment also includes staffing services, with clients including assisted living facilities, nursing homes and hospice facilities.\nAcquisitions\nIn addition to our organic growth, we have grown through acquisitions that have expanded our presence in current markets or facilitated our entry into new markets where in-home care has been moving to managed care organizations.\nOn January 1, 2018, we acquired certain assets of LifeStyle Options, Inc. ( LifeStyle\u201d) in order to expand private pay services in Illinois. The total consideration for the transaction was $4.1 million, comprised of $3.3 million in cash and $0.8 million, which represented the estimated fair value of contingent consideration, subject to the achievement of certain performance targets set forth in an earn-out agreement. As of December 31, 2018, the performance targets were not met and the Company remeasured the earn-out to fair value.\nOn April 1, 2018, we completed an acquisition of certain assets of Arcadia for approximately $18.9 million. Arcadia provides home care services to approximately 2,300 consumers through 26 offices in 10 states. We funded this acquisition through the delayed draw term loan portion of our credit facility. In September 2018, we acquired certain affiliate branches of Arcadia for $0.6 million using cash on hand.\nOn May 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding stock of Ambercare for approximately $39.6 million plus the amount of excess cash held by Ambercare at closing (approximately $12.0 million). With the purchase of Ambercare, we expanded our personal care operations and acquired hospice and home health operations in the state of New Mexico. We funded this acquisition through the delayed draw term loan portion of our credit facility.\nEffective October 31, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of VIP Health Care Services for approximately $28.0 million. With the purchase of VIP Health Care Services, we will expand our personal care operations in the state of New York and into the New York City metropolitan area. We expect to complete this transaction in the second quarter of 2019,\ncontingent on the timing of certain regulatory approvals. We expect to fund this acquisition through a delayed draw term loan under our credit facility and available cash on hand.\nRevenue by Payor\nOur payor clients are principally federal, state and local governmental agencies and, increasingly, managed care organizations. The federal, state and local programs under which the agencies operate are subject to legislative, budgetary and other risks that can influence reimbursement rates. We are experiencing a transition of business from government payors to managed care organizations, which we believe aligns with our emphasis on coordinated care and the reduction of the need for acute care.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our payor revenue was:\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Personal Care\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n(in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nSegment\nNet\nService\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n(in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nSegment\nNet\nService\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n(in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nSegment\nNet\nService\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State, local and other\ngovernmental programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 286,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 273,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 282,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Managed care organizations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 173,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 140,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Private pay\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total personal care segment net\nservice revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 492,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 425,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 400,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWith the acquisition of Ambercare completed during the second quarter of 2018, we began to report our business with two additional segments, hospice and home health.

The state of Illinois did not adopt comprehensive budgets for fiscal years 2016 or 2017, ending June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2017, respectively. On July 6, 2017, the state of Illinois passed a budget for the state fiscal year 2018, which began on July 1, 2017, authorizing the Illinois Department on Aging to pay for our services rendered to non-Medicaid consumers provided in prior fiscal years. As of December 31, 2018, we have received substantially all such payments. On June 4, 2018, the state of Illinois passed a budget for state fiscal year 2019, which began in July 1, 2018.\nIn December 2014, the Chicago City Council passed an ordinance that will raise the minimum wage for Chicago workers to $13 per hour by July of 2019, with increases up to $1 per hour effective on July 1 of each year. The rate is $12 per hour effective July 1, 2018. The wage increase in 2016 did not have a material impact on our financial results because of our existing wage scale. The 2017\nwage increase was offset by a reimbursement rate increase. In the budget process for the 2019 fiscal year, a similar provision was proposed but was not included in the final budget. We believe that there is legislative support for a reimbursement rate increase and anticipate that an increase to offset the wage increase could be passed in the first half of 2019. Our financial performance will be impacted in quarters for which a reimbursement rate increase is not in effect.\nImpact of Changes in Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement\nIn April of 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d) issued a final rule, which beginning January 1, 2019, will allow Medicare Advantage insurers to offer beneficiaries more options and new benefits. Through this new rule, CMS has redefined health-related supplemental benefits to include services that increase health and improve quality of life, including coverage of non-skilled in-homecare. This policy change, emphasizing improving quality and reducing costs, aligns with our overall approach to care, and we believe the increased demand for personal care from the Medicare Advantage population represents a significant upside opportunity over the next three to five years.\nComponents of our Statements of Income\nNet Service Revenues\nWe generate net service revenues by providing our services directly to consumers and primarily on an hourly basis. We receive payment for providing such services from our payor clients, including federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private consumers. Net service revenues are principally provided based on authorized hours, determined by the relevant agency, at an hourly rate which is either contractual or fixed by legislation and are recognized at the time services are rendered.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, ( ASU 2014-09\u201d) which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach and did not record a cumulative catch-up adjustment as the timing and measurement of revenue for our customers consistent with our prior revenue recognition model. However, the majority of what historically was classified as provision for doubtful accounts under operating expenses is now treated as an implicit price concession factored into net service revenues.\nCost of Service Revenues\nWe incur direct care wages, payroll taxes and benefit-related costs in connection with providing our services. We also provide workers' compensation and general liability coverage for our employees.\nEmployees are also reimbursed for their travel time and related travel costs in certain instances.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses from continuing operations include our costs for operating our network of local agencies and our administrative offices.\nOur agency expenses from continuing operations consist of costs for supervisory personnel, our community care supervisors and office administrative costs. Personnel costs include wages, payroll taxes, and employee benefits. Facility costs including rents, utilities, and postage, telephone and office expenses. Our support centers include costs for accounting, information systems, human resources, billing and collections, contracting, marketing and executive leadership. These expenses consist of compensation, including stock-based compensation, payroll taxes, employee benefits, legal, accounting and other professional fees, travel, general insurance, rents and related facility costs.\nIn 2016, we initiated steps to streamline our operations. We incurred total expenses related to these initiatives of approximately $1.9 million, $1.7 million and $8.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The expenses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily relates to terminated employees resulting mainly from changes made to the management team during the year and other professional fees. The expenses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 included costs related to terminated employees resulting mainly from changes made to the management team made during the year, fees related to the termination of professional services relationships, other contract termination costs and asset write-offs. The expenses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016, included costs related to terminated employees resulted mainly from the closure of the contact center and other changes to the executive leadership team made during the year and other direct costs associated with implementing these initiatives including contract termination costs, accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nWe amortize our intangible assets with finite lives, consisting of customer and referral relationships, trade names, trademarks and non-compete agreements, principally using accelerated methods based upon their estimated useful lives. Depreciable assets consist principally of furniture and equipment, network administration and telephone equipment, and operating system software. Depreciable and leasehold assets are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line method over their useful lives or, if less and if applicable, their lease terms.\nProvision for Doubtful Accounts\nPrior to 2018, we established our allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent it was probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected. We established our provision for doubtful accounts primarily by reviewing the creditworthiness of significant customers and through evaluations over the collectability of the receivables. An allowance for doubtful accounts was maintained at a level that our management believed was sufficient to cover potential losses.\nIn 2018, subsequent adjustments that are determined to be the result of an adverse change in the payor's ability to pay are recognized as provision for doubtful accounts with the adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We recorded $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a reduction to revenue that would have been recorded as provision for doubtful accounts under the prior revenue recognition guidance.\nInterest Income\nIllinois law entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the statement of income caption, Interest income.\u201d For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016, we received $2.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively, in prompt payment interest. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not receive any prompt payment interest. While we may be owed additional prompt payment interest, the amount, timing, and intent to provide such payments remains uncertain, and we will continue to recognize prompt payment interest income upon satisfaction of these constraints\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income when incurred and consists of (i) interest and unused credit line fees on our credit facility, and our Terminated Senior Credit Facility (as defined under Senior Secured Credit Facility below), (ii) interest on our capital lease obligations and (iii) amortization and write-off of debt issuance costs.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income of $0.2 million consisted of income distributions received from investments in joint ventures, which were sold on October 1, 2017. We accounted for this income in accordance with ASC Topic 325, Investments-Other\u201d and recognized the net accumulated earnings only to the extent distributed by the joint ventures on the date received.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAll of our income is from domestic sources. We incur state and local taxes in states in which we operate. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our federal statutory rate was 21.0%, 35.0% and 35.0%, respectively. The effective income tax rate was 20.6%, 39.0% and 25.5% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The difference between our federal statutory and effective income tax rates are principally due to the inclusion of state taxes and the use of federal employment tax credits.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Reform Act\u201d). The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35.0% to a flat 21.0% rate, effective January 1, 2018. Our effective income tax rate increased by approximately 5.3% in 2017 due to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance as a result of the elimination of a performance-based equity exception in calculating the $1.0 million limitation for 162(m) under the Tax Reform Act.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDiscontinued operations consists of the reduction of the indemnification reserve, net of tax, for our 2013 Home Health Business that was sold effective March 1, 2013 and the results of operations for an agency in Pennsylvania that was sold on December 30, 2013.\nResults of

operating expenses, operating income from continuing operations, income tax expense, net income from continuing operations and net income have been updated to reflect the correction, as discussed in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet service revenues increased by 21.6% to $518.1 million for the year 2018 compared to $426.0 million in 2017. Net service revenues increased primarily due to the acquisitions of Arcadia and Ambercare during the second quarter of 2018 and an increase in average billable census for personal care services in 2018 as compared to 2017. This increase in net service revenues was offset by a $9.7 million decrease in net service revenues as a result of our adoption of ASC 606. Under ASC 606 the majority of what historically was classified as provision for doubtful accounts under operating expenses is now treated as an implicit price concession factored into net service revenues. See Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, decreased to 26.7% for 2018, from 27.2% in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to our adoption of ASC 606, as described above, which resulted in a $9.7 million decrease in net service revenues. This decrease was offset by the acquisition of the relatively higher margin Ambercare business in the second quarter of 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to $105.0 million as compared to $76.9 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to acquisitions that resulted in an increase in administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs of $14.3 million, an increase in acquisition expenses of $2.9 million and an increase in rent expense of $1.9 million. General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues increased to 20.3% for 2018, from 18.1% in 2017. The increase was primarily due to our adoption of ASC 606, as described above, which resulted in a $9.7 million decrease in net service revenues and an increase in administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs.\nProvision for doubtful accounts decreased by approximately $8.1 million to $0.3 million for 2018 compared to $8.4 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to our adoption of ASC 606 which resulted in a $8.0 million decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts as the majority of what historically was classified as provision for doubtful accounts under operating expenses is now treated as an implicit price concession factored into net service revenues.\nDepreciation and amortization increased to $8.6 million from $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily due to the increase of intangible assets related to the fiscal year 2018 acquisitions.\nInterest Income\nIllinois law entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the statement of income caption, Interest income.\u201d For the year ended December 31, 2018, we received $2.3 million in prompt payment interest. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not receive any prompt payment interest. While we may be owed additional prompt payment interest, the amount, timing, and intent to provide such payments remains uncertain, and we will continue to recognize prompt payment interest income upon satisfaction of these constraints.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased to $5.0 million from $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. The increases in interest expenses are primarily due to higher outstanding term loan balance under our credit facility in 2018 compared to 2017, offset by a write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs in the amount of $1.3 million upon the termination of our Terminated Senior Secured Credit Facility on May 8, 2017. See Note 10 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income of $0.2 million, consisted of income distributions received from the investments in joint ventures, which were sold on October 1, 2017. We accounted for this income in accordance with ASC Topic 325, Investments-Other\u201d and recognized the net accumulated earnings only to the extent distributed by the joint ventures on the date received.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAll of our income is from domestic sources. We incur state and local taxes in states in which we operate. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our federal statutory rate was 21.0% and 35.0%, respectively. The effective income tax rate was 20.6% and 39.0% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The difference between our federal statutory and effective income tax rates are principally due to the inclusion of state taxes and the use of federal employment tax credits.\nDiscontinued Operations\nEffective March 1, 2013, we sold substantially all of the assets used in our 2013 Home Health Business as described in Part I, Item 1. Therefore, we have segregated the 2013 Home Health Business operating results and presented them separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented, see Note 5 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe table below summarizes the results of discontinued operations.\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amounts In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (174\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (245\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNo revenues were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018 or 2017 related to the 2013 Home Health Business due to the sale of the business. For the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the earnings from discontinued operations represented our reduction of the Medicare indemnification reserve for the 2013 Home Health Business for periods no longer subject to audit. As of December 31, 2018, we have estimated no further billing adjustments for 2013 and 2012 which were previously subject to Medicare audits.\nResults of Operations - Segments\nThe following tables

31, 2017. Net service revenues increased primarily as a result of a 13.0% increase in billable hours in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increases are primarily due to the acquisitions of Arcadia and Ambercare\nduring the second quarter of 2018. In addition, net service revenues increased as a result of a 12.6% increase in billable hours and a 2.4% increase in revenues per billable hour in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. A significant amount of our net service revenues were derived from one payor client, the Illinois Department on Aging, which accounted for 31.0% and 36.5% of net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These increases in net service revenues were offset by a $9.7 million decrease in net service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of our adoption of ASC 606. Under ASC 606 the majority of what historically was classified as provision for doubtful accounts under operating expenses is now treated as an implicit price concession factored into net service revenues. See Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, decreased from 27.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 25.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to our adoption of ASC 606, as described above, which resulted in a $9.7 million decrease in net service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nProvision for doubtful accounts decreased by approximately $8.1 million to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to our adoption of ASC 606 which resulted in a $8.0 million decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts for the year ended December 31, 2017, as the majority of what historically was classified as provision for doubtful accounts under operating expenses is now treated as an implicit price concession factored into net service revenues.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by approximately $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to acquisitions that resulted in a $6.4 million increase in administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs, a $1.2 million increase in commissions, and a $0.7 million increase in rent expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nHospice Segment\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hospice Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Segment\nNet Service\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amounts in Thousands,\nExcept Percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Results\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of services revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for doubtful accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business Metrics (Actual Numbers)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Admissions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average daily census\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average length of stay\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Patient days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 128,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue per patient day\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 146.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment Revenue by Payor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Managed care organizations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment net service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment revenue by significant states\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New Mexico\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment net service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the second quarter of 2018, with the completion of the acquisition of Ambercare, we began operating a hospice segment.

Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet service revenues from state, local and other governmental programs accounted for 64.2% and 70.5% of net service revenues for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Managed care organizations accounted for 33.1% and 26.0% of net service revenues in 2017 and 2016 respectively, with private and commercial payors accounting for the remainder of net service revenues. A significant amount of our net service revenues in 2017 and 2016 were derived from one payor client, Illinois Department on Aging, which accounted for 36.5% and 42.1% respectively, of our total net service revenues.\nNet service revenues increased $25.1 million, or 6.3%, to $426.0 million for 2017 compared to $400.9 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to a 4.1% increase in average billable census and a 2.9% increase in revenues per billable hour.\nGross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, increased to 27.2% for 2017, from 26.5% in 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $3.7 million reduction in direct service costs associated with benefits, travel mileage and unemployment taxes, and our exit from the lower margin adult day services centers.\nGeneral and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues decreased to 18.1% for 2017, from 19.2% in 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in severance and restructuring costs of $6.4 million and a decrease in costs for outside consultants of $0.9 million and a decrease in telephone expenses of $0.8 million. These decreases were offset by an increase in administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs of $7.4 million and an increase in acquisition expenses of $1.0 million.\nDepreciation and amortization increased slightly to $6.7 million from $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Amortization of intangibles, which are amortized using straight-line and accelerated methods, totaled $4.7 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nInterest Income\nIllinois law entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the statement of income caption, Interest income.\u201d For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not receive any prompt payment interest. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we received $2.8 million in prompt payment interest. While we may be owed additional prompt payment interest, the amount, timing, and intent to provide such payments remains uncertain, and we will continue to recognize prompt payment interest income upon satisfaction of these constraints.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased to $4.5 million from $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs in the amount of $1.3 million upon the termination of our Terminated Senior Secured Credit Facility on May 8, 2017, as well as increased interest expense due to the higher outstanding term loan balance under our credit facility. See Note 10 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, other income of $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, consisted of income distributions received from the investments in joint ventures, which were sold on October 1, 2017. We accounted for this income in accordance with ASC Topic 325, Investments-Other\u201d and recognized the net accumulated earnings only to the extent distributed by the joint ventures on the date received.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAll of our income is from domestic sources. We incur state and local taxes in states in which we operate. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our federal statutory rate was 35.0 % and 35.0%, respectively. The effective income tax rate was 39.0 % and 25.5% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The difference between our federal statutory and effective income tax rates are principally due to the inclusion of state taxes and the use of federal employment tax credits.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Reform Act\u201d). The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35.0% to a flat 21.0% rate, effective January 1, 2018. Our effective income tax rate increased by approximately 5.3% in 2017 due to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance as a result of the elimination of a performance-based equity exception in calculating the $1.0 million limitation for 162(m) under the Tax Reform Act.\nDiscontinued Operations\nEffective March 1, 2013, we sold substantially all of the assets used in our 2013 Home Health Business as described in Part I, Item 1. Therefore, we have segregated the 2013 Home Health Business operating results and presented them separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented, see Note 5 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe table below summarizes the results of discontinued operations.\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amounts In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (245\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (163\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNo revenues were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 or 2016 related to the 2013 Home Health Business due to the sale of the business. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the earnings from discontinued operations represented our reduction of the Medicare indemnification reserve for the 2013 Home Health Business sold for periods no longer subject to audit.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility. During the year ending December 31, 2018, we received cash proceeds from the issuance and sale of shares of common stock of Holdings in our secondary public offering as described below under Secondary Offering\u201d. As described below under Senior Secured Credit Facility\u201d, we entered into a credit agreement on May 8, 2017 that replaced our Terminated Senior Secured Credit Facility. As described below under Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility\u201d, we amended and restated our Existing Credit Agreement on October 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had cash balances of $70.4 million and $53.8 million, respectively.\nDuring the year ending December 31, 2018, we drew a total of approximately $60.4 million on our delayed draw term loan under our credit facility to fund the acquisitions of Ambercare and Arcadia. As of December 31, 2018, the term loan was paid in full in connection with the New Credit Agreement entered into during the fourth quarter of 2018, as discussed below.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a total of $20.0 million revolving credit loans outstanding on our credit facility. After giving effect to the amount drawn on our credit facility, approximately $10.8 million of outstanding letters of credit and borrowing limits based on an advance multiple of adjusted EBITDA, we had $142.9 million available for borrowing under our credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had a total of $44.4 million outstanding on our credit facility. After giving effect to the amount drawn on our credit facility, approximately $11.8 million of outstanding letters of credit and borrowing limits based on an advance multiple of adjusted EBITDA, we had $105.1 million available for borrowing under our credit facility.\nCash flows from operating activities represent the inflow of cash from our payor clients and the outflow of cash for payroll and payroll taxes, operating expenses, interest and taxes. Due to its revenue deficiencies as well as budget and financing issues, from time to time the state of Illinois has reimbursed us on a delayed basis with respect to our various agreements including with our largest payor, the Illinois Department on Aging. The open receivable balance from the state of Illinois decreased by $13.6 million from $37.9 million as of December 31, 2017 to $24.3 million as of December 31, 2018.\nThe Illinois Department on Aging's payments for non-Medicaid consumers have been delayed in the past and may continue to be delayed in the future due to budget disputes. The state of Illinois did not adopt comprehensive budgets for fiscal years 2016 or 2017, ending June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2017, respectively. On July 6, 2017, the state of Illinois passed a budget for state fiscal year 2018, which began on July 1, 2017, authorizing the Illinois Department on Aging to pay for our services rendered to non-Medicaid consumers in prior fiscal years. As of December 31, 2018, we have received substantially all such payments. On June 4, 2018, the state of Illinois passed a budget for state fiscal year 2019, which began on July 1, 2018.\nThere remains uncertainty surrounding the state of Illinois' future year budgets. If future budgets are not enacted timely, payments from the state of Illinois could be delayed in the future. The delays could adversely impact our liquidity and result in the need to increase borrowings under our credit facility or cause us to pursue other liquidity options.\nIn December 2014, the Chicago City Council passed an ordinance that will raise the minimum wage for Chicago workers to $13 per hour by July of 2019, with increases up to $1 per hour effective on July 1 of each year. The rate is $12 per hour effective July 1, 2018. The wage increase in 2016 did not have a material impact on us because of our existing wage scale. The 2017 wage increase was offset by a reimbursement rate increase. In the budget process for the 2019 fiscal year, a similar provision was proposed but was not included in the final budget. We believe that there is legislative support for a reimbursement rate increase and anticipate that an\nincrease to offset the wage increase could be passed in the first half of 2019. Our financial performance will be impacted in quarters for which a reimbursement rate increase is not in effect.\nAmended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility\nOn October 31, 2018, we amended and restated our Existing Credit Agreement, as hereinafter defined (the New Credit Agreement,\u201d and together with the Existing Credit Agreement, our credit facility\u201d) with certain lenders and Capital One, National Association as a lender and swing line lender and as agent for all lenders. This amended and restated credit facility totals $269.6 million, inclusive of a $250.0 million revolving loan and a $19.6 million delayed draw term loan, and amends and restates our existing senior secured credit facility totaling $250.0 million. The maturity of this amended and restated credit facility is May 8, 2023, with borrowing under the delayed draw term loan available until June 30, 2019, as extended pursuant to the consent letter, dated January 30, 2019, executed by the Required Lenders (as defined in the New Credit Agreement). Interest on our amended and restated credit facility may be payable at (x) the sum of (i) an applicable margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.50% based on the applicable senior net leverage ratio plus (ii) a base rate equal to the greatest of (a) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the prime rate,\u201d (b) the sum of the federal funds rate plus a margin of 0.50% and (c) the sum of the adjusted LIBOR that would be applicable to a loan with an interest period of one month advanced on the applicable day (not to be less than 0.00%) plus a margin of 1.00% or (y) the sum of (i) an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.50% based on the applicable senior net leverage ratio plus (ii) the offered rate per annum for similar dollar deposits for the applicable interest period that appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page (not to be less than zero). Swing loans may not be LIBOR loans. The availability of additional draws under this amended and restated credit facility is conditioned, among other things, upon (after giving effect to such draws) the Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) not exceeding 3.75:1.00. In certain circumstances, in connection with a Material Acquisition (as defined in the New Credit Agreement), we can elect to increase our Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) compliance covenant to 4.25:1.00 for the then current fiscal quarter and the three succeeding fiscal quarters. In connection with this amended and restated credit facility, we incurred approximately $1.1 million of debt issuance costs.\nAddus HealthCare, Inc. ( Addus HealthCare\u201d) is the borrower, and its parent, Holdings, and substantially all of Holdings' subsidiaries are guarantors under this amended and restated credit facility, and it is secured by a first priority security interest in all of our and the other credit parties' current and future tangible and intangible assets, including the shares of stock of the borrower and subsidiaries. The New Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for credit facilities of this type, including limitations on us with respect to liens, indebtedness, guaranties, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions and dispositions of assets.\nWe pay a fee ranging from 0.20% to 0.35% based on the applicable senior net leverage ratio times the unused portion of the revolving portion of the amended and restated credit facility.\nThe New Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants regarding, among other things, the maintenance of records, compliance with laws, maintenance of permits, maintenance of insurance and property and payment of taxes. The New Credit Agreement also contains certain customary financial covenants and negative covenants that, among other things, include a requirement to maintain a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement), a requirement to stay below a maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) and a requirement to stay below a maximum permitted amount of capital expenditures, as well as restrictions on guarantees, indebtedness, liens, investments and loans, subject to customary carve outs, a restriction on dividends (provided that Addus HealthCare may make distributions to us in an amount that does not exceed $7.5 million in any year absent of an event of default, plus limited exceptions for tax and administrative distributions), a restriction on the ability to consummate acquisitions under our credit facility if we exceed certain Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) thresholds without the consent of the lenders, restrictions on mergers, dispositions of assets, and affiliate transactions, and restrictions on fundamental changes and lines of business.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we drew a total of approximately $60.4 million of delayed draw term loans under our credit facility to fund the acquisitions of Ambercare and Arcadia. As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of $20.0 million of revolving loans outstanding on our credit facility with an interest rate of 4.35%.\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nPrior to October 31, 2018, we were a party to a credit agreement (the Existing Credit Agreement\u201d) with certain lenders and Capital One, National Association, as a lender and swing lender and as agent for all lenders. This credit facility totaled $250.0 million, replaced our previous senior secured credit facility totaling $125.0 million ( Terminated Senior Secured Credit Facility\u201d), and terminated the Second Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of November 10, 2015, as modified by the May 24, 2016 amendment (as amended, the Terminated Senior Secured Credit Agreement\u201d), between us, certain lenders and Fifth Third Bank, as agent, which evidenced the Terminated Senior Secured Credit Facility. The credit facility included a $125.0 million revolving loan, a $45.0 million term loan and an $80.0 million delayed draw term loan.\nOn October 31, 2018, we repaid in full the outstanding debt balance of $102.6 million together with accrued interest of $0.5 million and amended and restated the Existing Credit Agreement.\nSecondary Offering\nOn August 20, 2018, we, together with Eos Capital Partners III, L.P. (the Selling Stockholder\u201d) completed a secondary public offering of an aggregate 2,100,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share at a purchase price per share to the public of $59.00 (the Public Offering Price\u201d). Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Underwriting Agreement, 1,075,267 shares of common stock were issued and sold by us (the Primary Shares\u201d) and 1,024,733 shares of Common Stock were sold by the Selling Stockholder (the Secondary Shares\u201d). Net proceeds of approximately $59.1 million were received by us from the sale of 1,075,267 Primary Shares. On August 22, 2018, the underwriters exercised their full over-allotment option in connection with the offering and, as a result, we issued and sold an additional 315,000 shares of common stock to the underwriters at the Public Offering Price, less the underwriting discount. The over-allotment resulted in additional net proceeds to us of approximately $17.5 million. We used the proceeds received from this offering for general corporate purposes, and to pay down the $102.6 million of our delayed term loan discussed above in connection with the amendment and restatement of our credit facility. We did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the Secondary Shares. The secondary offering resulted in an increase to additional paid in capital of approximately $76.6 million, net of issuance costs of $5.4 million, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2018.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes historical changes in our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amounts in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (743\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (67,789\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24,268\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21,738\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $52.8 million for the same period in 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the state of Illinois passed a budget on July 6, 2017, which resulted in significant receipts on accounts receivable for services previously provided. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received timely payments on receivables from the state of Illinois.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $67.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of $39.6 million for the acquisition of Ambercare, net of cash acquired of $12.0 million, $18.9 million for the acquisition of Arcadia, $3.3 million for the acquisition of LifeStyle and $3.4 million in purchases of property and equipment primarily related to investments in our technology infrastructure. Our investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of $2.6 million in proceeds from the sale of three adult day services centers, $1.1 million in proceeds from the sale of investments in joint ventures, $22.4 million for the acquisition of Options Home Care, net of cash acquired, $1.9 million for the acquisition of Sun Cities, net of cash acquired, and $3.6 million in purchases of property and equipment primarily related to new office space and investments in our technology infrastructure.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $51.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were from net proceeds from our secondary offering of $76.6 million, borrowings of $60.4 million on the delayed draw term loan portion of our credit facility to fund the acquisitions of Arcadia and Ambercare, $104.9 million of payments on our term loan portion of the credit facility, $20.0 million borrowing on the revolver, $1.0 million in payments on capital lease obligations and $1.0 in cash received from the exercise of stock options. Our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 were borrowings of $45.0 million and subsequent repayments of $0.6 million on the term loan portion of our credit facility, $30.0 million in draws and subsequent repayments on the revolver portion of our credit facility, $20.0 million in draws and subsequent repayments on the revolver portion of our Terminated Senior Secured Credit Facility, $24.1 million of payments on the term loan portion of our Terminated Senior Secured Credit Facility, $1.2 million in cash received from exercise of stock options, $2.9 million payment for debt issuance costs under our credit facility, and $1.4 million of payments on capital lease obligations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $52.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $0.7 million for the same period in 2016. This increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to\nsignificant receipts on accounts receivable from the state of Illinois for our services provided through June 30, 2017 under its budget passed on July 6, 2017.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of $2.6 million in proceeds from the sale of three adult day services centers, $1.1 million in proceeds from the sale of investments in joint ventures, $22.4 million for the acquisition of Options Home Care, net of cash acquired, $1.9 million for the acquisition of Sun Cities, net of cash acquired, and $3.6 million in purchases of property and equipment primarily related to new office space and investments in our technology infrastructure. Our investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $20.0 million for the acquisition of South Shore as described in Note 6 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and $1.7 million in purchases of property and equipment related to new office space and investments in our technology infrastructure.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 were borrowings of $45.0 million and subsequent repayments of $0.6 million on the term loan portion of our credit facility, $30.0 million in draws and subsequent repayments on the revolver portion of our credit facility, $20.0 million in draws and subsequent repayments on the revolver portion of our Terminated Senior Secured Credit Facility, $24.1 million of payments on the term loan portion of our Terminated Senior Secured Credit Facility, $1.2 million in cash received from exercise of stock options, $2.9 million payment for debt issuance costs under our credit facility, and $1.4 million of payments on capital lease obligations. Our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $52.0 million in draws on our credit facility to fund on-going operations and the acquisition of South Shore, a full repayment of the revolving portion of our credit facility in the amount of $27.0 million and $0.9 million payments on the term loan portion of our credit facility. Our financing activities also included $1.2 million of payments on capital lease obligations, $3.0 million of cash received for the exercise of employee stock options, $1.1 million of excess tax benefit from exercise of stock options, $0.5 million payment for debt issuance costs and a $0.1 million payment for the contingent earn-out obligation related to our December 1, 2013 acquisition of Coordinated Home Health Care, LLC.\nOutstanding Accounts Receivable\nGross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $108.7 million and $104.3 million, respectively. Outstanding accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, increased by $15.1 million as of December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. The increase in net accounts receivable was primarily due to accounts receivable acquired from our Arcadia and Ambercare acquisitions in the second quarter of 2018.\nIn 2017, we established our allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent it was probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected. We established our provision for doubtful accounts primarily by reviewing the creditworthiness of significant customers and through evaluations over the collectability of the receivables. An allowance for doubtful accounts was maintained at a level that our management believed was sufficient to cover potential losses.\nIn 2018, subsequent adjustments that are determined to be the result of an adverse change in the payor's ability to pay are recognized as provision for doubtful accounts with the adoption of ASC 606-10. We recorded $9.7 million as a reduction to revenue that would have been recorded as provision for doubtful accounts for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our collection procedures include review of account aging and direct contact with our payors. We have historically not used collection agencies. An uncollectible amount is written off to the allowance account after reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted.\nWe calculate our days sales outstanding ( DSO\u201d) by taking the accounts receivable outstanding net of the allowance for doubtful accounts divided by the total net service revenues for the last quarter, multiplied by the number of days in that quarter. Our DSOs were 71, 77 and 107 days at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The DSOs for our largest payor, the Illinois Department on Aging, at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 55, 75 and 152 days, respectively. We may not receive payments on a consistent basis in the near term and our DSOs and the DSO for the Illinois Department on Aging may increase despite the state of Illinois's enactment of state budget for fiscal years 2018 and 2019.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet guarantees or arrangements with unconsolidated entities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expense and related disclosures. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other sources and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances, however, actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider the items discussed below to be critical because of their impact on operations and their application requires our judgment and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach and did not record a cumulative catch-up adjustment as the timing and measurement of revenue for our customers is similar to its prior revenue recognition model. However, the majority of what historically was classified as provision for doubtful accounts under operating expenses is now treated as an implicit price concession factored into net service revenues. We recorded $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a reduction to revenue that would have been recorded as provision for doubtful accounts under the prior revenue recognition guidance.\nPersonal Care\nThe majority of our net service revenues are generated from providing personal care services directly to consumers under contracts with state, local and other governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private consumers. Generally, these contracts, which are negotiated based on current contracting practices as appropriate for the payor, establish the terms of a customer relationship and set the broad range of terms for services to be performed at a stated rate. However, the contracts do not give rise to rights and obligations until an order is placed with us. When an order is placed, it creates the performance obligation to provide a defined quantity of service hours, or authorized hours, per consumer. We satisfy our performance obligations over time, given that consumers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by us as the services are performed. As we have a right to consideration from customers commensurate with the value provided to customers from the performance completed over a given invoice period, we have elected to use the practical expedient for measuring progress toward satisfaction of performance obligations and recognizes patient service revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice.\nHospice Revenue\nWe generate net service revenues from providing hospice services to consumers who are terminally ill and as well as for families. Net service revenues are recognized as services are provided and costs for delivery of such services are incurred. The estimated payment rates are daily rates for each of the levels of care we deliver. Hospice companies are subject to two specific payment limit caps under the Medicare program each federal fiscal year, the inpatient cap and the aggregate cap. The aggregate cap limits the amount of Medicare reimbursement a hospice may receive, based on the number of Medicare patients served. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we were below the payment limits and did not record a cap liability.\nHome Health Revenue\nWe also generate net service revenues from providing home healthcare services directly to consumers mainly under contracts with Medicare and managed care organizations. Generally, these contracts, which are negotiated based on current contracting practices as appropriate for the payor, establish the terms of a relationship and set the broad range of terms for services to be performed on an episodic basis at a stated rate. Home health Medicare services are paid under the Medicare Home Health Prospective Payment System ( HHPPS\u201d), which is based on a 60-day episode of care. The HHPPS permits multiple, continuous episodes per patient. Medicare payment rates for episodes under HHPPS vary based on the severity of the patient's condition as determined by assessment of a patient's Home Health Resource Group score. We elect to use the same 60-day length of episode that Medicare recognizes as standard but accelerates revenue upon discharge to align with a patient's episode length if less than the expected 60-days, which depicts the transfer of services and related benefits received by the patient over the term of the contract necessary to satisfy the obligations. We recognize revenue based on the number of days elapsed during an episode of care within the reporting period. We satisfy our performance obligations as consumers receive and consume the benefits provided by us as the services are performed. As we have a right to consideration from Medicare commensurate with the services provided to customers from the performance completed over a given episodic period, we have elected to use the practical expedient for measuring progress toward satisfaction of performance obligations. Under this method recognizing revenue ratably over the episode based on beginning and ending dates is a reasonable proxy for the transfer of benefit of the service.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe are paid for our services primarily by federal, state and local agencies under Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, commercial insurance companies and private consumers. While our accounts receivable are uncollateralized, our credit risk is somewhat limited due to the significance of governmental payors to our results of operations. Laws and regulations governing the governmental programs in which we participate are complex and subject to interpretation. Amounts collected may be different than amounts billed due to client eligibility issues, insufficient or incomplete documentation, services at levels other than authorized and other reasons unrelated to credit risk.\nFor 2017, we established our allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent it was probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected. We established our provision for doubtful accounts primarily by reviewing the creditworthiness of significant customers and through evaluations over the collectability of the receivables. An allowance for doubtful accounts was maintained at a level that our management believed was sufficient to cover potential losses.\nIn 2018, subsequent adjustments that are determined to be the result of an adverse change in the payor's ability to pay are recognized as provision for doubtful accounts with the adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach and did not record a cumulative catch-up adjustment as the timing and measurement of revenue was consistent with its prior revenue recognition model. However, the majority of what historically was classified as provision for doubtful accounts under operating expenses is now treated as an implicit price concession factored into net service revenues. We recorded $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a reduction to revenue that would have been recorded as provision for doubtful accounts under the prior revenue recognition guidance. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $0.7 million and $10.5 million, which is included in the account receivable, net of allowances on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nGoodwill\nOur carrying value of goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired from various acquisitions. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, as of October 1, or whenever potential impairment triggers occur, such as a significant change in business climate or regulatory changes that would indicate that an impairment may have occurred. We may use a qualitative test, known as Step 0,\u201d or a two-step quantitative method to determine whether impairment has occurred. In Step 0, we can elect to perform an optional qualitative analysis and based on the results skip the two-step analysis. Additionally, it is our policy to update the fair value calculation of our reporting units and perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test on a periodic basis. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we performed the quantitative analysis to evaluate whether an impairment occurred. In 2017 and 2016, we elected to implement Step 0 and were not required to conduct the remaining two-step analysis. Based on the totality of the information available, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values were greater than the carrying values of the reporting units, and as such, no further analysis was required. We concluded that there were no impairments for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, goodwill was $135.4 million and $90.3, respectively, included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIntangible Assets\nOur identifiable intangible assets consist of customer and referral relationships, trade names, trademarks, state licenses and non-compete agreements. We use various valuation techniques to determine initial fair value of our intangible assets, including relief-from-royalty, income approach, discounted cash flow analysis, and multi-period excess earnings, which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. Under these valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, expected periods over which the assets will be utilized, appropriate discount rates and other variables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.\nAmortization is computed using straight-line and accelerated methods based upon the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which range from three to twenty-five years and assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We would recognize an impairment loss when the estimated future non-discounted cash flows associated with the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. An impairment charge would then be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. We estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the income approach. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. We test intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, as of October 1, or whenever potential impairment triggers occur, such as a significant change in business climate or regulatory changes that would indicate that an impairment may have occurred. No impairment charge was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, intangibles, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization was $23.0 million and $16.6 million, respectively, included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWorkers' Compensation Program\nOur workers' compensation insurance program has a $0.4 million deductible component. We recognize our obligations associated with this program in the period the claim is incurred. The cost of both the claims reported and claims incurred but not reported, up to the deductible, have been accrued based on historical claims experience, industry statistics and an actuarial analysis performed by an independent third party. We monitor our claims quarterly and adjust our reserves accordingly. These costs are recorded primarily as the cost of services on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded $15.2 million and $12.6 million, respectively, in accrued workers' compensation insurance. The accrued workers' compensation\ninsurance is included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded $1.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in workers' compensation insurance recovery receivables. The workers' compensation insurance recovery receivable is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInterest Income\nIllinois law entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the statement of income caption, Interest income.\u201d For the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2016, we received $2.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively, in prompt payment interest. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not receive any prompt payment interest. While we may be owed additional prompt payment interest in the future, the amount, timing and intent to provide receipt of such payments remains uncertain, and we will continue to recognize prompt payment interest income upon satisfaction of these constraints.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe account for income taxes under the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. The objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns Deferred taxes, resulting from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities, are also adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. ASC Topic 740 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. ASC Topic 740 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, ASC Topic 740 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions.\nWe recognize interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties within operating expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe currently have one stock incentive plan, the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan\u201d), under which new grants of stock-based employee compensation are made. We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation. Compensation expense is recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis under the 2017 Plan over the vesting period of the equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the options and restricted stock awards. Beginning January 1, 2017, we began utilizing the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to value our options, as we believe it is a more widely accepted and understood valuation model. Prior to January 1, 2017, we utilized the Enhanced Hull-White Trinomial Model to value our options. The determination of the fair value of stock-based payments utilizing the Black-Scholes Model and the Enhanced Hull-White Trinomial Model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected dividends yield, expected forfeiture rate, expected turn-over rate and the expected exercise multiple.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe had outstanding letters of credit of $10.8 million at December 31, 2018. These standby letters of credit benefit our third-party insurer for our high deductible workers' compensation insurance program. The amount of the letters of credit is negotiated annually in conjunction with the insurance renewals. We anticipate our commitment could increase as we continue to grow our business.\nThe following table summarizes our cash contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amounts in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving loan under the amended and\nrestated credit facility, 4.52% due 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payable on revolving loan (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> As described in Note 10 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, interest on borrowings under the revolving loan are variable.

Future inflation would have mostly negative impacts on our business. Rising price levels might allow us to increase our fees to private pay clients, but would cause our operating costs, particularly the wages we pay our caregivers, to increase. Further, our ability to realize rate increases from government programs might be limited despite inflation.\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to comprehend the

following discussion together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of the factors we describe under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other risks as well as other factors that are not currently known to us, that we currently consider immaterial or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions.\nOverview\nWe are a home care services provider operating in three segments: personal care; hospice; and home health. Our services are principally provided in the home under agreements with federal, state and local government agencies. Our consumers are predominantly dual eligible,\u201d meaning they are eligible to receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits. Managed care revenues accounted for 33.9%, 33.1% and 26.1% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nA summary of our financial results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 is provided in the table below.\n\n (1) Net service revenues and net income from continuing operations, net income and total assets have been updated to reflect the correction described in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nAs of December 31, 2018, we provided our services in 24 states through 156 offices. Our payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we served approximately 57,000, 51,000 and 50,000 discrete individuals, respectively. Our personal care segment also includes staffing services, with clients including assisted living facilities, nursing homes and hospice facilities.\nAcquisitions\nIn addition to our organic growth, we have grown through acquisitions that have expanded our presence in current markets or facilitated our entry into new markets where in-home care has been moving to managed care organizations.\nOn January 1, 2018, we acquired certain assets of LifeStyle Options, Inc. ( LifeStyle\u201d) in order to expand private pay services in Illinois. The total consideration for the transaction was $4.1 million, comprised of $3.3 million in cash and $0.8 million, which represented the estimated fair value of contingent consideration, subject to the achievement of certain performance targets set forth in an earn-out agreement. As of December 31, 2018, the performance targets were not met and the Company remeasured the earn-out to fair value.\nOn April 1, 2018, we completed an acquisition of certain assets of Arcadia for approximately $18.9 million. Arcadia provides home care services to approximately 2,300 consumers through 26 offices in 10 states. We funded this acquisition through the delayed draw term loan portion of our credit facility. In September 2018, we acquired certain affiliate branches of Arcadia for $0.6 million using cash on hand.\nOn May 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding stock of Ambercare for approximately $39.6 million plus the amount of excess cash held by Ambercare at closing (approximately $12.0 million). With the purchase of Ambercare, we expanded our personal care operations and acquired hospice and home health operations in the state of New Mexico. We funded this acquisition through the delayed draw term loan portion of our credit facility.\nEffective October 31, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of VIP Health Care Services for approximately $28.0 million. With the purchase of VIP Health Care Services, we will expand our personal care operations in the state of New York and into the New York City metropolitan area. We expect to complete this transaction in the second quarter of 2019,\ncontingent on the timing of certain regulatory approvals. We expect to fund this acquisition through a delayed draw term loan under our credit facility and available cash on hand.\nRevenue by Payor\nOur payor clients are principally federal, state and local governmental agencies and, increasingly, managed care organizations. The federal, state and local programs under which the agencies operate are subject to legislative, budgetary and other risks that can influence reimbursement rates. We are experiencing a transition of business from government payors to managed care organizations, which we believe aligns with our emphasis on coordinated care and the reduction of the need for acute care.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our payor revenue was:\n\nWith the acquisition of Ambercare completed during the second quarter of 2018, we began to report our business with two additional segments, hospice and home health. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our hospice and home health revenue was:\n\nWe derive a significant amount of our net service revenues in Illinois, which represented 47.5%, 52.6% and 53.6% of our total net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nA significant amount of our net service revenues are derived from one payor client, the Illinois Department on Aging, which accounted for 31.0%, 36.5% and 42.1% of our total net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe Illinois Department on Aging's payments for non-Medicaid consumers have been delayed in the past and may continue to be delayed in the future due to budget disputes. The state of Illinois did not adopt comprehensive budgets for fiscal years 2016 or 2017, ending June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2017, respectively. On July 6, 2017, the state of Illinois passed a budget for the state fiscal year 2018, which began on July 1, 2017, authorizing the Illinois Department on Aging to pay for our services rendered to non-Medicaid consumers provided in prior fiscal years. As of December 31, 2018, we have received substantially all such payments. On June 4, 2018, the state of Illinois passed a budget for state fiscal year 2019, which began in July 1, 2018.\nIn December 2014, the Chicago City Council passed an ordinance that will raise the minimum wage for Chicago workers to $13 per hour by July of 2019, with increases up to $1 per hour effective on July 1 of each year. The rate is $12 per hour effective July 1, 2018. The wage increase in 2016 did not have a material impact on our financial results because of our existing wage scale. The 2017\nwage increase was offset by a reimbursement rate increase. In the budget process for the 2019 fiscal year, a similar provision was proposed but was not included in the final budget. We believe that there is legislative support for a reimbursement rate increase and anticipate that an increase to offset the wage increase could be passed in the first half of 2019. Our financial performance will be impacted in quarters for which a reimbursement rate increase is not in effect.\nImpact of Changes in Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement\nIn April of 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d) issued a final rule, which beginning January 1, 2019, will allow Medicare Advantage insurers to offer beneficiaries more options and new benefits. Through this new rule, CMS has redefined health-related supplemental benefits to include services that increase health and improve quality of life, including coverage of non-skilled in-homecare. This policy change, emphasizing improving quality and reducing costs, aligns with our overall approach to care, and we believe the increased demand for personal care from the Medicare Advantage population represents a significant upside opportunity over the next three to five years.\nComponents of our Statements of Income\nNet Service Revenues\nWe generate net service revenues by providing our services directly to consumers and primarily on an hourly basis. We receive payment for providing such services from our payor clients, including federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private consumers. Net service revenues are principally provided based on authorized hours, determined by the relevant agency, at an hourly rate which is either contractual or fixed by legislation and are recognized at the time services are rendered.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, ( ASU 2014-09\u201d) which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach and did not record a cumulative catch-up adjustment as the timing and measurement of revenue for our customers consistent with our prior revenue recognition model. However, the majority of what historically was classified as provision for doubtful accounts under operating expenses is now treated as an implicit price concession factored into net service revenues.\nCost of Service Revenues\nWe incur direct care wages, payroll taxes and benefit-related costs in connection with providing our services. We also provide workers' compensation and general liability coverage for our employees.\nEmployees are also reimbursed for their travel time and related travel costs in certain instances.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses from continuing operations include our costs for operating our network of local agencies and our administrative offices.\nOur agency expenses from continuing operations consist of costs for supervisory personnel, our community care supervisors and office administrative costs. Personnel costs include wages, payroll taxes, and employee benefits. Facility costs including rents, utilities, and postage, telephone and office expenses. Our support centers include costs for accounting, information systems, human resources, billing and collections, contracting, marketing and executive leadership. These expenses consist of compensation, including stock-based compensation, payroll taxes, employee benefits, legal, accounting and other professional fees, travel, general insurance, rents and related facility costs.\nIn 2016, we initiated steps to streamline our operations. We incurred total expenses related to these initiatives of approximately $1.9 million, $1.7 million and $8.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The expenses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily relates to terminated employees resulting mainly from changes made to the management team during the year and other professional fees. The expenses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 included costs related to terminated employees resulting mainly from changes made to the management team made during the year, fees related to the termination of professional services relationships, other contract termination costs and asset write-offs. The expenses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016, included costs related to terminated employees resulted mainly from the closure of the contact center and other changes to the executive leadership team made during the year and other direct costs associated with implementing these initiatives including contract termination costs, accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nWe amortize our intangible assets with finite lives, consisting of customer and referral relationships, trade names, trademarks and non-compete agreements, principally using accelerated methods based upon their estimated useful lives. Depreciable assets consist principally of furniture and equipment, network administration and telephone equipment, and operating system software. Depreciable and leasehold assets are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line method over their useful lives or, if less and if applicable, their lease terms.\nProvision for Doubtful Accounts\nPrior to 2018, we established our allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent it was probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected. We established our provision for doubtful accounts primarily by reviewing the creditworthiness of significant customers and through evaluations over the collectability of the receivables. An allowance for doubtful accounts was maintained at a level that our management believed was sufficient to cover potential losses.\nIn 2018, subsequent adjustments that are determined to be the result of an adverse change in the payor's ability to pay are recognized as provision for doubtful accounts with the adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We recorded $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a reduction to revenue that would have been recorded as provision for doubtful accounts under the prior revenue recognition guidance.\nInterest Income\nIllinois law entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the statement of income caption, Interest income.\u201d For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016, we received $2.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively, in prompt payment interest. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not receive any prompt payment interest. While we may be owed additional prompt payment interest, the amount, timing, and intent to provide such payments remains uncertain, and we will continue to recognize prompt payment interest income upon satisfaction of these constraints\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income when incurred and consists of (i) interest and unused credit line fees on our credit facility, and our Terminated Senior Credit Facility (as defined under Senior Secured Credit Facility below), (ii) interest on our capital lease obligations and (iii) amortization and write-off of debt issuance costs.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income of $0.2 million consisted of income distributions received from investments in joint ventures, which were sold on October 1, 2017. We accounted for this income in accordance with ASC Topic 325, Investments-Other\u201d and recognized the net accumulated earnings only to the extent distributed by the joint ventures on the date received.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAll of our income is from domestic sources. We incur state and local taxes in states in which we operate. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our federal statutory rate was 21.0%, 35.0% and 35.0%, respectively. The effective income tax rate was 20.6%, 39.0% and 25.5% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The difference between our federal statutory and effective income tax rates are principally due to the inclusion of state taxes and the use of federal employment tax credits.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Reform Act\u201d). The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35.0% to a flat 21.0% rate, effective January 1, 2018. Our effective income tax rate increased by approximately 5.3% in 2017 due to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance as a result of the elimination of a performance-based equity exception in calculating the $1.0 million limitation for 162(m) under the Tax Reform Act.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDiscontinued operations consists of the reduction of the indemnification reserve, net of tax, for our 2013 Home Health Business that was sold effective March 1, 2013 and the results of operations for an agency in Pennsylvania that was sold on December 30, 2013.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our consolidated results of operations.\n\n (1) For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenue, gross profit, provision for doubtful accounts, operating expenses, operating income from continuing operations, income tax expense, net income from continuing operations and net income have been updated to reflect the correction, as discussed in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nNet service revenues increased by 21.6% to $518.1 million for the year 2018 compared to $426.0 million in 2017. Net service revenues increased primarily due to the acquisitions of Arcadia and Ambercare during the second quarter of 2018 and an increase in average billable census for personal care services in 2018 as compared to 2017. This increase in net service revenues was offset by a $9.7 million decrease in net service revenues as a result of our adoption of ASC 606. Under ASC 606 the majority of what historically was classified as provision for doubtful accounts under operating expenses is now treated as an implicit price concession factored into net service revenues. See Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, decreased to 26.7% for 2018, from 27.2% in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to our adoption of ASC 606, as described above, which resulted in a $9.7 million decrease in net service revenues. This decrease was offset by the acquisition of the relatively higher margin Ambercare business in the second quarter of 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to $105.0 million as compared to $76.9 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to acquisitions that resulted in an increase in administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs of $14.3 million, an increase in acquisition expenses of $2.9 million and an increase in rent expense of $1.9 million. General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues increased to 20.3% for 2018, from 18.1% in 2017. The increase was primarily due to our adoption of ASC 606, as described above, which resulted in a $9.7 million decrease in net service revenues and an increase in administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs.\nProvision for doubtful accounts decreased by approximately $8.1 million to $0.3 million for 2018 compared to $8.4 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to our adoption of ASC 606 which resulted in a $8.0 million decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts as the majority of what historically was classified as provision for doubtful accounts under operating expenses is now treated as an implicit price concession factored into net service revenues.\nDepreciation and amortization increased to $8.6 million from $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily due to the increase of intangible assets related to the fiscal year 2018 acquisitions.\nInterest Income\nIllinois law entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the statement of income caption, Interest income.\u201d For the year ended December 31, 2018, we received $2.3 million in prompt payment interest. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not receive any prompt payment interest. While we may be owed additional prompt payment interest, the amount, timing, and intent to provide such payments remains uncertain, and we will continue to recognize prompt payment interest income upon satisfaction of these constraints.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased to $5.0 million from $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. The increases in interest expenses are primarily due to higher outstanding term loan balance under our credit facility in 2018 compared to 2017, offset by a write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs in the amount of $1.3 million upon the termination of our Terminated Senior Secured Credit Facility on May 8, 2017. See Note 10 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income of $0.2 million, consisted of income distributions received from the investments in joint ventures, which were sold on October 1, 2017. We accounted for this income in accordance with ASC Topic 325, Investments-Other\u201d and recognized the net accumulated earnings only to the extent distributed by the joint ventures on the date received.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAll of our income is from domestic sources. We incur state and local taxes in states in which we operate. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our federal statutory rate was 21.0% and 35.0%, respectively. The effective income tax rate was 20.6% and 39.0% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The difference between our federal statutory and effective income tax rates are principally due to the inclusion of state taxes and the use of federal employment tax credits.\nDiscontinued Operations\nEffective March 1, 2013, we sold substantially all of the assets used in our 2013 Home Health Business as described in Part I, Item 1. Therefore, we have segregated the 2013 Home Health Business operating results and presented them separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented, see Note 5 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe table below summarizes the results of discontinued operations.\n\nNo revenues were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018 or 2017 related to the 2013 Home Health Business due to the sale of the business. For the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the earnings from discontinued operations represented our reduction of the Medicare indemnification reserve for the 2013 Home Health Business for periods no longer subject to audit. As of December 31, 2018, we have estimated no further billing adjustments for 2013 and 2012 which were previously subject to Medicare audits.\nResults of Operations - Segments\nThe following tables and related analysis summarize our operating results and business metrics by segment:\nPersonal Care Segment\n\n (1) Average billable census is the number of unique clients receiving a billable service during the year. \n (2) Billable hours is the total number of hours served to clients during a year. \n (3) For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenue, gross profit, provision for doubtful accounts, operating expenses, operating income from continuing operations, income tax expense, net income from continuing operations and net income have been updated to reflect the correction, as discussed in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nNet service revenues increased by 15.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Net service revenues increased primarily as a result of a 13.0% increase in billable hours in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increases are primarily due to the acquisitions of Arcadia and Ambercare\nduring the second quarter of 2018. In addition, net service revenues increased as a result of a 12.6% increase in billable hours and a 2.4% increase in revenues per billable hour in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. A significant amount of our net service revenues were derived from one payor client, the Illinois Department on Aging, which accounted for 31.0% and 36.5% of net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These increases in net service revenues were offset by a $9.7 million decrease in net service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of our adoption of ASC 606. Under ASC 606 the majority of what historically was classified as provision for doubtful accounts under operating expenses is now treated as an implicit price concession factored into net service revenues. See Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, decreased from 27.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 25.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to our adoption of ASC 606, as described above, which resulted in a $9.7 million decrease in net service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nProvision for doubtful accounts decreased by approximately $8.1 million to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to our adoption of ASC 606 which resulted in a $8.0 million decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts for the year ended December 31, 2017, as the majority of what historically was classified as provision for doubtful accounts under operating expenses is now treated as an implicit price concession factored into net service revenues.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by approximately $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to acquisitions that resulted in a $6.4 million increase in administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs, a $1.2 million increase in commissions, and a $0.7 million increase in rent expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nHospice Segment\n\nIn the second quarter of 2018, with the completion of the acquisition of Ambercare, we began operating a hospice segment. Hospice generates net service revenues by providing care to patients with a life expectancy of six months or less and their families. Net service revenues from Medicare and managed care organizations accounted for 93.6% and 5.6% for the year ending December 31, 2018, respectively.\nGross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues was 46.9% for the year ending December 31, 2018. General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues was 19.9% for the year ending December 31, 2018. The hospice segment's general and administrative expenses primarily consist of administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs, rent, information technology and office expenses. The hospice segment's operating income was $5.1 million for the year ending December 31, 2018.\nHome Health Segment\n\nOn May 1, 2018, with the acquisition of Ambercare, we began operating a home health segment. Home health generates net service revenues by providing home health services on a short-term, intermittent or episodic basis to individuals, generally to treat an illness or injury. Net service revenues from Medicare and managed care organizations accounted for 88.0% and 11.0% for the year ending December 31, 2018, respectively.\nGross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues was 33.4% for the year ending December 31, 2018. General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues was 22.6% for the year ending December 31, 2018. The home health segment's general and administrative expenses consist of administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs, rent, information technology and office expenses. The home health segment's operating income was $0.7 million for the year ending December 31, 2018.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our consolidated results of operations.\n\n (1) Average billable census is the number of unique clients receiving a billable service during the year. \n (2) Billable hours is the total number of hours served to clients during a year. \n (3) For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, revenue, gross profit, provision for doubtful accounts, operating expenses, operating income from continuing operations, income tax expense, net income from continuing operations and net income have been updated to reflect the correction, as discussed in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nNet service revenues from state, local and other governmental programs accounted for 64.2% and 70.5% of net service revenues for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Managed care organizations accounted for 33.1% and 26.0% of net service revenues in 2017 and 2016 respectively, with private and commercial payors accounting for the remainder of net service revenues. A significant amount of our net service revenues in 2017 and 2016 were derived from one payor client, Illinois Department on Aging, which accounted for 36.5% and 42.1% respectively, of our total net service revenues.\nNet service revenues increased $25.1 million, or 6.3%, to $426.0 million for 2017 compared to $400.9 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to a 4.1% increase in average billable census and a 2.9% increase in revenues per billable hour.\nGross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, increased to 27.2% for 2017, from 26.5% in 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $3.7 million reduction in direct service costs associated with benefits, travel mileage and unemployment taxes, and our exit from the lower margin adult day services centers.\nGeneral and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues decreased to 18.1% for 2017, from 19.2% in 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in severance and restructuring costs of $6.4 million and a decrease in costs for outside consultants of $0.9 million and a decrease in telephone expenses of $0.8 million. These decreases were offset by an increase in administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs of $7.4 million and an increase in acquisition expenses of $1.0 million.\nDepreciation and amortization increased slightly to $6.7 million from $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Amortization of intangibles, which are amortized using straight-line and accelerated methods, totaled $4.7 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nInterest Income\nIllinois law entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the statement of income caption, Interest income.\u201d For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not receive any prompt payment interest. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we received $2.8 million in prompt payment interest. While we may be owed additional prompt payment interest, the amount, timing, and intent to provide such payments remains uncertain, and we will continue to recognize prompt payment interest income upon satisfaction of these constraints.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased to $4.5 million from $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs in the amount of $1.3 million upon the termination of our Terminated Senior Secured Credit Facility on May 8, 2017, as well as increased interest expense due to the higher outstanding term loan balance under our credit facility. See Note 10 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, other income of $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, consisted of income distributions received from the investments in joint ventures, which were sold on October 1, 2017. We accounted for this income in accordance with ASC Topic 325, Investments-Other\u201d and recognized the net accumulated earnings only to the extent distributed by the joint ventures on the date received.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAll of our income is from domestic sources. We incur state and local taxes in states in which we operate. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our federal statutory rate was 35.0 % and 35.0%, respectively. The effective income tax rate was 39.0 % and 25.5% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The difference between our federal statutory and effective income tax rates are principally due to the inclusion of state taxes and the use of federal employment tax credits.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Reform Act\u201d). The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35.0% to a flat 21.0% rate, effective January 1, 2018. Our effective income tax rate increased by approximately 5.3% in 2017 due to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance as a result of the elimination of a performance-based equity exception in calculating the $1.0 million limitation for 162(m) under the Tax Reform Act.\nDiscontinued Operations\nEffective March 1, 2013, we sold substantially all of the assets used in our 2013 Home Health Business as described in Part I, Item 1. Therefore, we have segregated the 2013 Home Health Business operating results and presented them separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented, see Note 5 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe table below summarizes the results of discontinued operations.\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amounts In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should read the following discussion together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of the factors we describe under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other risks as well as other factors that are not currently known to us, that we currently consider immaterial or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions.\nOverview\nWe are a home care services provider operating in three segments: personal care; hospice; and home health. Our services are principally provided in the home under agreements with federal, state and local government agencies. Our consumers are predominantly dual eligible,\u201d meaning they are eligible to receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits. Managed care revenues accounted for 33.9%, 33.1% and 26.1% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nA summary of our financial results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 is provided in the table below.\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amounts in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net service revenues - continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 518,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 425,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 400,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 355,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 271,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 232,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Net service revenues and net income from continuing operations, net income and total assets have been updated to reflect the correction described in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nAs of December 31, 2018, we provided our services in 24 states through 156 offices. Our payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we served approximately 57,000, 51,000 and 50,000 discrete individuals, respectively. Our personal care segment also includes staffing services, with clients including assisted living facilities, nursing homes and hospice facilities.\nAcquisitions\nIn addition to our organic growth, we have grown through acquisitions that have expanded our presence in current markets or facilitated our entry into new markets where in-home care has been moving to managed care organizations.\nOn January 1, 2018, we acquired certain assets of LifeStyle Options, Inc. ( LifeStyle\u201d) in order to expand private pay services in Illinois. The total consideration for the transaction was $4.1 million, comprised of $3.3 million in cash and $0.8 million, which represented the estimated fair value of contingent consideration, subject to the achievement of certain performance targets set forth in an earn-out agreement. As of December 31, 2018, the performance targets were not met and the Company remeasured the earn-out to fair value.\nOn April 1, 2018, we completed an acquisition of certain assets of Arcadia for approximately $18.9 million. Arcadia provides home care services to approximately 2,300 consumers through 26 offices in 10 states. We funded this acquisition through the delayed draw term loan portion of our credit facility. In September 2018, we acquired certain affiliate branches of Arcadia for $0.6 million using cash on hand.\nOn May 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding stock of Ambercare for approximately $39.6 million plus the amount of excess cash held by Ambercare at closing (approximately $12.0 million). With the purchase of Ambercare, we expanded our personal care operations and acquired hospice and home health operations in the state of New Mexico. We funded this acquisition through the delayed draw term loan portion of our credit facility.\nEffective October 31, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of VIP Health Care Services for approximately $28.0 million. With the purchase of VIP Health Care Services, we will expand our personal care operations in the state of New York and into the New York City metropolitan area. We expect to complete this transaction in the second quarter of 2019,\ncontingent on the timing of certain regulatory approvals. We expect to fund this acquisition through a delayed draw term loan under our credit facility and available cash on hand.\nRevenue by Payor\nOur payor clients are principally federal, state and local governmental agencies and, increasingly, managed care organizations. The federal, state and local programs under which the agencies operate are subject to legislative, budgetary and other risks that can influence reimbursement rates. We are experiencing a transition of business from government payors to managed care organizations, which we believe aligns with our emphasis on coordinated care and the reduction of the need for acute care.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our payor revenue was:\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Personal Care\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n(in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nSegment\nNet\nService\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n(in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nSegment\nNet\nService\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n(in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nSegment\nNet\nService\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State, local and other\ngovernmental programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 286,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 273,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 282,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Managed care organizations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 173,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 140,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Private pay\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total personal care segment net\nservice revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 492,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 425,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 400,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWith the acquisition of Ambercare completed during the second quarter of 2018, we began to report our business with two additional segments, hospice and home health.

The state of Illinois did not adopt comprehensive budgets for fiscal years 2016 or 2017, ending June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2017, respectively. On July 6, 2017, the state of Illinois passed a budget for the state fiscal year 2018, which began on July 1, 2017, authorizing the Illinois Department on Aging to pay for our services rendered to non-Medicaid consumers provided in prior fiscal years. As of December 31, 2018, we have received substantially all such payments. On June 4, 2018, the state of Illinois passed a budget for state fiscal year 2019, which began in July 1, 2018.\nIn December 2014, the Chicago City Council passed an ordinance that will raise the minimum wage for Chicago workers to $13 per hour by July of 2019, with increases up to $1 per hour effective on July 1 of each year. The rate is $12 per hour effective July 1, 2018. The wage increase in 2016 did not have a material impact on our financial results because of our existing wage scale. The 2017\nwage increase was offset by a reimbursement rate increase. In the budget process for the 2019 fiscal year, a similar provision was proposed but was not included in the final budget. We believe that there is legislative support for a reimbursement rate increase and anticipate that an increase to offset the wage increase could be passed in the first half of 2019. Our financial performance will be impacted in quarters for which a reimbursement rate increase is not in effect.\nImpact of Changes in Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement\nIn April of 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d) issued a final rule, which beginning January 1, 2019, will allow Medicare Advantage insurers to offer beneficiaries more options and new benefits. Through this new rule, CMS has redefined health-related supplemental benefits to include services that increase health and improve quality of life, including coverage of non-skilled in-homecare. This policy change, emphasizing improving quality and reducing costs, aligns with our overall approach to care, and we believe the increased demand for personal care from the Medicare Advantage population represents a significant upside opportunity over the next three to five years.\nComponents of our Statements of Income\nNet Service Revenues\nWe generate net service revenues by providing our services directly to consumers and primarily on an hourly basis. We receive payment for providing such services from our payor clients, including federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private consumers. Net service revenues are principally provided based on authorized hours, determined by the relevant agency, at an hourly rate which is either contractual or fixed by legislation and are recognized at the time services are rendered.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, ( ASU 2014-09\u201d) which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach and did not record a cumulative catch-up adjustment as the timing and measurement of revenue for our customers consistent with our prior revenue recognition model. However, the majority of what historically was classified as provision for doubtful accounts under operating expenses is now treated as an implicit price concession factored into net service revenues.\nCost of Service Revenues\nWe incur direct care wages, payroll taxes and benefit-related costs in connection with providing our services. We also provide workers' compensation and general liability coverage for our employees.\nEmployees are also reimbursed for their travel time and related travel costs in certain instances.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses from continuing operations include our costs for operating our network of local agencies and our administrative offices.\nOur agency expenses from continuing operations consist of costs for supervisory personnel, our community care supervisors and office administrative costs. Personnel costs include wages, payroll taxes, and employee benefits. Facility costs including rents, utilities, and postage, telephone and office expenses. Our support centers include costs for accounting, information systems, human resources, billing and collections, contracting, marketing and executive leadership. These expenses consist of compensation, including stock-based compensation, payroll taxes, employee benefits, legal, accounting and other professional fees, travel, general insurance, rents and related facility costs.\nIn 2016, we initiated steps to streamline our operations. We incurred total expenses related to these initiatives of approximately $1.9 million, $1.7 million and $8.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The expenses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily relates to terminated employees resulting mainly from changes made to the management team during the year and other professional fees. The expenses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 included costs related to terminated employees resulting mainly from changes made to the management team made during the year, fees related to the termination of professional services relationships, other contract termination costs and asset write-offs. The expenses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016, included costs related to terminated employees resulted mainly from the closure of the contact center and other changes to the executive leadership team made during the year and other direct costs associated with implementing these initiatives including contract termination costs, accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nWe amortize our intangible assets with finite lives, consisting of customer and referral relationships, trade names, trademarks and non-compete agreements, principally using accelerated methods based upon their estimated useful lives. Depreciable assets consist principally of furniture and equipment, network administration and telephone equipment, and operating system software. Depreciable and leasehold assets are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line method over their useful lives or, if less and if applicable, their lease terms.\nProvision for Doubtful Accounts\nPrior to 2018, we established our allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent it was probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected. We established our provision for doubtful accounts primarily by reviewing the creditworthiness of significant customers and through evaluations over the collectability of the receivables. An allowance for doubtful accounts was maintained at a level that our management believed was sufficient to cover potential losses.\nIn 2018, subsequent adjustments that are determined to be the result of an adverse change in the payor's ability to pay are recognized as provision for doubtful accounts with the adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We recorded $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a reduction to revenue that would have been recorded as provision for doubtful accounts under the prior revenue recognition guidance.\nInterest Income\nIllinois law entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the statement of income caption, Interest income.\u201d For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016, we received $2.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively, in prompt payment interest. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not receive any prompt payment interest. While we may be owed additional prompt payment interest, the amount, timing, and intent to provide such payments remains uncertain, and we will continue to recognize prompt payment interest income upon satisfaction of these constraints\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income when incurred and consists of (i) interest and unused credit line fees on our credit facility, and our Terminated Senior Credit Facility (as defined under Senior Secured Credit Facility below), (ii) interest on our capital lease obligations and (iii) amortization and write-off of debt issuance costs.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income of $0.2 million consisted of income distributions received from investments in joint ventures, which were sold on October 1, 2017. We accounted for this income in accordance with ASC Topic 325, Investments-Other\u201d and recognized the net accumulated earnings only to the extent distributed by the joint ventures on the date received.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAll of our income is from domestic sources. We incur state and local taxes in states in which we operate. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our federal statutory rate was 21.0%, 35.0% and 35.0%, respectively. The effective income tax rate was 20.6%, 39.0% and 25.5% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The difference between our federal statutory and effective income tax rates are principally due to the inclusion of state taxes and the use of federal employment tax credits.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Reform Act\u201d). The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35.0% to a flat 21.0% rate, effective January 1, 2018. Our effective income tax rate increased by approximately 5.3% in 2017 due to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance as a result of the elimination of a performance-based equity exception in calculating the $1.0 million limitation for 162(m) under the Tax Reform Act.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDiscontinued operations consists of the reduction of the indemnification reserve, net of tax, for our 2013 Home Health Business that was sold effective March 1, 2013 and the results of operations for an agency in Pennsylvania that was sold on December 30, 2013.\nResults of

continuing operations, income tax expense, net income from continuing operations and net income have been updated to reflect the correction, as discussed in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nNet service revenues increased by 21.6% to $518.1 million for the year 2018 compared to $426.0 million in 2017. Net service revenues increased primarily due to the acquisitions of Arcadia and Ambercare during the second quarter of 2018 and an increase in average billable census for personal care services in 2018 as compared to 2017. This increase in net service revenues was offset by a $9.7 million decrease in net service revenues as a result of our adoption of ASC 606. Under ASC 606 the majority of what historically was classified as provision for doubtful accounts under operating expenses is now treated as an implicit price concession factored into net service revenues. See Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, decreased to 26.7% for 2018, from 27.2% in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to our adoption of ASC 606, as described above, which resulted in a $9.7 million decrease in net service revenues. This decrease was offset by the acquisition of the relatively higher margin Ambercare business in the second quarter of 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to $105.0 million as compared to $76.9 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to acquisitions that resulted in an increase in administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs of $14.3 million, an increase in acquisition expenses of $2.9 million and an increase in rent expense of $1.9 million. General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues increased to 20.3% for 2018, from 18.1% in 2017. The increase was primarily due to our adoption of ASC 606, as described above, which resulted in a $9.7 million decrease in net service revenues and an increase in administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs.\nProvision for doubtful accounts decreased by approximately $8.1 million to $0.3 million for 2018 compared to $8.4 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to our adoption of ASC 606 which resulted in a $8.0 million decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts as the majority of what historically was classified as provision for doubtful accounts under operating expenses is now treated as an implicit price concession factored into net service revenues.\nDepreciation and amortization increased to $8.6 million from $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily due to the increase of intangible assets related to the fiscal year 2018 acquisitions.\nInterest Income\nIllinois law entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the statement of income caption, Interest income.\u201d For the year ended December 31, 2018, we received $2.3 million in prompt payment interest. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not receive any prompt payment interest. While we may be owed additional prompt payment interest, the amount, timing, and intent to provide such payments remains uncertain, and we will continue to recognize prompt payment interest income upon satisfaction of these constraints.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased to $5.0 million from $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. The increases in interest expenses are primarily due to higher outstanding term loan balance under our credit facility in 2018 compared to 2017, offset by a write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs in the amount of $1.3 million upon the termination of our Terminated Senior Secured Credit Facility on May 8, 2017. See Note 10 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income of $0.2 million, consisted of income distributions received from the investments in joint ventures, which were sold on October 1, 2017. We accounted for this income in accordance with ASC Topic 325, Investments-Other\u201d and recognized the net accumulated earnings only to the extent distributed by the joint ventures on the date received.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAll of our income is from domestic sources. We incur state and local taxes in states in which we operate. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our federal statutory rate was 21.0% and 35.0%, respectively. The effective income tax rate was 20.6% and 39.0% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The difference between our federal statutory and effective income tax rates are principally due to the inclusion of state taxes and the use of federal employment tax credits.\nDiscontinued Operations\nEffective March 1, 2013, we sold substantially all of the assets used in our 2013 Home Health Business as described in Part I, Item 1. Therefore, we have segregated the 2013 Home Health Business operating results and presented them separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented, see Note 5 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe table below summarizes the results of discontinued operations.\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amounts In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (174\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (245\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNo revenues were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018 or 2017 related to the 2013 Home Health Business due to the sale of the business. For the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the earnings from discontinued operations represented our reduction of the Medicare indemnification reserve for the 2013 Home Health Business for periods no longer subject to audit. As of December 31, 2018, we have estimated no further billing adjustments for 2013 and 2012 which were previously subject to Medicare audits.\nResults of Operations - Segments\nThe following tables

operating expenses, operating income from continuing operations, income tax expense, net income from continuing operations and net income have been updated to reflect the correction, as discussed in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nNet service revenues increased by 15.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Net service revenues increased primarily as a result of a 13.0% increase in billable hours in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increases are primarily due to the acquisitions of Arcadia and Ambercare\nduring the second quarter of 2018. In addition, net service revenues increased as a result of a 12.6% increase in billable hours and a 2.4% increase in revenues per billable hour in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. A significant amount of our net service revenues were derived from one payor client, the Illinois Department on Aging, which accounted for 31.0% and 36.5% of net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These increases in net service revenues were offset by a $9.7 million decrease in net service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of our adoption of ASC 606. Under ASC 606 the majority of what historically was classified as provision for doubtful accounts under operating expenses is now treated as an implicit price concession factored into net service revenues. See Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, decreased from 27.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 25.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to our adoption of ASC 606, as described above, which resulted in a $9.7 million decrease in net service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nProvision for doubtful accounts decreased by approximately $8.1 million to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to our adoption of ASC 606 which resulted in a $8.0 million decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts for the year ended December 31, 2017, as the majority of what historically was classified as provision for doubtful accounts under operating expenses is now treated as an implicit price concession factored into net service revenues.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by approximately $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to acquisitions that resulted in a $6.4 million increase in administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs, a $1.2 million increase in commissions, and a $0.7 million increase in rent expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nHospice Segment\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hospice Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Segment\nNet Service\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amounts in Thousands,\nExcept Percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Results\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of services revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for doubtful accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business Metrics (Actual Numbers)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Admissions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average daily census\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average length of stay\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Patient days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 128,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue per patient day\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 146.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment Revenue by Payor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Managed care organizations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment net service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment revenue by significant states\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New Mexico\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment net service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the second quarter of 2018, with the completion of the acquisition of Ambercare, we began operating a hospice segment.

billable service during the year. \n (2) Billable hours is the total number of hours served to clients during a year. \n (3) For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, revenue, gross profit, provision for doubtful accounts, operating expenses, operating income from continuing operations, income tax expense, net income from continuing operations and net income have been updated to reflect the correction, as discussed in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nNet service revenues from state, local and other governmental programs accounted for 64.2% and 70.5% of net service revenues for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Managed care organizations accounted for 33.1% and 26.0% of net service revenues in 2017 and 2016 respectively, with private and commercial payors accounting for the remainder of net service revenues. A significant amount of our net service revenues in 2017 and 2016 were derived from one payor client, Illinois Department on Aging, which accounted for 36.5% and 42.1% respectively, of our total net service revenues.\nNet service revenues increased $25.1 million, or 6.3%, to $426.0 million for 2017 compared to $400.9 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to a 4.1% increase in average billable census and a 2.9% increase in revenues per billable hour.\nGross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, increased to 27.2% for 2017, from 26.5% in 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $3.7 million reduction in direct service costs associated with benefits, travel mileage and unemployment taxes, and our exit from the lower margin adult day services centers.\nGeneral and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues decreased to 18.1% for 2017, from 19.2% in 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in severance and restructuring costs of $6.4 million and a decrease in costs for outside consultants of $0.9 million and a decrease in telephone expenses of $0.8 million. These decreases were offset by an increase in administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs of $7.4 million and an increase in acquisition expenses of $1.0 million.\nDepreciation and amortization increased slightly to $6.7 million from $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Amortization of intangibles, which are amortized using straight-line and accelerated methods, totaled $4.7 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nInterest Income\nIllinois law entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the statement of income caption, Interest income.\u201d For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not receive any prompt payment interest. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we received $2.8 million in prompt payment interest. While we may be owed additional prompt payment interest, the amount, timing, and intent to provide such payments remains uncertain, and we will continue to recognize prompt payment interest income upon satisfaction of these constraints.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased to $4.5 million from $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs in the amount of $1.3 million upon the termination of our Terminated Senior Secured Credit Facility on May 8, 2017, as well as increased interest expense due to the higher outstanding term loan balance under our credit facility. See Note 10 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, other income of $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, consisted of income distributions received from the investments in joint ventures, which were sold on October 1, 2017. We accounted for this income in accordance with ASC Topic 325, Investments-Other\u201d and recognized the net accumulated earnings only to the extent distributed by the joint ventures on the date received.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAll of our income is from domestic sources. We incur state and local taxes in states in which we operate. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our federal statutory rate was 35.0 % and 35.0%, respectively. The effective income tax rate was 39.0 % and 25.5% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The difference between our federal statutory and effective income tax rates are principally due to the inclusion of state taxes and the use of federal employment tax credits.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Reform Act\u201d). The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35.0% to a flat 21.0% rate, effective January 1, 2018. Our effective income tax rate increased by approximately 5.3% in 2017 due to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance as a result of the elimination of a performance-based equity exception in calculating the $1.0 million limitation for 162(m) under the Tax Reform Act.\nDiscontinued Operations\nEffective March 1, 2013, we sold substantially all of the assets used in our 2013 Home Health Business as described in Part I, Item 1. Therefore, we have segregated the 2013 Home Health Business operating results and presented them separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented, see Note 5 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe table below summarizes the results of discontinued operations.\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amounts In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General"}
