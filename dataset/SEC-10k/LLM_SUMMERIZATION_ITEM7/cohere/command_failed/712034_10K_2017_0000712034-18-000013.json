MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of ACCO Brands Corporation and the accompanying notes contained in Item 8. of this report. Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations.\nOverview of the Company\nACCO Brands is a designer, marketer and manufacturer of recognized consumer and end-user demanded brands used in businesses, schools, and homes. Our widely known brands include AT-A-GLANCE\u00ae, Derwent\u00ae, Esselte\u00ae, Five Star\u00ae, GBC\u00ae, Hilroy\u00ae, Kensington\u00ae, Leitz\u00ae, Marbig\u00ae, Mead\u00ae, NOBO\u00ae, Quartet\u00ae, Rapid\u00ae, Rexel\u00ae, Swingline\u00ae, Tilibra\u00ae and Wilson Jones\u00ae. More than 80% of our net sales come from brands that occupy the number one or number two positions in the select product categories in which we compete. We distribute our products through a wide variety of retail and commercial channels to ensure that our products are readily and conveniently available for purchase by consumers and other end-users, wherever they prefer to shop. These channels include mass retailers, e-tailers, discount, drug/grocery and variety chains; warehouse clubs; hardware and specialty stores; independent office product dealers; office superstores; and contract stationers. Our products are sold primarily in the U.S., Europe, Australia, Canada, Brazil and Mexico. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 55% of our sales were outside the U.S., up from 43% in 2016. This increase was the result of the Esselte and Pelikan Artline acquisitions, which further extended our geographic reach.\nOver the past several years we have transformed our business by: divesting certain non-core commercially-oriented product lines; acquiring companies with consumer and end-user demanded brands, and continuing to diversify our distribution channels. In 2012, we acquired the Mead Consumer and Office Products business (\"Mead C&OP\"), which substantially increased our presence in North America and Brazil in school and calendar products with well-known consumer brands. In 2016, we purchased the remaining equity interest in Pelikan Artline from our joint venture partner, which enhanced our competitive position in school and business products in Australia and New Zealand and added new consumer categories, including writing instruments and janitorial supplies. In early 2017, we acquired Esselte Group Holdings AB (\"Esselte\"), which more than doubled our presence in Europe and added several iconic business brands, a significant base of independent dealer customers, and a new product category of do-it-yourself hardware tools. Together these three acquisitions have meaningfully expanded our portfolio of well-known end-user demanded brands, enhanced our competitive position from both a product and channel perspective, and added scale to our business operations.\nToday our Company is a global enterprise focused on developing innovative branded consumer products for use in businesses, schools and homes. We believe our leading product category positions provide the scale to enable us to invest in marketing and product innovation to drive profitable growth. We expect to derive much of our growth, over the long term, in faster-growing emerging geographies such as Latin America and parts of Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe, which exhibit stronger demand for our product categories than in developed markets. In all of our markets we see opportunities to grow sales through share gains, channel expansion and innovative products. We plan to supplement organic growth globally with strategic acquisitions in both existing and adjacent product categories.\nAcquisitions\nEsselte Group Holdings AB Acquisition and Refinancing\nOn January 31, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition (the \"Esselte Acquisition\") of Esselte. Accordingly, the results of Esselte are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from February 1, 2017 forward and are reported in all three of the Company's segments, but primarily in the ACCO Brands EMEA segment. The acquisition of Esselte made ACCO Brands a leading European manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer and office products, and improved ACCO Brands' scale. Esselte products are primarily marketed under the Leitz\u00ae, Rapid\u00ae and Esselte\u00ae brands in the storage and organization, stapling, punching, binding and laminating equipment and do-it-yourself tools product categories.\nThe cash purchase price paid was $292.3 million, net of cash acquired of $34.2 million. In connection with the Esselte Acquisition, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"2017 Credit Agreement\"), dated as of January 27, 2017. The 2017 Credit Agreement provides for a five-year senior secured credit facility, which consists of a \u20ac300.0 million (US$320.8 million based on January 27, 2017 exchange rates) term loan facility (the \"Euro Term Loan A\"), a A$80.0 million (US$60.4 million based on January 27, 2017 exchange rates) term loan facility (the \"AUD Term Loan A\"), and a\nUS$400.0 million multi-currency revolving credit facility (the \"2017 Revolving Facility\").\nPelikan Artline Joint-Venture Acquisition\nOn May 2, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Australia Stationery Industries, Inc. (the \"PA Acquisition\"), which indirectly owned the 50% of the Pelikan Artline joint-venture and the issued capital stock of Pelikan Artline Pty Limited (collectively, \"Pelikan Artline\") that was not already owned by the Company. Prior to the PA Acquisition, the Pelikan Artline joint-venture was accounted for using the equity method. The results of Pelikan Artline are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from May 2, 2016 forward, and are reported in the ACCO Brands International segment. Accordingly, we no longer separately report equity in earnings from this joint-venture. Pelikan Artline is a premier distributor of recognized consumer brands used in businesses, schools, and homes in Australia and New Zealand.\nFor further information on the acquisitions, see \"Note 3. Acquisitions\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report. For information on the financings of the acquisitions, see \"Note 4. Long-term Debt and Short-term Borrowings\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nReportable Segments\nEffective in the first quarter of 2017, as a result of the Esselte Acquisition, the Company realigned its operating structure, which affected the makeup of its business segments for financial reporting purposes. The Company has three operating business segments each of which is comprised of different geographic regions. The Company no longer reports the results of its Computer Products Group as a separate segment. Results of the former Computer Products Group are reflected in the appropriate geographic segment based on the region from which sales are made. The Company's three realigned business segments are as follows:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Geographic Regions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primary Brands\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ACCO Brands North America\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>United States and Canada\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AT-A-GLANCE\u00ae, Five Star\u00ae, GBC\u00ae, Hilroy\u00ae, Kensington\u00ae, Mead\u00ae, Quartet\u00ae, and Swingline\u00ae\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ACCO Brands EMEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Europe, Middle East and Africa\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Derwent\u00ae, Esselte\u00ae, GBC\u00ae, Kensington\u00ae, Leitz\u00ae, NOBO\u00ae, Rapid\u00ae, and Rexel\u00ae\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ACCO Brands International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Australia, Latin America and Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Artline\u00ae, GBC\u00ae, Kensington\u00ae, Marbig\u00ae, Quartet\u00ae, Rexel\u00ae, Tilibra\u00ae, and Wilson Jones\u00ae\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have restated our financial statements for each of the periods presented to reflect this change in reportable business segments.\nEach of the Company's three operating segments designs, markets, sources, manufactures and sells recognized consumer and end-user demanded brands used in businesses, schools and homes. Product designs are tailored based on end-user preferences in each geographic region.\nOur product categories include storage and organization; stapling; punching; laminating, binding and shredding machines and related consumable supplies; whiteboards; notebooks; calendars; computer accessories; and do-it-yourself tools, among others. Our portfolio of consumer and end-user demanded brands includes both globally and regionally recognized brands.\nACCO Brands markets and sells its strong multi-product offering broadly and is not dependent on any one channel. Our products are sold through all relevant channels, namely retailers, including: mass retailers; e-tailers; discount, drug/grocery and variety chains; warehouse clubs; hardware and specialty stores; independent office product dealers; office superstores; and contract stationers. We also sell directly to commercial and consumer end-users through our e-commerce platform and our direct sales organization.\nFor further information on our business segments see \"Note 16. Information on Business Segments\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report.\nOverview of 2017 Performance\nOur financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflect the significant benefit of our acquisitions. The Esselte Acquisition and the PA Acquisition primarily impact the financial results of our EMEA and International segments, respectively. For more information, see \"Note 3. Acquisitions\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nThe Company's cash flow from operations, effective tax rate and interest payments were impacted by the refinancing of our senior unsecured notes in December 2016 to obtain a lower interest rate, and the increase in our bank debt in January 2017 to finance the Esselte Acquisition. For further information, see \"Note 4. Long-term Debt and Short-term Borrowings\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nIn addition, we recorded a tax benefit of $25.7 million related to the newly passed U.S Tax Act in December of 2017. For further information, see \"Note 11. Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nForeign currency translation also impacted our consolidated financial statements favorably for the year ended December 31, 2017. Where necessary, we adjust sales prices to cover the impacts of currency fluctuation on our cost of goods sold and take currency positions to allow for the time needed to generally achieve the sales price adjustments.\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions of dollars, except per share data)\n</td> <td>2017(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%/pts\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,948.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,557.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>391.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>1,292.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,042.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>656.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>515.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin\n</td> <td>33.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>406.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>320.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>35.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>21.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>193.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income margin\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>41.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>(5.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings of joint venture\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>26.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>131.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding:\n</td> <td>110.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted income per share\n</td> <td>1.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The Company acquired Esselte on January 31, 2017;

Foreign currency translation increased sales by $12.4 million, or 1% in the current-year period. Comparable net sales, excluding the acquisitions and foreign currency translation, were down primarily due to declines at certain office superstore customers and lost product placements.\nCost of Products Sold\nCost of products sold includes all manufacturing, product sourcing and distribution costs, including depreciation related to assets used in the manufacturing, procurement and distribution processes, allocation of certain information technology costs supporting those processes, inbound and outbound freight, shipping and handling costs, purchasing costs associated with materials and packaging used in the production processes and inventory valuation adjustments. Cost of products sold of $1,292.4 million, was up $250.4 million, or 24%, from $1,042.0 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced cost of\nproducts sold by $8.4 million, or 1% in the current-year period. Underlying cost of products sold, excluding foreign currency translation, increased due to the inclusion of the acquisitions, partially offset by lower comparable sales and cost savings and productivity improvements.\nGross Profit\nWe believe that gross profit and gross profit margin provide enhanced shareholder appreciation of underlying profit drivers. Gross profit of $656.4 million, was up $141.3 million, or 27%, from $515.1 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased gross profit by $4.0 million, or 1% in the current-year period. Underlying gross profit, excluding foreign currency translation, increased due to the inclusion of the acquisitions, together with productivity initiatives and higher pricing, which was partially offset by lower comparable sales and inflation.\nGross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 33.7% from 33.1%. The increase was primarily due to productivity improvements and higher pricing.\nSelling, General and Administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") include advertising, marketing, selling (including commissions), research and development, customer service, depreciation related to assets outside the manufacturing and distribution processes, and all other general and administrative expenses outside the manufacturing and distribution functions (e.g., finance, human resources, information technology and corporate expenses). SG&A of $406.1 million, was up $85.3 million, or 27%, from $320.8 million in the prior-year period. The current-year period includes $16.4 million of integration and transaction costs related to the acquisitions. The prior-year period included $12.8 million in transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions. Foreign currency translation increased SG&A by $0.6 million, or 0.2%, in the current-year period. Underlying SG&A, excluding integration and transaction costs and foreign currency translation, increased primarily due to the inclusion of the acquisitions.\nAs a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased to 20.8% from 20.6% in the prior-year period, primarily due to higher integration and transaction costs incurred in the current-year period, partially offset by productivity initiatives.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nAmortization of intangibles of $35.6 million, was up $14.0 million, or 65%, from $21.6 million in the prior-year period. The increase was due to the inclusion of the Esselte and PA Acquisitions.\nRestructuring Charges\nRestructuring charges in the current-year period of $21.7 million related primarily to the integrations of Esselte and Pelikan Artline. Restructuring charges in the prior-year period of $5.4 million related primarily to the integration of Pelikan Artline and consolidation of certain functions in the North America segment.\nOperating Income\nOperating income of $193.0 million, was up $25.7 million, or 15%, from $167.3 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $3.2 million, or 2%, in the current-year period. Underlying operating income, excluding restructuring, transaction and integration costs, and foreign currency translation, increased primarily due to the inclusion of the acquisitions.\nInterest Expense, Equity in Earnings of Joint Venture and Other (Income) Expense, Net\nInterest expense of $41.1 million, was down $8.2 million, or 17%, from $49.3 million in the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to the lower interest rate paid on our senior unsecured notes, which were refinanced in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by interest resulting from increased debt incurred in connection with the Esselte Acquisition. The prior-year period included $2.5 million of incremental interest expense related to the above-referenced refinancing of our senior unsecured notes and the accelerated amortization of debt issuance cost related to the prepayment of $70 million on our U.S. Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A.\nAs a result of the PA Acquisition, which was completed on May 2, 2016, equity in earnings of joint venture decreased $2.1 million as the Company ceased accounting for the Pelikan Artline joint-venture using the equity method of accounting.\nOther (income) expense, net was income of $0.4 million compared to expense of $1.4 million in the prior-year period. The current-year period included a $2.3 million foreign currency gain related to the settlement of certain intercompany loan transactions. The prior-year period included charges associated with the refinancing of our senior unsecured notes. These charges consisted of $25.0 million in a \"make-whole\" call premium and a $4.9 million charge for the write-off of debt issuance costs, which were offset by a $28.9 million non-cash gain arising from the PA Acquisition due to the revaluation of the Company's previously held equity interest to fair value and a gain on the settlement of an intercompany loan of $1.0 million, previously deemed permanently invested.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the current-year period, income tax expense was $26.4 million on income before taxes of $158.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 16.7%. The low effective tax rate for the current-year period is primarily due to a net tax benefit of $25.7 million related to the newly passed U.S. Tax Act in December of 2017. This benefit was driven by the reduction of net deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings (the \"Transition Toll Tax\"). For further information on the impact of the U.S. Tax Act, see \"Note 11. Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report. Also contributing to the low effective rate was $5.6 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation related to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. See \"Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report for details on the adoption of this new standard.\nFor the prior-year period, income tax expense was $29.6 million on income before taxes of $125.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 23.7%. The low effective tax rate in the prior-year period was primarily due to the following: 1) the $28.9 million gain arising from the PA Acquisition due to the revaluation of the previously held equity interest to fair value, which was not subject to tax, and 2) tax losses on foreign exchange on the repayment of intercompany loans, for which the pre-tax effect was recorded in equity.\nNet Income\nNet income of $131.7 million, was up $36.2 million, or 38%, from $95.5 million in the prior-year period. Diluted income per share was $1.19, up $0.32, or 37% from $0.87 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased net income by $5.9 million, or 6% in the current-year period. The increase in net income was primarily due to inclusion of the acquisitions, lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate.\nSegment Net Sales and Operating Income for the Years Ended

Foreign currency translation increased sales by $2.0 million, or 0.2%, in the current-year period. Comparable net sales, excluding Esselte and foreign currency translation, decreased primarily due to continued declines with office superstore customers and lost product placements with certain customers. Sales during the back-to-school season were down slightly compared to the prior year, which had strong growth.\nACCO Brands North America operating income of $155.6 million, was up $2.3 million, or 2%, from $153.3 million in the prior-year period, and operating income as a percent of net sales increased to 15.6% from 15.1%. The increase was due to higher gross margins from cost savings and productivity initiatives, and reduced customer sales rebates, which were partially offset by lower comparable sales, higher go-to-market spending and $5.5 million in restructuring charges (versus $1.1 million in the prior-year period). The restructuring charges related to the realignment of the operating structure of our former Computer Products Group, the Esselte integration and other projects to enhance the future long-term performance of the business.\nACCO Brands EMEA\nACCO Brands EMEA net sales of $542.8 million, including approximately $388 million attributable to the Esselte Acquisition, were up $371.0 million, or 216%, from $171.8 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased sales by $0.8 million, or 0.5%, in the current-year period. Comparable net sales, excluding Esselte and foreign currency translation, decreased due to lost product placements and inventory reductions by certain customers.\nACCO Brands EMEA operating income of $37.1 million, including approximately $24.9 million attributable to the Esselte Acquisition, was up $24.5 million, or 194%, from $12.6 million in the prior-year period, but operating income as a percent of net sales decreased to 6.8% from 7.3%. The increase in operating income was driven by the Esselte Acquisition and includes restructuring costs of $11.2 million, integration costs of $5.5 million, and the amortization of step-up in the value of finished goods inventory of $0.8 million. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $2.4 million in the current-year period. Underlying operating income, excluding Esselte, restructuring and integration costs, foreign currency translation and the amortization of step-up in the value of finished goods inventory, decreased due to lower comparable sales, partially offset by reduced SG&A expenses.\nOperating income as a percent of sales decreased due to restructuring and integration costs, higher intangible amortization resulting from the Esselte Acquisition and lower gross margins (primarily due to Esselte having lower margins than the legacy ACCO business), partially offset by the lower SG&A margins in the legacy Esselte business.\nACCO Brands International\nACCO Brands International net sales of $407.0 million, including $37.9 million attributable to the PA and Esselte Acquisitions, were up $37.8 million, or 10%, from $369.2 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased sales by $9.6 million, or 3% in the current-year period. Comparable net sales, excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translation, decreased primarily due to lost product placements and inventory reductions in Australia, partially offset by higher sales in Brazil and Mexico.\nACCO Brands International operating income of $50.9 million, was up $1.5 million, or 3%, from $49.4 million in the prior-year period, but operating income as a percent of net sales decreased to 12.5% from 13.4%. Restructuring and integration costs in the current-year period were $5.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively. In addition, the current-year period includes a $1.5 million gain on the sale of a distribution center in New Zealand related to the integration of Pelikan Artline. The prior-year period includes restructuring costs of $4.3 million, integration costs of $2.3 million and the amortization of the step-up in value of the finished goods inventory of $0.4 million. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $0.7 million in the current-year period. Underlying operating income, excluding restructuring and integration costs, the amortization of step-up in the value of finished goods inventory, the gain on sale of the distribution center and foreign currency translation, was flat due to the inclusion of the results of Pelikan Artline in the current-year period and improved profitability in Brazil and Mexico, which was offset by lower comparable net sales and higher distribution costs associated with the warehouse and IT system consolidation in Australia.\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and

$1,510.4 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced net sales by $16.9 million, or 1%. Comparable net sales, excluding Pelikan Artline and foreign currency translation, were down due to declines at certain wholesalers and office superstores customers, partially offset by strong growth at mass and e-tail customers.\nCost of Products Sold\nCost of products sold of $1,042.0 million, including $47.7 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, was up $10.0 million, or 1%, from $1,032.0 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation decreased cost of products sold by $13.3 million, or 1%. Underlying cost of products sold, excluding Pelikan Artline and foreign currency translation, decreased due to lower sales volume and productivity improvements, partially offset by foreign-exchange-related inflationary increases in certain foreign markets' cost of products sold.\nGross Profit\nGross profit of $515.1 million, including $30.8 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, was up $36.7 million, or 8%, from $478.4 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation decreased gross profit by $3.6 million, or 1%. Underlying gross profit, excluding Pelikan Artline and foreign currency translation, increased due to higher pricing and productivity improvements, which were partially offset by foreign-exchange-related inflationary increases in certain foreign markets' costs of products sold.\nGross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 33.1% from 31.7% in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to cost savings and productivity improvements, higher pricing and the positive impact of the PA Acquisition.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A of $320.8 million, including $16.6 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, was up $25.1 million, or 8%, from $295.7 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced SG&A by $4.8 million, or 2%. The prior-year period included $3.6 million of integration and transaction costs related to the PA Acquisition. Underlying SG&A, excluding Pelikan Artline and foreign currency translation, increased, driven by higher professional fees, including $9.2 million of transaction costs related to the Esselte Acquisition. Additionally, the prior-year period benefited from a one-time $2.3 million recovery of an indirect tax in Brazil.\nAs a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased to 20.6% from 19.6% in the prior-year period for the reasons mentioned above.\nRestructuring Charges (Credits)\nWe initiated cost reduction plans related to the consolidation and integration of Pelikan Artline with our already existing Australian and New Zealand businesses and, as a result, incurred $4.2 million of charges in 2016, primarily related to severance. In addition, in 2016 we initiated additional cost reduction plans and incurred $1.2 million of severance charges related to the consolidation of certain functions in the North America segment.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nAmortization of intangibles was $21.6 million, up $2.0 million, or 10%, from $19.6 million in the prior-year period. The increase was due to the inclusion due to the PA Acquisition.\nOperating Income\nOperating income of $167.3 million, including $5.6 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, was up $3.8 million, or 2%, from $163.5 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $1.6 million, or 1%. Underlying operating income, excluding the PA Acquisition and foreign currency translation, decreased primarily due to increased SG&A.\nInterest Expense and Other Expense, Net\nInterest expense of $49.3 million, was up $4.8 million, or 11%, from $44.5 million in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to additional debt incurred to finance the PA Acquisition and the refinancing of our senior unsecured notes which resulted in the payment of $2.5 million of incremental interest expense. Also contributing to the increase was the accelerated amortization of debt issuance cost related to the prepayment of $70 million on our U.S. Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A.\nOther expense, net of $1.4 million was down $0.7 million from $2.1 million in the prior-year period. The 2016 year included charges associated with the above referenced refinancing of our senior unsecured notes. These charges consisted of $25.0 million in a \"make-whole\" call premium and a $4.9 million charge for the write-off of debt issuance costs, which were offset by a $28.9 million non-cash gain arising from the PA Acquisition due to the revaluation of the Company's previously held equity interest to fair value and a gain on the settlement of an intercompany loan of $1.0 million, previously deemed permanently invested. In the prior-year period we wrote-off $1.9 million of debt issuance costs related to the refinancing completed in 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $29.6 million on income before taxes of $125.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 23.7%. For the prior-year period, income tax expense was $45.5 million on income before taxes of $131.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 34.6%. The low effective tax rate in 2016 was primarily due to the following: 1) the $28.9 million non-cash gain arising from the PA Acquisition due to the revaluation of the previously held equity interest to fair value, which was not subject to tax, and 2) tax losses on foreign exchange on the repayment of intercompany loans, for which the pre-tax effect was recorded in equity.\nNet Income\nNet income was $95.5 million, up $9.6 million, or 11%, from $85.9 million in the prior-year period. Diluted income per share was $0.87, up $0.09, or 12% from $0.78 per diluted share in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to the lower effective tax rate in 2016.\nSegment Net Sales and Operating Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td>

Underlying operating income, excluding foreign currency translation, decreased primarily due to lower comparable net sales, partially offset by higher gross margins.\nACCO Brands International\nACCO Brands International net sales of $369.2 million, including $78.5 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, were up $84.2 million, or 30%, from $285.0 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by $4.2 million,\nor 1%. Comparable net sales, excluding Pelikan Artline and foreign currency translation, increased due to higher pricing, which benefited sales by 9%. Price increases were implemented to recover gross margins following foreign-exchange-related cost of products sold increases, in Australia and Mexico, as well as to offset paper related inflation in Brazil. Partially offsetting the price increases were volume declines, primarily in the legacy ACCO Brands Australian business.\nACCO Brands International operating income of $49.4 million, including $6.9 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, increased $20.3 million, or 70%, from $29.1 million in the prior-year period, and operating income as a percent of net sales increased to 13.4% from 10.2% in the prior-year period. Pelikan Artline operating income of $6.9 million includes restructuring costs of $4.2 million and integration costs of $2.3 million. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $1.7 million, or 6%, due to the recovery of the Brazilian real, which occurred in the seasonally stronger fourth quarter. Underlying operating income, excluding Pelikan Artline and foreign currency translation, increased due to higher pricing and productivity improvements, partially offset by lower volumes. In addition, the prior-year period included a one-time $2.3 million recovery of an indirect tax and $1.3 million of severance charges, both in Brazil.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary liquidity needs are to service indebtedness, fund capital expenditures and support working capital requirements. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents held and seasonal borrowings under our 2017 Revolving Facility. As of December 31, 2017, there was $133.9 million in borrowings outstanding under our $400.0 million 2017 Revolving Facility and the amount available for borrowings was $255.0 million (allowing for $11.1 million of letters of credit outstanding on that date).\nWe maintain adequate financing arrangements at market rates. Because of the seasonality of our business, we typically generate much of our cash flow in the first, third and fourth quarters, as accounts receivables are collected, and we use cash in the second quarter to fund working capital in order to support the North America back-to-school season. Our Brazilian business is highly seasonal due to the timing of the back-to-school season, which coincides with the calendar year-end in the fourth quarter. Due to various tax laws, it is costly to transfer short-term working capital in and out of Brazil; therefore, our normal practice is to hold seasonal cash requirements in Brazil, and invest in short-term Brazilian government securities. Consolidated cash and cash equivalents was $76.9 million as of December 31, 2017, approximately $31 million of which was held in Brazil.\nOn February 12, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved the initiation of a cash dividend program under which the Company will pay a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share on its common stock ($0.24 per share on an annualized basis). In addition, on February 14, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved an authorization to repurchase up to an additional $100 million in shares of its common stock. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $84.0 million remaining of its prior authorizations.\nOur priorities for cash flow use over the near term, after funding business operations, including restructuring expenditures, are debt reduction, dividends, stock repurchases and to fund strategic acquisitions.\nThe current senior secured credit facilities had a weighted average interest rate of 3.48% as of December 31, 2017 and our senior unsecured notes have a fixed interest rate of 5.25%.\nDebt Amendments and Refinancing\nThird Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\nIn connection with the Esselte Acquisition, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"2017 Credit Agreement\"), dated as of January 27, 2017, among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other agents and various lenders party thereto. The 2017 Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company's Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated April 28, 2015 (the \"2015 Credit Agreement\").\nThe 2017 Credit Agreement provides a five-year senior secured credit facility, which consists of a \u20ac300 million (US$320.8 million based on January 27, 2017 exchange rates) term loan facility (the \"Euro Term Loan A\"), a A$80 million (US$60.4 million based on January 27, 2017 exchange rates) term loan facility (the \"AUD Term Loan A\" and, together with the Euro Term Loan A, the \"2017 Term A Loan Facility\"), and a US$400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility (the \"2017 Revolving Facility\").\nMaturity and Amortization\nBorrowings under the 2017 Revolving Facility and the 2017 Term A Loan Facility mature on January 27, 2022. Amounts under the 2017 Revolving Facility are non-amortizing. Beginning June 30, 2017, the outstanding principal amounts under the 2017 Term A Loan Facility are payable in quarterly installments in an amount representing, on an annual basis, 5.0% of the initial aggregate principal amount of such loan facility and increasing to 12.5% on an annual basis by June 30, 2020.\nInterest rates\nAmounts outstanding under the 2017 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Euro Rate with a 0% floor, the Australian BBSR Rate, the Canadian BA Rate or the Base Rate, as applicable and as each such rate is defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement, plus an \"applicable rate.\" The applicable rate applied to outstanding Euro, Australian and Canadian dollar denominated loans and Base Rate loans is based on the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement) as follows:\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated\nLeverage Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Applicable Rate on Euro/AUD/CDN Dollar Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Applicable Rate on Base Rate Loans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>> 4.00 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.50%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2264 4.00 to 1.00 and > 3.50 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.25%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2264 3.50 to 1.00 and > 3.00 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2264 3.00 to 1.00 and > 2.00 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.50%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2264 2.00 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, the applicable rate on Euro, Australian and Canadian dollar loans was 1.50% and the applicable rate on Base Rate loans was 0.50%. Undrawn amounts under the 2017 Revolving Facility are subject to a commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.40% per annum, depending on the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio. As of December 31, 2017, the commitment fee rate was 0.30%.\nPrepayments\nSubject to certain conditions and specific exceptions, the 2017 Credit Agreement requires the Company to prepay outstanding amounts under the 2017 Credit Agreement under various circumstances, including (a) if sales or dispositions of certain property or assets in any fiscal year results in the receipt of net cash proceeds of $12.0 million, then an amount equal to 100% of the net cash proceeds received in excess of such $12.0 million, and (b) with respect to the AUD Term Loan A, in an amount equal to 100% of the net cash proceeds received from the disposition of any real property located in Australia. The Company also would be required to make prepayments in the event it receives proceeds related to certain property insurance or condemnation awards, from additional debt other than debt permitted under the 2017 Credit Agreement and from excess cash flow as determined under the 2017 Credit Agreement. The 2017 Credit Agreement also contains other customary prepayment obligations and provides for voluntary commitment reductions and prepayment of loans, subject to certain conditions and exceptions.\nDividends and Share Repurchases\nUnder the 2017 Credit Agreement, the Company may pay dividends and/or repurchase shares in an aggregate amount not to exceed the sum of: (i) the greater of $30 million and 1.00% of the Company's Consolidated Total Assets (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement); plus (ii) an additional amount not to exceed $75.0 million in any fiscal year (provided the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio after giving pro forma effect to the restricted payment would be greater than 2.50:1.00 and less than or equal to 3.75:1.00); plus (iii) an additional amount so long as the Consolidated Leverage Ratio after giving pro forma effect to the restricted payment would be less than or equal to 2.50:1.00; plus (iv) any Net Equity Proceeds (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement).\nFinancial Covenants\nThe Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter may not exceed 3.75:1.00; provided that following the consummation of a Material Acquisition (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement), and as of the end of the fiscal quarter in which such Material Acquisition occurred and as of the end of the three fiscal quarters thereafter, the maximum\nConsolidated Leverage Ratio level above will increase by 0.50:1.00, provided that no more than one such increase can be in effect at any time. The Esselte Acquisition qualified as a Material Acquisition under the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nThe 2017 Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement) as of the end of any fiscal quarter at or above 1.25 to 1.00.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 2.6 to 1 and our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio was approximately 5.3 to 1.\nOther Covenants and Restrictions\nThe 2017 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults, certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, certain ERISA-related events, changes in control or ownership and invalidity of any loan document. The 2017 Credit Agreement also establishes limitations on the aggregate amount of Permitted Acquisitions and Investments (each as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement) that the Company and its subsidiaries may make during the term of the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nAs of and for the periods ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all applicable loan covenants.\nGuarantees and Security\nGenerally, obligations under the 2017 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Company's existing and future subsidiaries, and are secured by substantially all of the Company's and certain guarantor subsidiaries' assets, subject to certain exclusions and limitations.\nIncremental Facilities\nThe 2017 Credit Agreement permits the Company to seek increases in the size of the 2017 Revolving Facility and the 2017 Term A Loan Facility prior to maturity by up to $500.0 million in the aggregate, subject to lender commitment and the conditions set forth in the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nSenior Unsecured Notes due December 2024\nOn December 22, 2016, the Company completed a private offering of $400.0 million in senior unsecured notes, due December 2024 (the \"New Notes\"), which bear interest at 5.25%. Net proceeds from the sale of the New Notes, together with borrowings of $73.9 million under the Company's revolving credit facility and cash on hand, were used to redeem the then existing senior unsecured notes (the \"Old Notes\"). The aggregate redemption price of $531.5 million consisted of principal due and payable on the Old Notes, a \"make-whole\" call premium of $25.0 million (included in \"Other (income) expense, net\"), and accrued and unpaid interest of $6.5 million (included in \"Interest expense\") which the Company irrevocably deposited with the trustee of the Old Notes thereby satisfying all its obligations related to the Old Notes.\nAlso included in \"Other expense, net\" is a $4.9 million charge for the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the Old Notes. Additionally, we incurred and capitalized approximately $6.1 million in bank, legal and other fees associated with the issuance of the New Notes.\nRestructuring and Integration Activities\nFrom time to time the Company may implement restructuring, realignment or cost-reduction plans and activities, including those related to integrating acquired businesses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an aggregate $21.7 million in restructuring expenses primarily related to the integration of the ACCO Brands and Esselte operations worldwide. The remaining charges relate to the integration of ACCO Brands and Pelikan Artline operations in Australia and New Zealand, and the change in the operating structure in North America, including integration of our former Computer Products Group into our remaining business segments. As of December 31, 2017, there was $13.3 million remaining of restructuring liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. For further information, see \"Note 10. Restructuring\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an aggregate $11.4 million in non-restructuring integration expenses related to the integration of the ACCO Brands and Esselte and Pelikan Artline operations.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company approved additional restructuring projects aggregating to $3.5 million, primarily related to changes to the structure in the ACCO Brands North America segment and the continued integration of Esselte in the ACCO Brands EMEA segment. In accordance with GAAP, none of the aforementioned liabilities were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nConsistent with our previous communications about the Esselte Acquisition, the Company currently expects it will record approximately $4 million for integration activities and $4 million of incremental restructuring expenses during the remainder of 2018, which is in addition to the $3.5 million of restructuring projects approved during the first quarter of 2018. As integration plans are still being finalized, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the nature or timing of these restructuring and integration charges or the timing of their associated cash outflows.\nCash Flow for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 of $204.9 million was generated principally from increased operating profits, primarily due to the Esselte and PA Acquisitions. Cash generated by incremental operating profits was partially offset by lower contribution from working capital (accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable), payments of professional fees associated with acquisition and integration activities for the Esselte and PA Acquisitions, increased cash taxes and higher pension contributions. For the 2016 year, cash provided by operating activities was $167.1 million. Net income for 2017 was $131.7 million compared to $95.5 million in 2016.\nThe table below shows our cash flow from accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow (used) provided by net working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounts receivable contributed $10.2 million, which was lower than the prior year of $13.4 million due to the timing of the Esselte Acquisition and higher sales in certain foreign markets. Inventory contributed $2.5 million, which was lower than the prior year of $16.7 million due to the Esselte and PA Acquisitions, inventory reductions at certain customers and inventory builds in support of warehouse integration activities. Partially offsetting the cash generated from net working capital were employee annual incentive payments made in the first quarter (including payroll taxes) related to transaction bonuses paid by the seller in connection with the Esselte Acquisition. The settlement of customer program liabilities was lower, primarily driven by lower sales in comparable businesses, partially offset by increased settlements from the Esselte Acquisition. Other significant cash fluctuations included income tax payments of $34.8 million in 2017, which were higher than the $16.9 million paid in 2016 due to higher international taxes, largely related to the Esselte Acquisition, and pension contributions of $21.7 million in 2017, which increased from $6.2 million in 2016 due to higher U.S. contribution requirements and the Esselte Acquisition. Restructuring payments of $13.4 million (primarily associated with headcount reductions and footprint rationalization activities in connection with the integration of Esselte and Pelikan Artline) were higher than the prior-year spend of $4.9 million. Interest payments were $38.0 million, lower than the prior-year payments of $50.1 million due to refinancing activities in late 2016 and lower debt.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nCash used by investing activities was $319.1 million and $106.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The 2017 cash outflow reflects the $292.3 million purchase price, net of cash acquired, paid for Esselte. The 2016 cash outflow reflects the $88.8 million purchase price, net of cash acquired, paid for Pelikan Artline. For further information, see \"Note 3. Acquisitions\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report. Capital expenditures were $31.0 million and $18.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with the increase driven by information technology systems-related investments.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $142.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $76.4 million used for the same period of 2016. Cash provided in 2017 reflects long-term borrowings of $484.1 million, consisting of \u20ac300.0 million (US$320.8 million based on January 27, 2017 exchange rates) in the form of the Euro Term Loan A incurred to fund the Esselte Acquisition, along with additional borrowings of US$91.4 million under the Company's 2017 Revolving Facility, primarily to repay the then existing U.S. Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A in the amount of $81.0 million and to reduce the outstanding balance on the Australian Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A. Additionally, we used $41.8 million for repurchases of our common stock and payments related to tax withholding for stock-based compensation, net of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, and $3.6 million of debt issuance costs associated with the financing of the Esselte Acquisition.\nCash used in 2016 of $76.4 million reflected long-term borrowings of $587.4 million, consisting primarily of a private issuance of New Notes of $400.0 million and an incremental loan in the amount of A$100.0 million (US$76.6 million based on May 2, 2016 exchange rates), along with additional borrowings under the Company's then existing revolving facility, to fund the PA Acquisition. Repayments of long-term debt of $685.1 million primarily reflects the early satisfaction and discharge of our $500 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes, repayments totaling $148.0 million on the then existing U.S. Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A and payment of $24.5 million of debt assumed with the PA Acquisition. In 2016, we also made a \"make-whole\" call premium payment of $25.0 million related to the early satisfaction and discharge of our $500.0 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes, and paid $6.9 million in debt issuance fees in connection with the New Notes.\nCash Flow for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $167.1 million compared to cash provided by the prior-year operating activities of $171.2 million. Net income for 2016 was $95.5 million compared to $85.9 million in 2015. The net operating cash inflow for the 2016 year of $167.1 million was generated by enhanced profitability, improved net working capital management (accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable) and incremental cash flow from the PA Acquisition. Cash outflows in 2016 included an accelerated interest payment of $6.5 million, in association with the early satisfaction and discharge of our senior unsecured notes. Additionally, $11.6 million of cash payments were for transaction and integration costs associated with the Esselte and PA Acquisitions.\nThe table below shows our cash flow from accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively:\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by net working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounts receivable contributed $13.4 million in 2016 due to improved management of year-end collections. Inventory provided cash of $16.7 million as a result of increased real-time inventory purchases earlier in the fourth quarter and improved forecasting, which also contributed to an increased use of cash for accounts payable, which was $19.3 million in 2016, compared to $2.6 million in the prior year. Partially offsetting the cash generated from operating profit and net working capital were significant cash payments related to the settlement of customer program liabilities, which were higher than the prior year due to changes in 2016 customer mix and increased settlements in early 2016 (related to higher year-end 2015 purchases by certain customers to achieve rebate levels). Outflows related to employee annual incentive payments made in the first quarter, underlying interest payments, income tax payments and restructuring cash payments were similar to those made during the prior year.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nCash used by investing activities was $106.4 million and $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 2016 cash outflow reflects the $88.8 million purchase price, net of cash acquired, paid for Pelikan Artline. For further information on the PA Acquisition, see \"Note 3. Acquisition\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report. Capital expenditures were $18.5 million and $27.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The lower capital expenditures in 2016 reflects lower spending on information technology due to the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system in our European operations in the first quarter of 2016.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nCash used by financing activities was $76.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a use of $137.8 million for the same period of 2015. Cash used in 2016 reflected long-term borrowings of $587.4 million, consisting primarily of a private issuance of the New Notes of $400.0 million and incremental Term A loan in the amount of A$100.0 million (US$76.6 million based on May 2, 2016 exchange rates), along with additional borrowings under the Company's existing revolving facility to fund the PA Acquisition. Repayments of long-term debt of $685.1 million primarily reflects the early satisfaction and discharge of our $500 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes, repayments totaling $148.0 million on the then existing U.S. Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A and payment of $24.5 million of debt assumed with the PA Acquisition. In 2016, we also made a \"make-whole\" call premium payment of $25.0 million related to the early satisfaction and discharge of our $500.0 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes, and paid $6.9 million in debt issuance fees in connection with the New Notes. Cash used in 2015 reflected net repayments of long-term debt of $70.1 million and $65.9 million to repurchase the Company's common stock and for payments related to tax withholding for share-based compensation.\nCapitalization\nThe Company had 106.7 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2017.\nAdequacy of Liquidity Sources\nBased on our 2018 business plan and current forecasts, we believe that cash flow from operations, our current cash balance and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings available under our 2017 Revolving Facility, will be adequate to support our requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, to pay dividends and to service indebtedness for the foreseeable future. Our future operating performance is dependent on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. For further information on these risks, see \"Part I, Item1A. Risk Factors - Our significant indebtedness requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to debt payments and limits our ability to engage in certain activities.\"\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Financial Obligations\nThe Company does not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nOur contractual obligations and related payments by period at December 31, 2017 were as follows:\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions of dollars)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019 - 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 - 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>406.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>938.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on debt(1)\n</td> <td>34.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>28.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(2)\n</td> <td>96.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities(3)\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>222.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>218.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>509.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>503.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,454.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Interest calculated at December 31, 2017 rates for variable rate debt.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Purchase obligations primarily consist of contracts and non-cancelable purchase orders for raw materials and finished goods.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Other long-term liabilities consist of estimated expected employer contributions for 2018, along with estimated future payments, for pension and post-retirement plans that are not paid from assets held in a plan trust.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $47.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. For further information, see \"Note 11. Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). Preparation of our financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of actual assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses presented for each reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We regularly review our assumptions and estimates, which are based on historical experience and, where appropriate, current business trends. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which require significant, subjective and complex judgments to be made by our management.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when earned, net of applicable provisions for discounts, returns and allowances. We consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We also provide our estimate of potential bad debt concurrent with recognizing revenue.\nCustomer Program Costs\nCustomer programs and incentives are a common practice in our industry. We incur customer program costs to obtain favorable product placement, to promote sell-through of products and to maintain competitive pricing. Customer program costs and incentives, including rebates, promotional funds and volume allowances, are accounted for as a reduction to gross sales. These costs are recorded at the time of sale based on management's best estimates. Estimates are based on individual customer contracts and projected sales to the customer in comparison to any thresholds indicated by contract. In the absence of a signed contract, estimates are based on historical or projected experience for each program type or customer. Management periodically reviews accruals for these rebates and allowances, and adjusts accruals when circumstances indicate (typically as a result of a change in sales volume expectations or contractual obligations).\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts and Sales Returns\nTrade receivables are recorded at the stated amount, less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations, usually due to a customer's potential insolvency. The allowance includes amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified. In addition, the allowance includes a provision for customer defaults on a general formulaic basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with a specific customer. The assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical experience and existing economic conditions.\nThe allowance for sales returns represents estimated uncollectible receivables associated with the potential return of products previously sold to customers, and is recorded at the same time that the sales are recognized. The allowance includes a general provision for product returns based on historical trends. In addition, the allowance includes a reserve for currently authorized customer returns that are considered to be abnormal in comparison to the historical basis.\nInventories\nInventories are priced at the lower of cost (principally first-in, first-out with minor amounts at average) or net realizable value. Inventory reserves are recorded for obsolete or slow-moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products, the impact of new product introductions and specific identification of items, such as product discontinuance or engineering/material changes. These estimates could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from actual requirements if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe test long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets' carrying amount may not be recoverable from its undiscounted cash flow. When such events occur, we compare the sum of the undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group. The cash flows are based on our best estimate at the time of future cash flow, derived from the most recent business projections. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flow. The discount rate applied to these cash flows is based on our weighted average cost of capital, computed by selecting market rates at the valuation dates for debt and equity that are reflective of the risks associated with an investment in our industry as estimated by using comparable publicly traded companies.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are comprised primarily of indefinite-lived and amortizable intangible assets acquired and arising from the application of purchase accounting. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated at least annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. In addition, amortizable intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives. Certain of our trade names have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these trade names will contribute cash flows to ACCO Brands indefinitely.\nWe test indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment at least annually, normally in the second quarter, and whenever market or business events indicate there may be a potential adverse impact on a particular intangible. The review may be on a qualitative (\"Step-Zero\") or quantitative (\"Step-1\") basis as allowed by GAAP. We consider the implications of both external factors (e.g., market growth, pricing, competition, and technology) and internal factors (e.g., product costs, margins, support expenses, and capital investment) and their potential impact on cash flows in both the near and long term, as well as their impact on any identifiable intangible asset associated with the business. Based on recent business results, consideration of significant external and internal factors, and the resulting business projections, indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed to determine whether they are likely to remain indefinite-lived, or whether a finite life is more appropriate. In addition, based on events in the period and future expectations, management considers whether the potential for impairment exists. Finite lived intangibles are amortized over 10, 15, 23 or 30 years.\nWe performed our annual assessment, on a qualitative basis, as allowed by GAAP, for the majority of our indefinite-lived trade names in the second quarter of 2017 and concluded that no impairment existed. For two of our indefinite-lived trade names that are not substantially above their carrying values, Mead\u00ae and Hilroy\u00ae, we performed Step-1 tests in the second quarter of 2017. The following long-term growth rates and discount rates were used, 1.5% and 10.5% for Mead\u00ae, and 1.5% and 11.0% for Hilroy\u00ae, respectively. We concluded that neither the Mead\u00ae nor Hilroy\u00ae trade names were impaired. The fair value of the Mead\u00ae trade name was less than 30% above its carrying value as of the second quarter of 2017 Step-1 test. As of December 31, 2017, the carrying value of the Mead\u00ae trade name was $113.3 million.\nAs of June 1, 2017, we changed the indefinite-lived Hilroy\u00ae trade name to an amortizable intangible asset. The change was made as a result of decisions regarding the Company's future use of the trade name. The Company commenced amortizing the Hilroy trade name June 1, 2017 on a straight-line basis over a life of 30 years.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill has been recorded on our balance sheet and represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition when compared to the fair value of the net assets acquired. The authoritative guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at a reporting unit level. We have determined that our reporting units are ACCO Brands North America, ACCO Brands EMEA and ACCO Brands International.\nWe test goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. As permitted by GAAP, we may perform a qualitative assessment (\"Step-Zero\") to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test (\"Step-1\") as required by GAAP. We performed our annual assessment in the second quarter of 2017, on a qualitative basis, and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.\nIf the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if it is determined that a qualitative assessment is not appropriate, we move onto the quantitative goodwill (\"Step-1\") impairment test where we calculate the fair value of the reporting units. When applying a fair-value-based test, the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit, goodwill is considered not impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit, an impairment charge is recognized, however, the loss recognized is not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nGiven the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding their impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our qualitative impairment testing during 2017 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or margin growth rates of certain reporting units are not achieved, we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods, whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 or prior to that, if a triggering event is identified outside of the quarter when the annual impairment test is performed. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nWe provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pension, post-retirement, post-employment and health care benefits. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by GAAP, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. Actuarial assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis and modifications to these assumptions are made based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate. As required by GAAP, the effect of our modifications are generally recorded and amortized over future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under the plans are reasonable based on our experience. The actuarial assumptions used to record our plan obligations could differ materially from actual results due to changing economic and market conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or other factors which may impact the amount of retirement-related benefit expense recorded by us in future periods.\nThe discount rate assumptions used to determine the pension and post-retirement obligations of the benefit plans are based on a spot-rate yield curve that matches projected future benefit payments with the appropriate interest rate applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit payments. The assumed discount rates reflect market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. Our discount rates were determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rates reflect the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects management's expectations of long-term average rates of return on funds invested based on our investment profile to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. The expected return is based on the outlook for inflation, fixed income returns and equity returns, while also considering historical returns over the last 10 years, asset allocation and investment strategy.\nWe estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost (income) for pension and post-retirement benefits utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.\nAt the end of each calendar year an actuarial evaluation is performed to determine the funded status of our pension and post-retirement obligations and any actuarial gain or loss is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and then amortized into the income statement in future periods.\nPension income was $4.9 million, $5.3 million and $5.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Post-retirement income was $0.2 million, $0.7 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pension\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Post-retirement\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pension\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Post-retirement\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term rate of return\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2018, we expect pension income of approximately $4.9 million and post-retirement income of approximately $0.2 million.\nA 25-basis point change (0.25%) in our discount rate assumption would lead to an increase or decrease in our pension and post-retirement expense of approximately $0.002 million for 2018. A 25-basis point change (0.25%) in our long-term rate of return assumption would lead to an increase or decrease in pension and post-retirement expense of approximately $1.6 million for 2018.\nPension and post-retirement liabilities of $275.5 million as of December 31, 2017 increased from $98.0 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to the Esselte Acquisition.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax liabilities or assets are established for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Facts and circumstances may change and cause us to revise the conclusions on our ability to realize certain net operating losses and other deferred tax attributes.\nThe amount of income taxes that we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax position is subject to management's assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. We believe that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period any assessments are received, revised or resolved.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Act was signed into law. The U.S. Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to: (i) reducing the future U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (ii) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries; and (iii) bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property.\nThe undistributed earnings of all non-U.S. subsidiaries were approximately $500 million as of December 31, 2017. All of the undistributed earnings have become subject to U.S. income taxes due to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act in 2017. As a result of the U.S. Tax Act, we are analyzing the global working capital and cash requirements, and potential tax liabilities attributable to future repatriation of cash, but we have yet to determine whether we plan to change our prior indefinite investment assertion under ASC 740. We will record the effects of any change in prior assertions in the period in which the change occurs.\nDue to the complexity of the global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") tax rules recently enacted by the U.S. Tax Act, the Company continues to analyze this provision and its impact and the proper application of ASC 740. Under GAAP, the Company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice to either treat the taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred (the \"period cost method\") or factor in such amounts in to the Company's measurement of deferred taxes (the \"deferred method\"). The Company's selection of an accounting policy in connection with GILTI depends upon additional analysis and potential future modifications to the existing structure, which are yet to be known. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any adjustments related to GILTI in our financial statements and has not made a policy choice regarding whether to record deferred taxes on GILTI.\nFor further information on the U.S. Tax Act, see \"Note 11.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of ACCO Brands Corporation and the accompanying notes contained in Item 8. of this report. Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations.\nOverview of the Company\nACCO Brands is a designer, marketer and manufacturer of recognized consumer and end-user demanded brands used in businesses, schools, and homes. Our widely known brands include AT-A-GLANCE\u00ae, Derwent\u00ae, Esselte\u00ae, Five Star\u00ae, GBC\u00ae, Hilroy\u00ae, Kensington\u00ae, Leitz\u00ae, Marbig\u00ae, Mead\u00ae, NOBO\u00ae, Quartet\u00ae, Rapid\u00ae, Rexel\u00ae, Swingline\u00ae, Tilibra\u00ae and Wilson Jones\u00ae. More than 80% of our net sales come from brands that occupy the number one or number two positions in the select product categories in which we compete. We distribute our products through a wide variety of retail and commercial channels to ensure that our products are readily and conveniently available for purchase by consumers and other end-users, wherever they prefer to shop. These channels include mass retailers, e-tailers, discount, drug/grocery and variety chains; warehouse clubs; hardware and specialty stores; independent office product dealers; office superstores; and contract stationers. Our products are sold primarily in the U.S., Europe, Australia, Canada, Brazil and Mexico. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 55% of our sales were outside the U.S., up from 43% in 2016. This increase was the result of the Esselte and Pelikan Artline acquisitions, which further extended our geographic reach.\nOver the past several years we have transformed our business by: divesting certain non-core commercially-oriented product lines; acquiring companies with consumer and end-user demanded brands, and continuing to diversify our distribution channels. In 2012, we acquired the Mead Consumer and Office Products business (\"Mead C&OP\"), which substantially increased our presence in North America and Brazil in school and calendar products with well-known consumer brands. In 2016, we purchased the remaining equity interest in Pelikan Artline from our joint venture partner, which enhanced our competitive position in school and business products in Australia and New Zealand and added new consumer categories, including writing instruments and janitorial supplies. In early 2017, we acquired Esselte Group Holdings AB (\"Esselte\"), which more than doubled our presence in Europe and added several iconic business brands, a significant base of independent dealer customers, and a new product category of do-it-yourself hardware tools. Together these three acquisitions have meaningfully expanded our portfolio of well-known end-user demanded brands, enhanced our competitive position from both a product and channel perspective, and added scale to our business operations.\nToday our Company is a global enterprise focused on developing innovative branded consumer products for use in businesses, schools and homes. We believe our leading product category positions provide the scale to enable us to invest in marketing and product innovation to drive profitable growth. We expect to derive much of our growth, over the long term, in faster-growing emerging geographies such as Latin America and parts of Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe, which exhibit stronger demand for our product categories than in developed markets. In all of our markets we see opportunities to grow sales through share gains, channel expansion and innovative products. We plan to supplement organic growth globally with strategic acquisitions in both existing and adjacent product categories.\nAcquisitions\nEsselte Group Holdings AB Acquisition and Refinancing\nOn January 31, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition (the \"Esselte Acquisition\") of Esselte. Accordingly, the results of Esselte are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from February 1, 2017 forward and are reported in all three of the Company's segments, but primarily in the ACCO Brands EMEA segment. The acquisition of Esselte made ACCO Brands a leading European manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer and office products, and improved ACCO Brands' scale. Esselte products are primarily marketed under the Leitz\u00ae, Rapid\u00ae and Esselte\u00ae brands in the storage and organization, stapling, punching, binding and laminating equipment and do-it-yourself tools product categories.\nThe cash purchase price paid was $292.3 million, net of cash acquired of $34.2 million. In connection with the Esselte Acquisition, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"2017 Credit Agreement\"), dated as of January 27, 2017. The 2017 Credit Agreement provides for a five-year senior secured credit facility, which consists of a \u20ac300.0 million (US$320.8 million based on January 27, 2017 exchange rates) term loan facility (the \"Euro Term Loan A\"), a A$80.0 million (US$60.4 million based on January 27, 2017 exchange rates) term loan facility (the \"AUD Term Loan A\"), and a\nUS$400.0 million multi-currency revolving credit facility (the \"2017 Revolving Facility\").\nPelikan Artline Joint-Venture Acquisition\nOn May 2, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Australia Stationery Industries, Inc. (the \"PA Acquisition\"), which indirectly owned the 50% of the Pelikan Artline joint-venture and the issued capital stock of Pelikan Artline Pty Limited (collectively, \"Pelikan Artline\") that was not already owned by the Company. Prior to the PA Acquisition, the Pelikan Artline joint-venture was accounted for using the equity method. The results of Pelikan Artline are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from May 2, 2016 forward, and are reported in the ACCO Brands International segment. Accordingly, we no longer separately report equity in earnings from this joint-venture. Pelikan Artline is a premier distributor of recognized consumer brands used in businesses, schools, and homes in Australia and New Zealand.\nFor further information on the acquisitions, see \"Note 3. Acquisitions\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report. For information on the financings of the acquisitions, see \"Note 4. Long-term Debt and Short-term Borrowings\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nReportable Segments\nEffective in the first quarter of 2017, as a result of the Esselte Acquisition, the Company realigned its operating structure, which affected the makeup of its business segments for financial reporting purposes. The Company has three operating business segments each of which is comprised of different geographic regions. The Company no longer reports the results of its Computer Products Group as a separate segment. Results of the former Computer Products Group are reflected in the appropriate geographic segment based on the region from which sales are made. The Company's three realigned business segments are as follows:\n\nWe have restated our financial statements for each of the periods presented to reflect this change in reportable business segments.\nEach of the Company's three operating segments designs, markets, sources, manufactures and sells recognized consumer and end-user demanded brands used in businesses, schools and homes. Product designs are tailored based on end-user preferences in each geographic region.\nOur product categories include storage and organization; stapling; punching; laminating, binding and shredding machines and related consumable supplies; whiteboards; notebooks; calendars; computer accessories; and do-it-yourself tools, among others. Our portfolio of consumer and end-user demanded brands includes both globally and regionally recognized brands.\nACCO Brands markets and sells its strong multi-product offering broadly and is not dependent on any one channel. Our products are sold through all relevant channels, namely retailers, including: mass retailers; e-tailers; discount, drug/grocery and variety chains; warehouse clubs; hardware and specialty stores; independent office product dealers; office superstores; and contract stationers. We also sell directly to commercial and consumer end-users through our e-commerce platform and our direct sales organization.\nFor further information on our business segments see \"Note 16. Information on Business Segments\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report.\nOverview of 2017 Performance\nOur financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflect the significant benefit of our acquisitions. The Esselte Acquisition and the PA Acquisition primarily impact the financial results of our EMEA and International segments, respectively. For more information, see \"Note 3. Acquisitions\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nThe Company's cash flow from operations, effective tax rate and interest payments were impacted by the refinancing of our senior unsecured notes in December 2016 to obtain a lower interest rate, and the increase in our bank debt in January 2017 to finance the Esselte Acquisition. For further information, see \"Note 4. Long-term Debt and Short-term Borrowings\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nIn addition, we recorded a tax benefit of $25.7 million related to the newly passed U.S Tax Act in December of 2017. For further information, see \"Note 11. Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nForeign currency translation also impacted our consolidated financial statements favorably for the year ended December 31, 2017. Where necessary, we adjust sales prices to cover the impacts of currency fluctuation on our cost of goods sold and take currency positions to allow for the time needed to generally achieve the sales price adjustments.\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n\n (1) The Company acquired Esselte on January 31, 2017; Esselte's results are included in 2017 results from February 1, 2017 forward. \n (2) The Company acquired Pelikan Artline on May 2, 2016; Pelikan Artline's results are included in 2016 results from that date forward. \nNet Sales\nNet sales of $1,948.8 million, including $438.8 million attributable to the Esselte and PA Acquisitions, were up $391.7 million, or 25%, from $1,557.1 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased sales by $12.4 million, or 1% in the current-year period. Comparable net sales, excluding the acquisitions and foreign currency translation, were down primarily due to declines at certain office superstore customers and lost product placements.\nCost of Products Sold\nCost of products sold includes all manufacturing, product sourcing and distribution costs, including depreciation related to assets used in the manufacturing, procurement and distribution processes, allocation of certain information technology costs supporting those processes, inbound and outbound freight, shipping and handling costs, purchasing costs associated with materials and packaging used in the production processes and inventory valuation adjustments. Cost of products sold of $1,292.4 million, was up $250.4 million, or 24%, from $1,042.0 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced cost of\nproducts sold by $8.4 million, or 1% in the current-year period. Underlying cost of products sold, excluding foreign currency translation, increased due to the inclusion of the acquisitions, partially offset by lower comparable sales and cost savings and productivity improvements.\nGross Profit\nWe believe that gross profit and gross profit margin provide enhanced shareholder appreciation of underlying profit drivers. Gross profit of $656.4 million, was up $141.3 million, or 27%, from $515.1 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased gross profit by $4.0 million, or 1% in the current-year period. Underlying gross profit, excluding foreign currency translation, increased due to the inclusion of the acquisitions, together with productivity initiatives and higher pricing, which was partially offset by lower comparable sales and inflation.\nGross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 33.7% from 33.1%. The increase was primarily due to productivity improvements and higher pricing.\nSelling, General and Administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") include advertising, marketing, selling (including commissions), research and development, customer service, depreciation related to assets outside the manufacturing and distribution processes, and all other general and administrative expenses outside the manufacturing and distribution functions (e.g., finance, human resources, information technology and corporate expenses). SG&A of $406.1 million, was up $85.3 million, or 27%, from $320.8 million in the prior-year period. The current-year period includes $16.4 million of integration and transaction costs related to the acquisitions. The prior-year period included $12.8 million in transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions. Foreign currency translation increased SG&A by $0.6 million, or 0.2%, in the current-year period. Underlying SG&A, excluding integration and transaction costs and foreign currency translation, increased primarily due to the inclusion of the acquisitions.\nAs a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased to 20.8% from 20.6% in the prior-year period, primarily due to higher integration and transaction costs incurred in the current-year period, partially offset by productivity initiatives.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nAmortization of intangibles of $35.6 million, was up $14.0 million, or 65%, from $21.6 million in the prior-year period. The increase was due to the inclusion of the Esselte and PA Acquisitions.\nRestructuring Charges\nRestructuring charges in the current-year period of $21.7 million related primarily to the integrations of Esselte and Pelikan Artline. Restructuring charges in the prior-year period of $5.4 million related primarily to the integration of Pelikan Artline and consolidation of certain functions in the North America segment.\nOperating Income\nOperating income of $193.0 million, was up $25.7 million, or 15%, from $167.3 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $3.2 million, or 2%, in the current-year period. Underlying operating income, excluding restructuring, transaction and integration costs, and foreign currency translation, increased primarily due to the inclusion of the acquisitions.\nInterest Expense, Equity in Earnings of Joint Venture and Other (Income) Expense, Net\nInterest expense of $41.1 million, was down $8.2 million, or 17%, from $49.3 million in the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to the lower interest rate paid on our senior unsecured notes, which were refinanced in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by interest resulting from increased debt incurred in connection with the Esselte Acquisition. The prior-year period included $2.5 million of incremental interest expense related to the above-referenced refinancing of our senior unsecured notes and the accelerated amortization of debt issuance cost related to the prepayment of $70 million on our U.S. Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A.\nAs a result of the PA Acquisition, which was completed on May 2, 2016, equity in earnings of joint venture decreased $2.1 million as the Company ceased accounting for the Pelikan Artline joint-venture using the equity method of accounting.\nOther (income) expense, net was income of $0.4 million compared to expense of $1.4 million in the prior-year period. The current-year period included a $2.3 million foreign currency gain related to the settlement of certain intercompany loan transactions. The prior-year period included charges associated with the refinancing of our senior unsecured notes. These charges consisted of $25.0 million in a \"make-whole\" call premium and a $4.9 million charge for the write-off of debt issuance costs, which were offset by a $28.9 million non-cash gain arising from the PA Acquisition due to the revaluation of the Company's previously held equity interest to fair value and a gain on the settlement of an intercompany loan of $1.0 million, previously deemed permanently invested.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the current-year period, income tax expense was $26.4 million on income before taxes of $158.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 16.7%. The low effective tax rate for the current-year period is primarily due to a net tax benefit of $25.7 million related to the newly passed U.S. Tax Act in December of 2017. This benefit was driven by the reduction of net deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings (the \"Transition Toll Tax\"). For further information on the impact of the U.S. Tax Act, see \"Note 11. Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report. Also contributing to the low effective rate was $5.6 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation related to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. See \"Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report for details on the adoption of this new standard.\nFor the prior-year period, income tax expense was $29.6 million on income before taxes of $125.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 23.7%. The low effective tax rate in the prior-year period was primarily due to the following: 1) the $28.9 million gain arising from the PA Acquisition due to the revaluation of the previously held equity interest to fair value, which was not subject to tax, and 2) tax losses on foreign exchange on the repayment of intercompany loans, for which the pre-tax effect was recorded in equity.\nNet Income\nNet income of $131.7 million, was up $36.2 million, or 38%, from $95.5 million in the prior-year period. Diluted income per share was $1.19, up $0.32, or 37% from $0.87 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased net income by $5.9 million, or 6% in the current-year period. The increase in net income was primarily due to inclusion of the acquisitions, lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate.\nSegment Net Sales and Operating Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n\n (1) Segment operating income excludes corporate costs: \"Interest expense;\" \"Interest income;\" \"Equity in earnings of joint-venture\" and \"Other (income) expense, net.\" See \"Note 16. Information on Business Segments\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report for a reconciliation of total \"Segment operating income\" to \"Income before income tax.\" \nACCO Brands North America\nACCO Brands North America net sales of $999.0 million, including $13.4 million attributable to the Esselte Acquisition, were down $17.1 million, or 2%, from $1,016.1 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased sales by $2.0 million, or 0.2%, in the current-year period. Comparable net sales, excluding Esselte and foreign currency translation, decreased primarily due to continued declines with office superstore customers and lost product placements with certain customers. Sales during the back-to-school season were down slightly compared to the prior year, which had strong growth.\nACCO Brands North America operating income of $155.6 million, was up $2.3 million, or 2%, from $153.3 million in the prior-year period, and operating income as a percent of net sales increased to 15.6% from 15.1%. The increase was due to higher gross margins from cost savings and productivity initiatives, and reduced customer sales rebates, which were partially offset by lower comparable sales, higher go-to-market spending and $5.5 million in restructuring charges (versus $1.1 million in the prior-year period). The restructuring charges related to the realignment of the operating structure of our former Computer Products Group, the Esselte integration and other projects to enhance the future long-term performance of the business.\nACCO Brands EMEA\nACCO Brands EMEA net sales of $542.8 million, including approximately $388 million attributable to the Esselte Acquisition, were up $371.0 million, or 216%, from $171.8 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased sales by $0.8 million, or 0.5%, in the current-year period. Comparable net sales, excluding Esselte and foreign currency translation, decreased due to lost product placements and inventory reductions by certain customers.\nACCO Brands EMEA operating income of $37.1 million, including approximately $24.9 million attributable to the Esselte Acquisition, was up $24.5 million, or 194%, from $12.6 million in the prior-year period, but operating income as a percent of net sales decreased to 6.8% from 7.3%. The increase in operating income was driven by the Esselte Acquisition and includes restructuring costs of $11.2 million, integration costs of $5.5 million, and the amortization of step-up in the value of finished goods inventory of $0.8 million. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $2.4 million in the current-year period. Underlying operating income, excluding Esselte, restructuring and integration costs, foreign currency translation and the amortization of step-up in the value of finished goods inventory, decreased due to lower comparable sales, partially offset by reduced SG&A expenses.\nOperating income as a percent of sales decreased due to restructuring and integration costs, higher intangible amortization resulting from the Esselte Acquisition and lower gross margins (primarily due to Esselte having lower margins than the legacy ACCO business), partially offset by the lower SG&A margins in the legacy Esselte business.\nACCO Brands International\nACCO Brands International net sales of $407.0 million, including $37.9 million attributable to the PA and Esselte Acquisitions, were up $37.8 million, or 10%, from $369.2 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased sales by $9.6 million, or 3% in the current-year period. Comparable net sales, excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translation, decreased primarily due to lost product placements and inventory reductions in Australia, partially offset by higher sales in Brazil and Mexico.\nACCO Brands International operating income of $50.9 million, was up $1.5 million, or 3%, from $49.4 million in the prior-year period, but operating income as a percent of net sales decreased to 12.5% from 13.4%. Restructuring and integration costs in the current-year period were $5.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively. In addition, the current-year period includes a $1.5 million gain on the sale of a distribution center in New Zealand related to the integration of Pelikan Artline. The prior-year period includes restructuring costs of $4.3 million, integration costs of $2.3 million and the amortization of the step-up in value of the finished goods inventory of $0.4 million. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $0.7 million in the current-year period. Underlying operating income, excluding restructuring and integration costs, the amortization of step-up in the value of finished goods inventory, the gain on sale of the distribution center and foreign currency translation, was flat due to the inclusion of the results of Pelikan Artline in the current-year period and improved profitability in Brazil and Mexico, which was offset by lower comparable net sales and higher distribution costs associated with the warehouse and IT system consolidation in Australia.\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\n\n (1) The Company acquired Pelikan Artline on May 2, 2016; the results of which are included in 2016 results from that date forward. \nNet Sales\nNet sales of $1,557.1 million, including $78.5 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, were up $46.7 million, or 3%, from $1,510.4 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced net sales by $16.9 million, or 1%. Comparable net sales, excluding Pelikan Artline and foreign currency translation, were down due to declines at certain wholesalers and office superstores customers, partially offset by strong growth at mass and e-tail customers.\nCost of Products Sold\nCost of products sold of $1,042.0 million, including $47.7 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, was up $10.0 million, or 1%, from $1,032.0 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation decreased cost of products sold by $13.3 million, or 1%. Underlying cost of products sold, excluding Pelikan Artline and foreign currency translation, decreased due to lower sales volume and productivity improvements, partially offset by foreign-exchange-related inflationary increases in certain foreign markets' cost of products sold.\nGross Profit\nGross profit of $515.1 million, including $30.8 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, was up $36.7 million, or 8%, from $478.4 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation decreased gross profit by $3.6 million, or 1%. Underlying gross profit, excluding Pelikan Artline and foreign currency translation, increased due to higher pricing and productivity improvements, which were partially offset by foreign-exchange-related inflationary increases in certain foreign markets' costs of products sold.\nGross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 33.1% from 31.7% in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to cost savings and productivity improvements, higher pricing and the positive impact of the PA Acquisition.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A of $320.8 million, including $16.6 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, was up $25.1 million, or 8%, from $295.7 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced SG&A by $4.8 million, or 2%. The prior-year period included $3.6 million of integration and transaction costs related to the PA Acquisition. Underlying SG&A, excluding Pelikan Artline and foreign currency translation, increased, driven by higher professional fees, including $9.2 million of transaction costs related to the Esselte Acquisition. Additionally, the prior-year period benefited from a one-time $2.3 million recovery of an indirect tax in Brazil.\nAs a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased to 20.6% from 19.6% in the prior-year period for the reasons mentioned above.\nRestructuring Charges (Credits)\nWe initiated cost reduction plans related to the consolidation and integration of Pelikan Artline with our already existing Australian and New Zealand businesses and, as a result, incurred $4.2 million of charges in 2016, primarily related to severance. In addition, in 2016 we initiated additional cost reduction plans and incurred $1.2 million of severance charges related to the consolidation of certain functions in the North America segment.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nAmortization of intangibles was $21.6 million, up $2.0 million, or 10%, from $19.6 million in the prior-year period. The increase was due to the inclusion due to the PA Acquisition.\nOperating Income\nOperating income of $167.3 million, including $5.6 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, was up $3.8 million, or 2%, from $163.5 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $1.6 million, or 1%. Underlying operating income, excluding the PA Acquisition and foreign currency translation, decreased primarily due to increased SG&A.\nInterest Expense and Other Expense, Net\nInterest expense of $49.3 million, was up $4.8 million, or 11%, from $44.5 million in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to additional debt incurred to finance the PA Acquisition and the refinancing of our senior unsecured notes which resulted in the payment of $2.5 million of incremental interest expense. Also contributing to the increase was the accelerated amortization of debt issuance cost related to the prepayment of $70 million on our U.S. Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A.\nOther expense, net of $1.4 million was down $0.7 million from $2.1 million in the prior-year period. The 2016 year included charges associated with the above referenced refinancing of our senior unsecured notes. These charges consisted of $25.0 million in a \"make-whole\" call premium and a $4.9 million charge for the write-off of debt issuance costs, which were offset by a $28.9 million non-cash gain arising from the PA Acquisition due to the revaluation of the Company's previously held equity interest to fair value and a gain on the settlement of an intercompany loan of $1.0 million, previously deemed permanently invested. In the prior-year period we wrote-off $1.9 million of debt issuance costs related to the refinancing completed in 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $29.6 million on income before taxes of $125.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 23.7%. For the prior-year period, income tax expense was $45.5 million on income before taxes of $131.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 34.6%. The low effective tax rate in 2016 was primarily due to the following: 1) the $28.9 million non-cash gain arising from the PA Acquisition due to the revaluation of the previously held equity interest to fair value, which was not subject to tax, and 2) tax losses on foreign exchange on the repayment of intercompany loans, for which the pre-tax effect was recorded in equity.\nNet Income\nNet income was $95.5 million, up $9.6 million, or 11%, from $85.9 million in the prior-year period. Diluted income per share was $0.87, up $0.09, or 12% from $0.78 per diluted share in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to the lower effective tax rate in 2016.\nSegment Net Sales and Operating Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\n\n (1) Segment operating income excludes corporate costs: \"Interest expense;\" \"Interest income;\" \"Equity in earnings of joint-venture\" and \"Other (income) expense, net.\" See \"Note 16. Information on Business Segments\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report for a reconciliation of total \"Segment operating income\" to \"Income before income tax.\" \nACCO Brands North America\nACCO Brands North America net sales of $1,016.1 million, were down $9.6 million, or 1%, from $1,025.7 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by $4.1 million, or 0.4%. Comparable net sales, excluding foreign currency translation, decreased due to declines at certain wholesalers and an office products superstore due to inventory reductions and consumers purchasing in different channels. The net sales decline was partially offset by strong back-to-school sales, notably with mass-market customers and e-tailers, due to increased product placements and broadened product offerings.\nACCO Brands North America operating income of $153.3 million, was up $1.7 million, or 1%, from $151.6 million in the prior-year period. Operating income as a percent of net sales increased to 15.1% from 14.8% in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation decreased operating income by $0.4 million, or 0.2%. Underlying operating income, excluding foreign currency translation, increased due to productivity improvements.\nACCO Brands EMEA\nACCO Brands EMEA net sales of $171.8 million, were down $27.9 million, or 14%, from $199.7 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by $8.6 million, or 4%. Comparable net sales, excluding foreign currency translation, decreased due to lower volume as a result of the ongoing inventory reductions, as well as lost share with some customers and lower consumer demand, partially offset by price increases that were implemented to recover gross margins following foreign-exchange-related cost of products sold increases.\nACCO Brands EMEA operating income of $12.6 million, was down $5.4 million, or 30% from $18.0 million in the prior-year period. Operating income as a percent of net sales decreased to 7.3% from 9.0% in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $0.3 million. Underlying operating income, excluding foreign currency translation, decreased primarily due to lower comparable net sales, partially offset by higher gross margins.\nACCO Brands International\nACCO Brands International net sales of $369.2 million, including $78.5 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, were up $84.2 million, or 30%, from $285.0 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by $4.2 million,\nor 1%. Comparable net sales, excluding Pelikan Artline and foreign currency translation, increased due to higher pricing, which benefited sales by 9%. Price increases were implemented to recover gross margins following foreign-exchange-related cost of products sold increases, in Australia and Mexico, as well as to offset paper related inflation in Brazil. Partially offsetting the price increases were volume declines, primarily in the legacy ACCO Brands Australian business.\nACCO Brands International operating income of $49.4 million, including $6.9 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, increased $20.3 million, or 70%, from $29.1 million in the prior-year period, and operating income as a percent of net sales increased to 13.4% from 10.2% in the prior-year period. Pelikan Artline operating income of $6.9 million includes restructuring costs of $4.2 million and integration costs of $2.3 million. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $1.7 million, or 6%, due to the recovery of the Brazilian real, which occurred in the seasonally stronger fourth quarter. Underlying operating income, excluding Pelikan Artline and foreign currency translation, increased due to higher pricing and productivity improvements, partially offset by lower volumes. In addition, the prior-year period included a one-time $2.3 million recovery of an indirect tax and $1.3 million of severance charges, both in Brazil.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary liquidity needs are to service indebtedness, fund capital expenditures and support working capital requirements. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents held and seasonal borrowings under our 2017 Revolving Facility. As of December 31, 2017, there was $133.9 million in borrowings outstanding under our $400.0 million 2017 Revolving Facility and the amount available for borrowings was $255.0 million (allowing for $11.1 million of letters of credit outstanding on that date).\nWe maintain adequate financing arrangements at market rates. Because of the seasonality of our business, we typically generate much of our cash flow in the first, third and fourth quarters, as accounts receivables are collected, and we use cash in the second quarter to fund working capital in order to support the North America back-to-school season. Our Brazilian business is highly seasonal due to the timing of the back-to-school season, which coincides with the calendar year-end in the fourth quarter. Due to various tax laws, it is costly to transfer short-term working capital in and out of Brazil; therefore, our normal practice is to hold seasonal cash requirements in Brazil, and invest in short-term Brazilian government securities. Consolidated cash and cash equivalents was $76.9 million as of December 31, 2017, approximately $31 million of which was held in Brazil.\nOn February 12, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved the initiation of a cash dividend program under which the Company will pay a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share on its common stock ($0.24 per share on an annualized basis). In addition, on February 14, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved an authorization to repurchase up to an additional $100 million in shares of its common stock. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $84.0 million remaining of its prior authorizations.\nOur priorities for cash flow use over the near term, after funding business operations, including restructuring expenditures, are debt reduction, dividends, stock repurchases and to fund strategic acquisitions.\nThe current senior secured credit facilities had a weighted average interest rate of 3.48% as of December 31, 2017 and our senior unsecured notes have a fixed interest rate of 5.25%.\nDebt Amendments and Refinancing\nThird Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\nIn connection with the Esselte Acquisition, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"2017 Credit Agreement\"), dated as of January 27, 2017, among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other agents and various lenders party thereto. The 2017 Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company's Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated April 28, 2015 (the \"2015 Credit Agreement\").\nThe 2017 Credit Agreement provides a five-year senior secured credit facility, which consists of a \u20ac300 million (US$320.8 million based on January 27, 2017 exchange rates) term loan facility (the \"Euro Term Loan A\"), a A$80 million (US$60.4 million based on January 27, 2017 exchange rates) term loan facility (the \"AUD Term Loan A\" and, together with the Euro Term Loan A, the \"2017 Term A Loan Facility\"), and a US$400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility (the \"2017 Revolving Facility\").\nMaturity and Amortization\nBorrowings under the 2017 Revolving Facility and the 2017 Term A Loan Facility mature on January 27, 2022. Amounts under the 2017 Revolving Facility are non-amortizing. Beginning June 30, 2017, the outstanding principal amounts under the 2017 Term A Loan Facility are payable in quarterly installments in an amount representing, on an annual basis, 5.0% of the initial aggregate principal amount of such loan facility and increasing to 12.5% on an annual basis by June 30, 2020.\nInterest rates\nAmounts outstanding under the 2017 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Euro Rate with a 0% floor, the Australian BBSR Rate, the Canadian BA Rate or the Base Rate, as applicable and as each such rate is defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement, plus an \"applicable rate.\" The applicable rate applied to outstanding Euro, Australian and Canadian dollar denominated loans and Base Rate loans is based on the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement) as follows:\n\nAs of December 31, 2017, the applicable rate on Euro, Australian and Canadian dollar loans was 1.50% and the applicable rate on Base Rate loans was 0.50%. Undrawn amounts under the 2017 Revolving Facility are subject to a commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.40% per annum, depending on the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio. As of December 31, 2017, the commitment fee rate was 0.30%.\nPrepayments\nSubject to certain conditions and specific exceptions, the 2017 Credit Agreement requires the Company to prepay outstanding amounts under the 2017 Credit Agreement under various circumstances, including (a) if sales or dispositions of certain property or assets in any fiscal year results in the receipt of net cash proceeds of $12.0 million, then an amount equal to 100% of the net cash proceeds received in excess of such $12.0 million, and (b) with respect to the AUD Term Loan A, in an amount equal to 100% of the net cash proceeds received from the disposition of any real property located in Australia. The Company also would be required to make prepayments in the event it receives proceeds related to certain property insurance or condemnation awards, from additional debt other than debt permitted under the 2017 Credit Agreement and from excess cash flow as determined under the 2017 Credit Agreement. The 2017 Credit Agreement also contains other customary prepayment obligations and provides for voluntary commitment reductions and prepayment of loans, subject to certain conditions and exceptions.\nDividends and Share Repurchases\nUnder the 2017 Credit Agreement, the Company may pay dividends and/or repurchase shares in an aggregate amount not to exceed the sum of: (i) the greater of $30 million and 1.00% of the Company's Consolidated Total Assets (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement); plus (ii) an additional amount not to exceed $75.0 million in any fiscal year (provided the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio after giving pro forma effect to the restricted payment would be greater than 2.50:1.00 and less than or equal to 3.75:1.00); plus (iii) an additional amount so long as the Consolidated Leverage Ratio after giving pro forma effect to the restricted payment would be less than or equal to 2.50:1.00; plus (iv) any Net Equity Proceeds (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement).\nFinancial Covenants\nThe Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter may not exceed 3.75:1.00; provided that following the consummation of a Material Acquisition (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement), and as of the end of the fiscal quarter in which such Material Acquisition occurred and as of the end of the three fiscal quarters thereafter, the maximum\nConsolidated Leverage Ratio level above will increase by 0.50:1.00, provided that no more than one such increase can be in effect at any time. The Esselte Acquisition qualified as a Material Acquisition under the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nThe 2017 Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement) as of the end of any fiscal quarter at or above 1.25 to 1.00.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 2.6 to 1 and our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio was approximately 5.3 to 1.\nOther Covenants and Restrictions\nThe 2017 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults, certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, certain ERISA-related events, changes in control or ownership and invalidity of any loan document. The 2017 Credit Agreement also establishes limitations on the aggregate amount of Permitted Acquisitions and Investments (each as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement) that the Company and its subsidiaries may make during the term of the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nAs of and for the periods ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all applicable loan covenants.\nGuarantees and Security\nGenerally, obligations under the 2017 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Company's existing and future subsidiaries, and are secured by substantially all of the Company's and certain guarantor subsidiaries' assets, subject to certain exclusions and limitations.\nIncremental Facilities\nThe 2017 Credit Agreement permits the Company to seek increases in the size of the 2017 Revolving Facility and the 2017 Term A Loan Facility prior to maturity by up to $500.0 million in the aggregate, subject to lender commitment and the conditions set forth in the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nSenior Unsecured Notes due December 2024\nOn December 22, 2016, the Company completed a private offering of $400.0 million in senior unsecured notes, due December 2024 (the \"New Notes\"), which bear interest at 5.25%. Net proceeds from the sale of the New Notes, together with borrowings of $73.9 million under the Company's revolving credit facility and cash on hand, were used to redeem the then existing senior unsecured notes (the \"Old Notes\"). The aggregate redemption price of $531.5 million consisted of principal due and payable on the Old Notes, a \"make-whole\" call premium of $25.0 million (included in \"Other (income) expense, net\"), and accrued and unpaid interest of $6.5 million (included in \"Interest expense\") which the Company irrevocably deposited with the trustee of the Old Notes thereby satisfying all its obligations related to the Old Notes.\nAlso included in \"Other expense, net\" is a $4.9 million charge for the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the Old Notes. Additionally, we incurred and capitalized approximately $6.1 million in bank, legal and other fees associated with the issuance of the New Notes.\nRestructuring and Integration Activities\nFrom time to time the Company may implement restructuring, realignment or cost-reduction plans and activities, including those related to integrating acquired businesses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an aggregate $21.7 million in restructuring expenses primarily related to the integration of the ACCO Brands and Esselte operations worldwide. The remaining charges relate to the integration of ACCO Brands and Pelikan Artline operations in Australia and New Zealand, and the change in the operating structure in North America, including integration of our former Computer Products Group into our remaining business segments. As of December 31, 2017, there was $13.3 million remaining of restructuring liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. For further information, see \"Note 10. Restructuring\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an aggregate $11.4 million in non-restructuring integration expenses related to the integration of the ACCO Brands and Esselte and Pelikan Artline operations.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company approved additional restructuring projects aggregating to $3.5 million, primarily related to changes to the structure in the ACCO Brands North America segment and the continued integration of Esselte in the ACCO Brands EMEA segment. In accordance with GAAP, none of the aforementioned liabilities were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nConsistent with our previous communications about the Esselte Acquisition, the Company currently expects it will record approximately $4 million for integration activities and $4 million of incremental restructuring expenses during the remainder of 2018, which is in addition to the $3.5 million of restructuring projects approved during the first quarter of 2018. As integration plans are still being finalized, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the nature or timing of these restructuring and integration charges or the timing of their associated cash outflows.\nCash Flow for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 of $204.9 million was generated principally from increased operating profits, primarily due to the Esselte and PA Acquisitions. Cash generated by incremental operating profits was partially offset by lower contribution from working capital (accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable), payments of professional fees associated with acquisition and integration activities for the Esselte and PA Acquisitions, increased cash taxes and higher pension contributions. For the 2016 year, cash provided by operating activities was $167.1 million. Net income for 2017 was $131.7 million compared to $95.5 million in 2016.\nThe table below shows our cash flow from accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively:\n\nAccounts receivable contributed $10.2 million, which was lower than the prior year of $13.4 million due to the timing of the Esselte Acquisition and higher sales in certain foreign markets. Inventory contributed $2.5 million, which was lower than the prior year of $16.7 million due to the Esselte and PA Acquisitions, inventory reductions at certain customers and inventory builds in support of warehouse integration activities. Partially offsetting the cash generated from net working capital were employee annual incentive payments made in the first quarter (including payroll taxes) related to transaction bonuses paid by the seller in connection with the Esselte Acquisition. The settlement of customer program liabilities was lower, primarily driven by lower sales in comparable businesses, partially offset by increased settlements from the Esselte Acquisition. Other significant cash fluctuations included income tax payments of $34.8 million in 2017, which were higher than the $16.9 million paid in 2016 due to higher international taxes, largely related to the Esselte Acquisition, and pension contributions of $21.7 million in 2017, which increased from $6.2 million in 2016 due to higher U.S. contribution requirements and the Esselte Acquisition. Restructuring payments of $13.4 million (primarily associated with headcount reductions and footprint rationalization activities in connection with the integration of Esselte and Pelikan Artline) were higher than the prior-year spend of $4.9 million. Interest payments were $38.0 million, lower than the prior-year payments of $50.1 million due to refinancing activities in late 2016 and lower debt.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nCash used by investing activities was $319.1 million and $106.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The 2017 cash outflow reflects the $292.3 million purchase price, net of cash acquired, paid for Esselte. The 2016 cash outflow reflects the $88.8 million purchase price, net of cash acquired, paid for Pelikan Artline. For further information, see \"Note 3. Acquisitions\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report. Capital expenditures were $31.0 million and $18.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with the increase driven by information technology systems-related investments.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $142.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $76.4 million used for the same period of 2016. Cash provided in 2017 reflects long-term borrowings of $484.1 million, consisting of \u20ac300.0 million (US$320.8 million based on January 27, 2017 exchange rates) in the form of the Euro Term Loan A incurred to fund the Esselte Acquisition, along with additional borrowings of US$91.4 million under the Company's 2017 Revolving Facility, primarily to repay the then existing U.S. Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A in the amount of $81.0 million and to reduce the outstanding balance on the Australian Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A. Additionally, we used $41.8 million for repurchases of our common stock and payments related to tax withholding for stock-based compensation, net of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, and $3.6 million of debt issuance costs associated with the financing of the Esselte Acquisition.\nCash used in 2016 of $76.4 million reflected long-term borrowings of $587.4 million, consisting primarily of a private issuance of New Notes of $400.0 million and an incremental loan in the amount of A$100.0 million (US$76.6 million based on May 2, 2016 exchange rates), along with additional borrowings under the Company's then existing revolving facility, to fund the PA Acquisition. Repayments of long-term debt of $685.1 million primarily reflects the early satisfaction and discharge of our $500 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes, repayments totaling $148.0 million on the then existing U.S. Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A and payment of $24.5 million of debt assumed with the PA Acquisition. In 2016, we also made a \"make-whole\" call premium payment of $25.0 million related to the early satisfaction and discharge of our $500.0 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes, and paid $6.9 million in debt issuance fees in connection with the New Notes.\nCash Flow for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $167.1 million compared to cash provided by the prior-year operating activities of $171.2 million. Net income for 2016 was $95.5 million compared to $85.9 million in 2015. The net operating cash inflow for the 2016 year of $167.1 million was generated by enhanced profitability, improved net working capital management (accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable) and incremental cash flow from the PA Acquisition. Cash outflows in 2016 included an accelerated interest payment of $6.5 million, in association with the early satisfaction and discharge of our senior unsecured notes. Additionally, $11.6 million of cash payments were for transaction and integration costs associated with the Esselte and PA Acquisitions.\nThe table below shows our cash flow from accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively:\n\nAccounts receivable contributed $13.4 million in 2016 due to improved management of year-end collections. Inventory provided cash of $16.7 million as a result of increased real-time inventory purchases earlier in the fourth quarter and improved forecasting, which also contributed to an increased use of cash for accounts payable, which was $19.3 million in 2016, compared to $2.6 million in the prior year. Partially offsetting the cash generated from operating profit and net working capital were significant cash payments related to the settlement of customer program liabilities, which were higher than the prior year due to changes in 2016 customer mix and increased settlements in early 2016 (related to higher year-end 2015 purchases by certain customers to achieve rebate levels). Outflows related to employee annual incentive payments made in the first quarter, underlying interest payments, income tax payments and restructuring cash payments were similar to those made during the prior year.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nCash used by investing activities was $106.4 million and $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 2016 cash outflow reflects the $88.8 million purchase price, net of cash acquired, paid for Pelikan Artline. For further information on the PA Acquisition, see \"Note 3. Acquisition\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report. Capital expenditures were $18.5 million and $27.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The lower capital expenditures in 2016 reflects lower spending on information technology due to the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system in our European operations in the first quarter of 2016.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nCash used by financing activities was $76.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a use of $137.8 million for the same period of 2015. Cash used in 2016 reflected long-term borrowings of $587.4 million, consisting", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of ACCO Brands Corporation and the accompanying notes contained in Item 8. of this report. Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations.\nOverview of the Company\nACCO Brands is a designer, marketer and manufacturer of recognized consumer and end-user demanded brands used in businesses, schools, and homes. Our widely known brands include AT-A-GLANCE\u00ae, Derwent\u00ae, Esselte\u00ae, Five Star\u00ae, GBC\u00ae, Hilroy\u00ae, Kensington\u00ae, Leitz\u00ae, Marbig\u00ae, Mead\u00ae, NOBO\u00ae, Quartet\u00ae, Rapid\u00ae, Rexel\u00ae, Swingline\u00ae, Tilibra\u00ae and Wilson Jones\u00ae. More than 80% of our net sales come from brands that occupy the number one or number two positions in the select product categories in which we compete. We distribute our products through a wide variety of retail and commercial channels to ensure that our products are readily and conveniently available for purchase by consumers and other end-users, wherever they prefer to shop. These channels include mass retailers, e-tailers, discount, drug/grocery and variety chains; warehouse clubs; hardware and specialty stores; independent office product dealers; office superstores; and contract stationers. Our products are sold primarily in the U.S., Europe, Australia, Canada, Brazil and Mexico. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 55% of our sales were outside the U.S., up from 43% in 2016. This increase was the result of the Esselte and Pelikan Artline acquisitions, which further extended our geographic reach.\nOver the past several years we have transformed our business by: divesting certain non-core commercially-oriented product lines; acquiring companies with consumer and end-user demanded brands, and continuing to diversify our distribution channels. In 2012, we acquired the Mead Consumer and Office Products business (\"Mead C&OP\"), which substantially increased our presence in North America and Brazil in school and calendar products with well-known consumer brands. In 2016, we purchased the remaining equity interest in Pelikan Artline from our joint venture partner, which enhanced our competitive position in school and business products in Australia and New Zealand and added new consumer categories, including writing instruments and janitorial supplies. In early 2017, we acquired Esselte Group Holdings AB (\"Esselte\"), which more than doubled our presence in Europe and added several iconic business brands, a significant base of independent dealer customers, and a new product category of do-it-yourself hardware tools. Together these three acquisitions have meaningfully expanded our portfolio of well-known end-user demanded brands, enhanced our competitive position from both a product and channel perspective, and added scale to our business operations.\nToday our Company is a global enterprise focused on developing innovative branded consumer products for use in businesses, schools and homes. We believe our leading product category positions provide the scale to enable us to invest in marketing and product innovation to drive profitable growth. We expect to derive much of our growth, over the long term, in faster-growing emerging geographies such as Latin America and parts of Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe, which exhibit stronger demand for our product categories than in developed markets. In all of our markets we see opportunities to grow sales through share gains, channel expansion and innovative products. We plan to supplement organic growth globally with strategic acquisitions in both existing and adjacent product categories.\nAcquisitions\nEsselte Group Holdings AB Acquisition and Refinancing\nOn January 31, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition (the \"Esselte Acquisition\") of Esselte. Accordingly, the results of Esselte are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from February 1, 2017 forward and are reported in all three of the Company's segments, but primarily in the ACCO Brands EMEA segment. The acquisition of Esselte made ACCO Brands a leading European manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer and office products, and improved ACCO Brands' scale. Esselte products are primarily marketed under the Leitz\u00ae, Rapid\u00ae and Esselte\u00ae brands in the storage and organization, stapling, punching, binding and laminating equipment and do-it-yourself tools product categories.\nThe cash purchase price paid was $292.3 million, net of cash acquired of $34.2 million. In connection with the Esselte Acquisition, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"2017 Credit Agreement\"), dated as of January 27, 2017. The 2017 Credit Agreement provides for a five-year senior secured credit facility, which consists of a \u20ac300.0 million (US$320.8 million based on January 27, 2017 exchange rates) term loan facility (the \"Euro Term Loan A\"), a A$80.0 million (US$60.4 million based on January 27, 2017 exchange rates) term loan facility (the \"AUD Term Loan A\"), and a\nUS$400.0 million multi-currency revolving credit facility (the \"2017 Revolving Facility\").\nPelikan Artline Joint-Venture Acquisition\nOn May 2, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Australia Stationery Industries, Inc. (the \"PA Acquisition\"), which indirectly owned the 50% of the Pelikan Artline joint-venture and the issued capital stock of Pelikan Artline Pty Limited (collectively, \"Pelikan Artline\") that was not already owned by the Company. Prior to the PA Acquisition, the Pelikan Artline joint-venture was accounted for using the equity method. The results of Pelikan Artline are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from May 2, 2016 forward, and are reported in the ACCO Brands International segment. Accordingly, we no longer separately report equity in earnings from this joint-venture. Pelikan Artline is a premier distributor of recognized consumer brands used in businesses, schools, and homes in Australia and New Zealand.\nFor further information on the acquisitions, see \"Note 3. Acquisitions\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report. For information on the financings of the acquisitions, see \"Note 4. Long-term Debt and Short-term Borrowings\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nReportable Segments\nEffective in the first quarter of 2017, as a result of the Esselte Acquisition, the Company realigned its operating structure, which affected the makeup of its business segments for financial reporting purposes. The Company has three operating business segments each of which is comprised of different geographic regions. The Company no longer reports the results of its Computer Products Group as a separate segment. Results of the former Computer Products Group are reflected in the appropriate geographic segment based on the region from which sales are made. The Company's three realigned business segments are as follows:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Geographic Regions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primary Brands\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ACCO Brands North America\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>United States and Canada\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AT-A-GLANCE\u00ae, Five Star\u00ae, GBC\u00ae, Hilroy\u00ae, Kensington\u00ae, Mead\u00ae, Quartet\u00ae, and Swingline\u00ae\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ACCO Brands EMEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Europe, Middle East and Africa\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Derwent\u00ae, Esselte\u00ae, GBC\u00ae, Kensington\u00ae, Leitz\u00ae, NOBO\u00ae, Rapid\u00ae, and Rexel\u00ae\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ACCO Brands International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Australia, Latin America and Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Artline\u00ae, GBC\u00ae, Kensington\u00ae, Marbig\u00ae, Quartet\u00ae, Rexel\u00ae, Tilibra\u00ae, and Wilson Jones\u00ae\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have restated our financial statements for each of the periods presented to reflect this change in reportable business segments.\nEach of the Company's three operating segments designs, markets, sources, manufactures and sells recognized consumer and end-user demanded brands used in businesses, schools and homes. Product designs are tailored based on end-user preferences in each geographic region.\nOur product categories include storage and organization; stapling; punching; laminating, binding and shredding machines and related consumable supplies; whiteboards; notebooks; calendars; computer accessories; and do-it-yourself tools, among others. Our portfolio of consumer and end-user demanded brands includes both globally and regionally recognized brands.\nACCO Brands markets and sells its strong multi-product offering broadly and is not dependent on any one channel. Our products are sold through all relevant channels, namely retailers, including: mass retailers; e-tailers; discount, drug/grocery and variety chains; warehouse clubs; hardware and specialty stores; independent office product dealers; office superstores; and contract stationers. We also sell directly to commercial and consumer end-users through our e-commerce platform and our direct sales organization.\nFor further information on our business segments see \"Note 16. Information on Business Segments\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report.\nOverview of 2017 Performance\nOur financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflect the significant benefit of our acquisitions. The Esselte Acquisition and the PA Acquisition primarily impact the financial results of our EMEA and International segments, respectively. For more information, see \"Note 3. Acquisitions\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nThe Company's cash flow from operations, effective tax rate and interest payments were impacted by the refinancing of our senior unsecured notes in December 2016 to obtain a lower interest rate, and the increase in our bank debt in January 2017 to finance the Esselte Acquisition. For further information, see \"Note 4. Long-term Debt and Short-term Borrowings\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nIn addition, we recorded a tax benefit of $25.7 million related to the newly passed U.S Tax Act in December of 2017. For further information, see \"Note 11. Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nForeign currency translation also impacted our consolidated financial statements favorably for the year ended December 31, 2017. Where necessary, we adjust sales prices to cover the impacts of currency fluctuation on our cost of goods sold and take currency positions to allow for the time needed to generally achieve the sales price adjustments.\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions of dollars, except per share data)\n</td> <td>2017(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%/pts\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,948.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,557.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>391.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>1,292.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,042.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>656.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>515.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin\n</td> <td>33.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>406.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>320.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>35.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>21.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>193.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income margin\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>41.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>(5.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings of joint venture\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>26.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>131.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding:\n</td> <td>110.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted income per share\n</td> <td>1.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The Company acquired Esselte on January 31, 2017; Esselte's results are included in 2017 results from February 1, 2017 forward. \n (2) The Company acquired Pelikan Artline on May 2, 2016; Pelikan Artline's results are included in 2016 results from that date forward. \nNet Sales\nNet sales of $1,948.8 million, including $438.8 million attributable to the Esselte and PA Acquisitions, were up $391.7 million, or 25%, from $1,557.1 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased sales by $12.4 million, or 1% in the current-year period. Comparable net sales, excluding the acquisitions and foreign currency translation, were down primarily due to declines at certain office superstore customers and lost product placements.\nCost of Products Sold\nCost of products sold includes all manufacturing, product sourcing and distribution costs, including depreciation related to assets used in the manufacturing, procurement and distribution processes, allocation of certain information technology costs supporting those processes, inbound and outbound freight, shipping and handling costs, purchasing costs associated with materials and packaging used in the production processes and inventory valuation adjustments. Cost of products sold of $1,292.4 million, was up $250.4 million, or 24%, from $1,042.0 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced cost of\nproducts sold by $8.4 million, or 1% in the current-year period. Underlying cost of products sold, excluding foreign currency translation, increased due to the inclusion of the acquisitions, partially offset by lower comparable sales and cost savings and productivity improvements.\nGross Profit\nWe believe that gross profit and gross profit margin provide enhanced shareholder appreciation of underlying profit drivers. Gross profit of $656.4 million, was up $141.3 million, or 27%, from $515.1 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased gross profit by $4.0 million, or 1% in the current-year period. Underlying gross profit, excluding foreign currency translation, increased due to the inclusion of the acquisitions, together with productivity initiatives and higher pricing, which was partially offset by lower comparable sales and inflation.\nGross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 33.7% from 33.1%. The increase was primarily due to productivity improvements and higher pricing.\nSelling, General and Administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") include advertising, marketing, selling (including commissions), research and development, customer service, depreciation related to assets outside the manufacturing and distribution processes, and all other general and administrative expenses outside the manufacturing and distribution functions (e.g., finance, human resources, information technology and corporate expenses). SG&A of $406.1 million, was up $85.3 million, or 27%, from $320.8 million in the prior-year period. The current-year period includes $16.4 million of integration and transaction costs related to the acquisitions. The prior-year period included $12.8 million in transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions. Foreign currency translation increased SG&A by $0.6 million, or 0.2%, in the current-year period. Underlying SG&A, excluding integration and transaction costs and foreign currency translation, increased primarily due to the inclusion of the acquisitions.\nAs a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased to 20.8% from 20.6% in the prior-year period, primarily due to higher integration and transaction costs incurred in the current-year period, partially offset by productivity initiatives.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nAmortization of intangibles of $35.6 million, was up $14.0 million, or 65%, from $21.6 million in the prior-year period. The increase was due to the inclusion of the Esselte and PA Acquisitions.\nRestructuring Charges\nRestructuring charges in the current-year period of $21.7 million related primarily to the integrations of Esselte and Pelikan Artline. Restructuring charges in the prior-year period of $5.4 million related primarily to the integration of Pelikan Artline and consolidation of certain functions in the North America segment.\nOperating Income\nOperating income of $193.0 million, was up $25.7 million, or 15%, from $167.3 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $3.2 million, or 2%, in the current-year period. Underlying operating income, excluding restructuring, transaction and integration costs, and foreign currency translation, increased primarily due to the inclusion of the acquisitions.\nInterest Expense, Equity in Earnings of Joint Venture and Other (Income) Expense, Net\nInterest expense of $41.1 million, was down $8.2 million, or 17%, from $49.3 million in the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to the lower interest rate paid on our senior unsecured notes, which were refinanced in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by interest resulting from increased debt incurred in connection with the Esselte Acquisition. The prior-year period included $2.5 million of incremental interest expense related to the above-referenced refinancing of our senior unsecured notes and the accelerated amortization of debt issuance cost related to the prepayment of $70 million on our U.S. Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A.\nAs a result of the PA Acquisition, which was completed on May 2, 2016, equity in earnings of joint venture decreased $2.1 million as the Company ceased accounting for the Pelikan Artline joint-venture using the equity method of accounting.\nOther (income) expense, net was income of $0.4 million compared to expense of $1.4 million in the prior-year period. The current-year period included a $2.3 million foreign currency gain related to the settlement of certain intercompany loan transactions. The prior-year period included charges associated with the refinancing of our senior unsecured notes. These charges consisted of $25.0 million in a \"make-whole\" call premium and a $4.9 million charge for the write-off of debt issuance costs, which were offset by a $28.9 million non-cash gain arising from the PA Acquisition due to the revaluation of the Company's previously held equity interest to fair value and a gain on the settlement of an intercompany loan of $1.0 million, previously deemed permanently invested.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the current-year period, income tax expense was $26.4 million on income before taxes of $158.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 16.7%. The low effective tax rate for the current-year period is primarily due to a net tax benefit of $25.7 million related to the newly passed U.S. Tax Act in December of 2017. This benefit was driven by the reduction of net deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings (the \"Transition Toll Tax\"). For further information on the impact of the U.S. Tax Act, see \"Note 11. Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report. Also contributing to the low effective rate was $5.6 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation related to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. See \"Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report for details on the adoption of this new standard.\nFor the prior-year period, income tax expense was $29.6 million on income before taxes of $125.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 23.7%. The low effective tax rate in the prior-year period was primarily due to the following: 1) the $28.9 million gain arising from the PA Acquisition due to the revaluation of the previously held equity interest to fair value, which was not subject to tax, and 2) tax losses on foreign exchange on the repayment of intercompany loans, for which the pre-tax effect was recorded in equity.\nNet Income\nNet income of $131.7 million, was up $36.2 million, or 38%, from $95.5 million in the prior-year period. Diluted income per share was $1.19, up $0.32, or 37% from $0.87 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased net income by $5.9 million, or 6% in the current-year period. The increase in net income was primarily due to inclusion of the acquisitions, lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate.\nSegment Net Sales and Operating Income for the Years Ended

\"Note 16. Information on Business Segments\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report for a reconciliation of total \"Segment operating income\" to \"Income before income tax.\" \nACCO Brands North America\nACCO Brands North America net sales of $999.0 million, including $13.4 million attributable to the Esselte Acquisition, were down $17.1 million, or 2%, from $1,016.1 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased sales by $2.0 million, or 0.2%, in the current-year period. Comparable net sales, excluding Esselte and foreign currency translation, decreased primarily due to continued declines with office superstore customers and lost product placements with certain customers. Sales during the back-to-school season were down slightly compared to the prior year, which had strong growth.\nACCO Brands North America operating income of $155.6 million, was up $2.3 million, or 2%, from $153.3 million in the prior-year period, and operating income as a percent of net sales increased to 15.6% from 15.1%. The increase was due to higher gross margins from cost savings and productivity initiatives, and reduced customer sales rebates, which were partially offset by lower comparable sales, higher go-to-market spending and $5.5 million in restructuring charges (versus $1.1 million in the prior-year period). The restructuring charges related to the realignment of the operating structure of our former Computer Products Group, the Esselte integration and other projects to enhance the future long-term performance of the business.\nACCO Brands EMEA\nACCO Brands EMEA net sales of $542.8 million, including approximately $388 million attributable to the Esselte Acquisition, were up $371.0 million, or 216%, from $171.8 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased sales by $0.8 million, or 0.5%, in the current-year period. Comparable net sales, excluding Esselte and foreign currency translation, decreased due to lost product placements and inventory reductions by certain customers.\nACCO Brands EMEA operating income of $37.1 million, including approximately $24.9 million attributable to the Esselte Acquisition, was up $24.5 million, or 194%, from $12.6 million in the prior-year period, but operating income as a percent of net sales decreased to 6.8% from 7.3%. The increase in operating income was driven by the Esselte Acquisition and includes restructuring costs of $11.2 million, integration costs of $5.5 million, and the amortization of step-up in the value of finished goods inventory of $0.8 million. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $2.4 million in the current-year period. Underlying operating income, excluding Esselte, restructuring and integration costs, foreign currency translation and the amortization of step-up in the value of finished goods inventory, decreased due to lower comparable sales, partially offset by reduced SG&A expenses.\nOperating income as a percent of sales decreased due to restructuring and integration costs, higher intangible amortization resulting from the Esselte Acquisition and lower gross margins (primarily due to Esselte having lower margins than the legacy ACCO business), partially offset by the lower SG&A margins in the legacy Esselte business.\nACCO Brands International\nACCO Brands International net sales of $407.0 million, including $37.9 million attributable to the PA and Esselte Acquisitions, were up $37.8 million, or 10%, from $369.2 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased sales by $9.6 million, or 3% in the current-year period. Comparable net sales, excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translation, decreased primarily due to lost product placements and inventory reductions in Australia, partially offset by higher sales in Brazil and Mexico.\nACCO Brands International operating income of $50.9 million, was up $1.5 million, or 3%, from $49.4 million in the prior-year period, but operating income as a percent of net sales decreased to 12.5% from 13.4%. Restructuring and integration costs in the current-year period were $5.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively. In addition, the current-year period includes a $1.5 million gain on the sale of a distribution center in New Zealand related to the integration of Pelikan Artline. The prior-year period includes restructuring costs of $4.3 million, integration costs of $2.3 million and the amortization of the step-up in value of the finished goods inventory of $0.4 million. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $0.7 million in the current-year period. Underlying operating income, excluding restructuring and integration costs, the amortization of step-up in the value of finished goods inventory, the gain on sale of the distribution center and foreign currency translation, was flat due to the inclusion of the results of Pelikan Artline in the current-year period and improved profitability in Brazil and Mexico, which was offset by lower comparable net sales and higher distribution costs associated with the warehouse and IT system consolidation in Australia.\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions of dollars, except per share data)\n</td> <td>2016(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%/pts\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,557.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,510.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>1,042.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,032.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>515.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>478.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin\n</td> <td>33.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>320.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>21.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges (credits)\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>167.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income margin\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>49.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>(6.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings of joint venture\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>29.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>23.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>95.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding:\n</td> <td>109.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted income per share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The Company acquired Pelikan Artline on May 2, 2016; the results of which are included in 2016 results from that date forward. \nNet Sales\nNet sales of $1,557.1 million, including $78.5 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, were up $46.7 million, or 3%, from $1,510.4 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced net sales by $16.9 million, or 1%. Comparable net sales, excluding Pelikan Artline and foreign currency translation, were down due to declines at certain wholesalers and office superstores customers, partially offset by strong growth at mass and e-tail customers.\nCost of Products Sold\nCost of products sold of $1,042.0 million, including $47.7 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, was up $10.0 million, or 1%, from $1,032.0 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation decreased cost of products sold by $13.3 million, or 1%. Underlying cost of products sold, excluding Pelikan Artline and foreign currency translation, decreased due to lower sales volume and productivity improvements, partially offset by foreign-exchange-related inflationary increases in certain foreign markets' cost of products sold.\nGross Profit\nGross profit of $515.1 million, including $30.8 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, was up $36.7 million, or 8%, from $478.4 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation decreased gross profit by $3.6 million, or 1%. Underlying gross profit, excluding Pelikan Artline and foreign currency translation, increased due to higher pricing and productivity improvements, which were partially offset by foreign-exchange-related inflationary increases in certain foreign markets' costs of products sold.\nGross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 33.1% from 31.7% in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to cost savings and productivity improvements, higher pricing and the positive impact of the PA Acquisition.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A of $320.8 million, including $16.6 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, was up $25.1 million, or 8%, from $295.7 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced SG&A by $4.8 million, or 2%. The prior-year period included $3.6 million of integration and transaction costs related to the PA Acquisition. Underlying SG&A, excluding Pelikan Artline and foreign currency translation, increased, driven by higher professional fees, including $9.2 million of transaction costs related to the Esselte Acquisition. Additionally, the prior-year period benefited from a one-time $2.3 million recovery of an indirect tax in Brazil.\nAs a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased to 20.6% from 19.6% in the prior-year period for the reasons mentioned above.\nRestructuring Charges (Credits)\nWe initiated cost reduction plans related to the consolidation and integration of Pelikan Artline with our already existing Australian and New Zealand businesses and, as a result, incurred $4.2 million of charges in 2016, primarily related to severance. In addition, in 2016 we initiated additional cost reduction plans and incurred $1.2 million of severance charges related to the consolidation of certain functions in the North America segment.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nAmortization of intangibles was $21.6 million, up $2.0 million, or 10%, from $19.6 million in the prior-year period. The increase was due to the inclusion due to the PA Acquisition.\nOperating Income\nOperating income of $167.3 million, including $5.6 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, was up $3.8 million, or 2%, from $163.5 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $1.6 million, or 1%. Underlying operating income, excluding the PA Acquisition and foreign currency translation, decreased primarily due to increased SG&A.\nInterest Expense and Other Expense, Net\nInterest expense of $49.3 million, was up $4.8 million, or 11%, from $44.5 million in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to additional debt incurred to finance the PA Acquisition and the refinancing of our senior unsecured notes which resulted in the payment of $2.5 million of incremental interest expense. Also contributing to the increase was the accelerated amortization of debt issuance cost related to the prepayment of $70 million on our U.S. Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A.\nOther expense, net of $1.4 million was down $0.7 million from $2.1 million in the prior-year period. The 2016 year included charges associated with the above referenced refinancing of our senior unsecured notes. These charges consisted of $25.0 million in a \"make-whole\" call premium and a $4.9 million charge for the write-off of debt issuance costs, which were offset by a $28.9 million non-cash gain arising from the PA Acquisition due to the revaluation of the Company's previously held equity interest to fair value and a gain on the settlement of an intercompany loan of $1.0 million, previously deemed permanently invested. In the prior-year period we wrote-off $1.9 million of debt issuance costs related to the refinancing completed in 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $29.6 million on income before taxes of $125.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 23.7%. For the prior-year period, income tax expense was $45.5 million on income before taxes of $131.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 34.6%. The low effective tax rate in 2016 was primarily due to the following: 1) the $28.9 million non-cash gain arising from the PA Acquisition due to the revaluation of the previously held equity interest to fair value, which was not subject to tax, and 2) tax losses on foreign exchange on the repayment of intercompany loans, for which the pre-tax effect was recorded in equity.\nNet Income\nNet income was $95.5 million, up $9.6 million, or 11%, from $85.9 million in the prior-year period. Diluted income per share was $0.87, up $0.09, or 12% from $0.78 per diluted share in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to the lower effective tax rate in 2016.\nSegment Net Sales and Operating Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment Operating Income(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating Income Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment Operating Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment Operating Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Margin Points\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ACCO Brands North America\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,016.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ACCO Brands EMEA\n</td> <td>171.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(170\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ACCO Brands International\n</td> <td>369.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>320\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,557.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment Operating Income(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating Income Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ACCO Brands North America\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,025.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ACCO Brands EMEA\n</td> <td>199.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ACCO Brands International\n</td> <td>285.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,510.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Segment operating income excludes corporate costs: \"Interest expense;\" \"Interest income;\" \"Equity in earnings of joint-venture\" and \"Other (income) expense, net.\" See \"Note 16. Information on Business Segments\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report for a reconciliation of total \"Segment operating income\" to \"Income before income tax.\" \nACCO Brands North America\nACCO Brands North America net sales of $1,016.1 million, were down $9.6 million, or 1%, from $1,025.7 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by $4.1 million, or 0.4%. Comparable net sales, excluding foreign currency translation, decreased due to declines at certain wholesalers and an office products superstore due to inventory reductions and consumers purchasing in different channels. The net sales decline was partially offset by strong back-to-school sales, notably with mass-market customers and e-tailers, due to increased product placements and broadened product offerings.\nACCO Brands North America operating income of $153.3 million, was up $1.7 million, or 1%, from $151.6 million in the prior-year period. Operating income as a percent of net sales increased to 15.1% from 14.8% in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation decreased operating income by $0.4 million, or 0.2%. Underlying operating income, excluding foreign currency translation, increased due to productivity improvements.\nACCO Brands EMEA\nACCO Brands EMEA net sales of $171.8 million, were down $27.9 million, or 14%, from $199.7 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by $8.6 million, or 4%. Comparable net sales, excluding foreign currency translation, decreased due to lower volume as a result of the ongoing inventory reductions, as well as lost share with some customers and lower consumer demand, partially offset by price increases that were implemented to recover gross margins following foreign-exchange-related cost of products sold increases.\nACCO Brands EMEA operating income of $12.6 million, was down $5.4 million, or 30% from $18.0 million in the prior-year period. Operating income as a percent of net sales decreased to 7.3% from 9.0% in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $0.3 million. Underlying operating income, excluding foreign currency translation, decreased primarily due to lower comparable net sales, partially offset by higher gross margins.\nACCO Brands International\nACCO Brands International net sales of $369.2 million, including $78.5 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, were up $84.2 million, or 30%, from $285.0 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by $4.2 million,\nor 1%. Comparable net sales, excluding Pelikan Artline and foreign currency translation, increased due to higher pricing, which benefited sales by 9%. Price increases were implemented to recover gross margins following foreign-exchange-related cost of products sold increases, in Australia and Mexico, as well as to offset paper related inflation in Brazil. Partially offsetting the price increases were volume declines, primarily in the legacy ACCO Brands Australian business.\nACCO Brands International operating income of $49.4 million, including $6.9 million attributable to the PA Acquisition, increased $20.3 million, or 70%, from $29.1 million in the prior-year period, and operating income as a percent of net sales increased to 13.4% from 10.2% in the prior-year period. Pelikan Artline operating income of $6.9 million includes restructuring costs of $4.2 million and integration costs of $2.3 million. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $1.7 million, or 6%, due to the recovery of the Brazilian real, which occurred in the seasonally stronger fourth quarter. Underlying operating income, excluding Pelikan Artline and foreign currency translation, increased due to higher pricing and productivity improvements, partially offset by lower volumes. In addition, the prior-year period included a one-time $2.3 million recovery of an indirect tax and $1.3 million of severance charges, both in Brazil.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary liquidity needs are to service indebtedness, fund capital expenditures and support working capital requirements. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents held and seasonal borrowings under our 2017 Revolving Facility. As of December 31, 2017, there was $133.9 million in borrowings outstanding under our $400.0 million 2017 Revolving Facility and the amount available for borrowings was $255.0 million (allowing for $11.1 million of letters of credit outstanding on that date).\nWe maintain adequate financing arrangements at market rates. Because of the seasonality of our business, we typically generate much of our cash flow in the first, third and fourth quarters, as accounts receivables are collected, and we use cash in the second quarter to fund working capital in order to support the North America back-to-school season. Our Brazilian business is highly seasonal due to the timing of the back-to-school season, which coincides with the calendar year-end in the fourth quarter. Due to various tax laws, it is costly to transfer short-term working capital in and out of Brazil; therefore, our normal practice is to hold seasonal cash requirements in Brazil, and invest in short-term Brazilian government securities. Consolidated cash and cash equivalents was $76.9 million as of December 31, 2017, approximately $31 million of which was held in Brazil.\nOn February 12, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved the initiation of a cash dividend program under which the Company will pay a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share on its common stock ($0.24 per share on an annualized basis). In addition, on February 14, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved an authorization to repurchase up to an additional $100 million in shares of its common stock. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $84.0 million remaining of its prior authorizations.\nOur priorities for cash flow use over the near term, after funding business operations, including restructuring expenditures, are debt reduction, dividends, stock repurchases and to fund strategic acquisitions.\nThe current senior secured credit facilities had a weighted average interest rate of 3.48% as of December 31, 2017 and our senior unsecured notes have a fixed interest rate of 5.25%.\nDebt Amendments and Refinancing\nThird Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\nIn connection with the Esselte Acquisition, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"2017 Credit Agreement\"), dated as of January 27, 2017, among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other agents and various lenders party thereto. The 2017 Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company's Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated April 28, 2015 (the \"2015 Credit Agreement\").\nThe 2017 Credit Agreement provides a five-year senior secured credit facility, which consists of a \u20ac300 million (US$320.8 million based on January 27, 2017 exchange rates) term loan facility (the \"Euro Term Loan A\"), a A$80 million (US$60.4 million based on January 27, 2017 exchange rates) term loan facility (the \"AUD Term Loan A\" and, together with the Euro Term Loan A, the \"2017 Term A Loan Facility\"), and a US$400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility (the \"2017 Revolving Facility\").\nMaturity and Amortization\nBorrowings under the 2017 Revolving Facility and the 2017 Term A Loan Facility mature on January 27, 2022. Amounts under the 2017 Revolving Facility are non-amortizing. Beginning June 30, 2017, the outstanding principal amounts under the 2017 Term A Loan Facility are payable in quarterly installments in an amount representing, on an annual basis, 5.0% of the initial aggregate principal amount of such loan facility and increasing to 12.5% on an annual basis by June 30, 2020.\nInterest rates\nAmounts outstanding under the 2017 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Euro Rate with a 0% floor, the Australian BBSR Rate, the Canadian BA Rate or the Base Rate, as applicable and as each such rate is defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement, plus an \"applicable rate.\" The applicable rate applied to outstanding Euro, Australian and Canadian dollar denominated loans and Base Rate loans is based on the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement) as follows:\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated\nLeverage Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Applicable Rate on Euro/AUD/CDN Dollar Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Applicable Rate on Base Rate Loans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>> 4.00 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.50%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2264 4.00 to 1.00 and > 3.50 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.25%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2264 3.50 to 1.00 and > 3.00 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2264 3.00 to 1.00 and > 2.00 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.50%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2264 2.00 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, the applicable rate on Euro, Australian and Canadian dollar loans was 1.50% and the applicable rate on Base Rate loans was 0.50%.

As of December 31, 2017, the commitment fee rate was 0.30%.\nPrepayments\nSubject to certain conditions and specific exceptions, the 2017 Credit Agreement requires the Company to prepay outstanding amounts under the 2017 Credit Agreement under various circumstances, including (a) if sales or dispositions of certain property or assets in any fiscal year results in the receipt of net cash proceeds of $12.0 million, then an amount equal to 100% of the net cash proceeds received in excess of such $12.0 million, and (b) with respect to the AUD Term Loan A, in an amount equal to 100% of the net cash proceeds received from the disposition of any real property located in Australia. The Company also would be required to make prepayments in the event it receives proceeds related to certain property insurance or condemnation awards, from additional debt other than debt permitted under the 2017 Credit Agreement and from excess cash flow as determined under the 2017 Credit Agreement. The 2017 Credit Agreement also contains other customary prepayment obligations and provides for voluntary commitment reductions and prepayment of loans, subject to certain conditions and exceptions.\nDividends and Share Repurchases\nUnder the 2017 Credit Agreement, the Company may pay dividends and/or repurchase shares in an aggregate amount not to exceed the sum of: (i) the greater of $30 million and 1.00% of the Company's Consolidated Total Assets (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement); plus (ii) an additional amount not to exceed $75.0 million in any fiscal year (provided the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio after giving pro forma effect to the restricted payment would be greater than 2.50:1.00 and less than or equal to 3.75:1.00); plus (iii) an additional amount so long as the Consolidated Leverage Ratio after giving pro forma effect to the restricted payment would be less than or equal to 2.50:1.00; plus (iv) any Net Equity Proceeds (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement).\nFinancial Covenants\nThe Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter may not exceed 3.75:1.00; provided that following the consummation of a Material Acquisition (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement), and as of the end of the fiscal quarter in which such Material Acquisition occurred and as of the end of the three fiscal quarters thereafter, the maximum\nConsolidated Leverage Ratio level above will increase by 0.50:1.00, provided that no more than one such increase can be in effect at any time. The Esselte Acquisition qualified as a Material Acquisition under the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nThe 2017 Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement) as of the end of any fiscal quarter at or above 1.25 to 1.00.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 2.6 to 1 and our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio was approximately 5.3 to 1.\nOther Covenants and Restrictions\nThe 2017 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults, certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, certain ERISA-related events, changes in control or ownership and invalidity of any loan document. The 2017 Credit Agreement also establishes limitations on the aggregate amount of Permitted Acquisitions and Investments (each as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement) that the Company and its subsidiaries may make during the term of the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nAs of and for the periods ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all applicable loan covenants.\nGuarantees and Security\nGenerally, obligations under the 2017 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Company's existing and future subsidiaries, and are secured by substantially all of the Company's and certain guarantor subsidiaries' assets, subject to certain exclusions and limitations.\nIncremental Facilities\nThe 2017 Credit Agreement permits the Company to seek increases in the size of the 2017 Revolving Facility and the 2017 Term A Loan Facility prior to maturity by up to $500.0 million in the aggregate, subject to lender commitment and the conditions set forth in the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nSenior Unsecured Notes due December 2024\nOn December 22, 2016, the Company completed a private offering of $400.0 million in senior unsecured notes, due December 2024 (the \"New Notes\"), which bear interest at 5.25%. Net proceeds from the sale of the New Notes, together with borrowings of $73.9 million under the Company's revolving credit facility and cash on hand, were used to redeem the then existing senior unsecured notes (the \"Old Notes\"). The aggregate redemption price of $531.5 million consisted of principal due and payable on the Old Notes, a \"make-whole\" call premium of $25.0 million (included in \"Other (income) expense, net\"), and accrued and unpaid interest of $6.5 million (included in \"Interest expense\") which the Company irrevocably deposited with the trustee of the Old Notes thereby satisfying all its obligations related to the Old Notes.\nAlso included in \"Other expense, net\" is a $4.9 million charge for the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the Old Notes. Additionally, we incurred and capitalized approximately $6.1 million in bank, legal and other fees associated with the issuance of the New Notes.\nRestructuring and Integration Activities\nFrom time to time the Company may implement restructuring, realignment or cost-reduction plans and activities, including those related to integrating acquired businesses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an aggregate $21.7 million in restructuring expenses primarily related to the integration of the ACCO Brands and Esselte operations worldwide. The remaining charges relate to the integration of ACCO Brands and Pelikan Artline operations in Australia and New Zealand, and the change in the operating structure in North America, including integration of our former Computer Products Group into our remaining business segments. As of December 31, 2017, there was $13.3 million remaining of restructuring liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. For further information, see \"Note 10. Restructuring\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an aggregate $11.4 million in non-restructuring integration expenses related to the integration of the ACCO Brands and Esselte and Pelikan Artline operations.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company approved additional restructuring projects aggregating to $3.5 million, primarily related to changes to the structure in the ACCO Brands North America segment and the continued integration of Esselte in the ACCO Brands EMEA segment. In accordance with GAAP, none of the aforementioned liabilities were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nConsistent with our previous communications about the Esselte Acquisition, the Company currently expects it will record approximately $4 million for integration activities and $4 million of incremental restructuring expenses during the remainder of 2018, which is in addition to the $3.5 million of restructuring projects approved during the first quarter of 2018. As integration plans are still being finalized, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the nature or timing of these restructuring and integration charges or the timing of their associated cash outflows.\nCash Flow for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 of $204.9 million was generated principally from increased operating profits, primarily due to the Esselte and PA Acquisitions. Cash generated by incremental operating profits was partially offset by lower contribution from working capital (accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable), payments of professional fees associated with acquisition and integration activities for the Esselte and PA Acquisitions, increased cash taxes and higher pension contributions. For the 2016 year, cash provided by operating activities was $167.1 million. Net income for 2017 was $131.7 million compared to $95.5 million in 2016.\nThe table below shows our cash flow from accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow (used) provided by net working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounts receivable contributed $10.2 million, which was lower than the prior year of $13.4 million due to the timing of the Esselte Acquisition and higher sales in certain foreign markets. Inventory contributed $2.5 million, which was lower than the prior year of $16.7 million due to the Esselte and PA Acquisitions, inventory reductions at certain customers and inventory builds in support of warehouse integration activities. Partially offsetting the cash generated from net working capital were employee annual incentive payments made in the first quarter (including payroll taxes) related to transaction bonuses paid by the seller in connection with the Esselte Acquisition. The settlement of customer program liabilities was lower, primarily driven by lower sales in comparable businesses, partially offset by increased settlements from the Esselte Acquisition. Other significant cash fluctuations included income tax payments of $34.8 million in 2017, which were higher than the $16.9 million paid in 2016 due to higher international taxes, largely related to the Esselte Acquisition, and pension contributions of $21.7 million in 2017, which increased from $6.2 million in 2016 due to higher U.S. contribution requirements and the Esselte Acquisition. Restructuring payments of $13.4 million (primarily associated with headcount reductions and footprint rationalization activities in connection with the integration of Esselte and Pelikan Artline) were higher than the prior-year spend of $4.9 million. Interest payments were $38.0 million, lower than the prior-year payments of $50.1 million due to refinancing activities in late 2016 and lower debt.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nCash used by investing activities was $319.1 million and $106.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The 2017 cash outflow reflects the $292.3 million purchase price, net of cash acquired, paid for Esselte. The 2016 cash outflow reflects the $88.8 million purchase price, net of cash acquired, paid for Pelikan Artline. For further information, see \"Note 3. Acquisitions\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report. Capital expenditures were $31.0 million and $18.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with the increase driven by information technology systems-related investments.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $142.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $76.4 million used for the same period of 2016. Cash provided in 2017 reflects long-term borrowings of $484.1 million, consisting of \u20ac300.0 million (US$320.8 million based on January 27, 2017 exchange rates) in the form of the Euro Term Loan A incurred to fund the Esselte Acquisition, along with additional borrowings of US$91.4 million under the Company's 2017 Revolving Facility, primarily to repay the then existing U.S. Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A in the amount of $81.0 million and to reduce the outstanding balance on the Australian Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A. Additionally, we used $41.8 million for repurchases of our common stock and payments related to tax withholding for stock-based compensation, net of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, and $3.6 million of debt issuance costs associated with the financing of the Esselte Acquisition.\nCash used in 2016 of $76.4 million reflected long-term borrowings of $587.4 million, consisting primarily of a private issuance of New Notes of $400.0 million and an incremental loan in the amount of A$100.0 million (US$76.6 million based on May 2, 2016 exchange rates), along with additional borrowings under the Company's then existing revolving facility, to fund the PA Acquisition. Repayments of long-term debt of $685.1 million primarily reflects the early satisfaction and discharge of our $500 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes, repayments totaling $148.0 million on the then existing U.S. Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A and payment of $24.5 million of debt assumed with the PA Acquisition. In 2016, we also made a \"make-whole\" call premium payment of $25.0 million related to the early satisfaction and discharge of our $500.0 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes, and paid $6.9 million in debt issuance fees in connection with the New Notes.\nCash Flow for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $167.1 million compared to cash provided by the prior-year operating activities of $171.2 million. Net income for 2016 was $95.5 million compared to $85.9 million in 2015. The net operating cash inflow for the 2016 year of $167.1 million was generated by enhanced profitability, improved net working capital management (accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable) and incremental cash flow from the PA Acquisition. Cash outflows in 2016 included an accelerated interest payment of $6.5 million, in association with the early satisfaction and discharge of our senior unsecured notes. Additionally, $11.6 million of cash payments were for transaction and integration costs associated with the Esselte and PA Acquisitions.\nThe table below shows our cash flow from accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively:\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by net working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounts receivable contributed $13.4 million in 2016 due to improved management of year-end collections. Inventory provided cash of $16.7 million as a result of increased real-time inventory purchases earlier in the fourth quarter and improved forecasting, which also contributed to an increased use of cash for accounts payable, which was $19.3 million in 2016, compared to $2.6 million in the prior year. Partially offsetting the cash generated from operating profit and net working capital were significant cash payments related to the settlement of customer program liabilities, which were higher than the prior year due to changes in 2016 customer mix and increased settlements in early 2016 (related to higher year-end 2015 purchases by certain customers to achieve rebate levels). Outflows related to employee annual incentive payments made in the first quarter, underlying interest payments, income tax payments and restructuring cash payments were similar to those made during the prior year.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nCash used by investing activities was $106.4 million and $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 2016 cash outflow reflects the $88.8 million purchase price, net of cash acquired, paid for Pelikan Artline. For further information on the PA Acquisition, see \"Note 3. Acquisition\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report. Capital expenditures were $18.5 million and $27.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The lower capital expenditures in 2016 reflects lower spending on information technology due to the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system in our European operations in the first quarter of 2016.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nCash used by financing activities was $76.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a use of $137.8 million for the same period of 2015. Cash used in 2016 reflected long-term borrowings of $587.4 million, consisting"}
