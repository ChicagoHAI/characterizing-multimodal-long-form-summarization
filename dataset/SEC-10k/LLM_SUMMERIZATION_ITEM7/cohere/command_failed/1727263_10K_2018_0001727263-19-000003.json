MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\ufeff\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and the audited consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. The cautionary statements discussed in Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read as applying to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nOverview\n\ufeff\nFrontdoor is the largest provider of home service plans in the United States, as measured by revenue, and operates under the American Home Shield, HSA, OneGuard and Landmark brands. Our home service plans help our customers maintain their homes and protect against costly and unexpected breakdowns of essential home systems and appliances. Our home service plan customers subscribe to a yearly service plan agreement that covers the repair or replacement of major components of up to 21 home systems and appliances, including electrical, plumbing, central HVAC systems, water heaters, refrigerators, dishwashers and ranges/ovens/cooktops. We serve over two million customers annually across all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $1,258 million, $125 million, and $238 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $1,157 million, $160 million, and $259 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $1,020 million, $124 million, and $218 million, respectively.\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our total operating revenue included 66 percent of revenue derived from existing customer renewals, while 21 percent and 12 percent were derived from new unit sales made in conjunction with existing home resale transactions and direct-to-consumer sales, respectively, and one percent was derived from other revenue streams, principally cancellation fees. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our total operating revenue included 66 percent of revenue derived from existing customer renewals, while 22 percent and 12 percent were derived from new unit sales made in conjunction with existing home resale transactions and direct-to-consumer sales, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our total operating revenue included 66 percent of revenue derived from existing customer renewals, while 20 percent and 14 percent were derived from new unit sales made in conjunction with existing home resale transactions and direct-to-consumer sales, respectively.\n\ufeff\nThe Spin-off\n\ufeff\nOn July 26, 2017, ServiceMaster announced its intention to effectuate the Spin-off. The audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the periods prior to the Spin-off represent, on a historical cost basis, the combined assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses related to ServiceMaster's businesses operated under the American Home Shield, HSA, OneGuard and Landmark brand names (the Separated Business\u201d). Frontdoor was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ServiceMaster on January 2, 2018 for the purpose of holding the Separated Business in connection with the Spin-off. During 2018, ServiceMaster contributed the Separated Business to Frontdoor. On October 1, 2018, the Spin-off was completed by a pro rata distribution to ServiceMaster's stockholders of approximately 80.2% of our common stock. Each holder of ServiceMaster common stock received one share of our common stock for every two shares of ServiceMaster common stock held at the close of business on September 14, 2018, the record date of the distribution. The Spin-off was completed pursuant to a separation and distribution agreement and other agreements with ServiceMaster related to the Spin-off, including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, and a stockholders and registration rights agreement. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements for information related to these agreements.\n\ufeff\nOur financial statements include nonrecurring costs incurred to evaluate, plan and execute the Spin-off. These costs are primarily related to third-party consulting and other incremental costs directly associated with the Spin-off process. Our results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 include Spin-off charges of $24 million and $13 million, respectively. In addition, incremental capital expenditures required to effect the Spin-off in 2018 were $15 million, principally reflecting costs to replicate information technology systems historically shared with ServiceMaster. We expect to incur less than $1 million of Spin-off charges in 2019, which will primarily include costs related to services provided under the transition services agreement.\n\ufeff\nThe Spin-off has resulted in increased operating costs, which could be material to our results of operations. These increased costs are primarily associated with corporate functions such as finance, legal, information technology and human resources. We are currently evaluating the optimal structure of corporate functions to support the strategic objectives of our business as an independent public entity subsequent to the Spin-off. During 2018, we incurred $4 million of dis-synergies. For the full year 2019, we currently project an approximately $3 million increase in dis-synergies compared to 2018 for an annualized increase in operating costs of approximately $7 million, which we expect to then represent our normal operating costs associated with these dis-synergies.\n\ufeff\nOur financial position, results of operations and cash flows may not be indicative of our condition had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented, nor are the results stated herein necessarily indicative of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows had we operated as a separate, independent company during the periods presented. The audited consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for periods prior to the Spin-off do not reflect any changes that occurred in our financing and operations as a result of the Spin-off.\n\ufeff\nThe audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for periods prior to the Spin-off include all revenues, costs, assets and liabilities directly attributable to us. ServiceMaster's debt and corresponding interest expense have not been allocated to us for periods prior to the Spin-off since we were not the obligor of the debt. The audited consolidated and combined financial statements of operations and comprehensive income include allocations of certain costs from ServiceMaster incurred on our behalf. Such corporate-level costs are being allocated to us using methods based on proportionate formulas such as revenue, headcount, and others. Such corporate costs include costs pertaining to: accounting and finance, legal, human resources, information technology, insurance, marketing, tax services, procurement services and other costs. We consider the expense allocation methodology and results to be reasonable for all periods presented. However, these allocations may not be indicative of the actual level of expense that we would have incurred if we had operated as a separate stand-alone, publicly traded company during the periods presented nor are these costs necessarily indicative of costs we may incur in the future.\n\ufeff\nKey Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nMacroeconomic Conditions\n\ufeff\nMacroeconomic conditions that may affect customer spending patterns, and thereby our results of operations, include home sales, consumer confidence and employment rates. We believe our ability to acquire customers through the DTC channel mitigates the effect of a downturn in the real estate market, while our nationwide presence limits the risk of poor economic conditions in any particular geography.\n\ufeff\nSeasonality\n\ufeff\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which drives variations in our revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA for interim periods. Seasonal fluctuations are primarily driven by a higher number of central HVAC orders in the summer months. In 2018, approximately 20 percent, 28 percent, 30 percent and 22 percent of our revenue, approximately 11 percent, 36 percent, 40 percent and 13 percent of our net income, and approximately 13 percent, 31 percent, 36 percent and 20 percent of our Adjusted EBITDA was recognized in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively.\n\ufeff\nEffect of Weather Conditions\n\ufeff\nThe demand for our services, and our results of operations, are affected by weather conditions. Extreme temperatures can lead to an increase in service requests related to home systems, particularly central HVAC systems, resulting in higher claim frequency and costs and lower profitability. For example, we experienced an increase in contract claims cost driven by a higher number of central HVAC work orders as a result of colder winter temperatures in the first quarter of 2018 and higher summer temperatures in the second and third quarters of 2018 as compared to historical averages. Weather conditions that have a potentially favorable impact to our business include mild winters or summers, which can lead to lower home systems claim frequency.\n\ufeff\nWhile weather variations as described above may affect our business, major weather events and other Acts of God, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, typically do not increase our obligations to provide service. As a rule, repairs associated with such isolated events are addressed by homeowners' and other forms of insurance as opposed to home service plans that we offer, and such insurance coverage in fact reduces our obligations to provide service to systems and appliances damaged by insured, catastrophic events.\n\ufeff\nTariff and Import/Export Regulations\n\ufeff\nChanges in U.S. tariff and import/export regulations may impact the costs of home systems, appliances and repair parts. Import duties or restrictions on components and raw materials that are imposed, or the perception that they could occur, may materially and adversely affect our business by increasing our costs. For example, rising costs due to blanket tariffs on imported steel and aluminum could increase the costs of our home systems, appliances and repair parts.\n\ufeff\nCompetition\n\ufeff\nWe compete in the home service plan industry and the broader U.S. home services market. The home service plan industry is a highly competitive industry. The principal methods of competition, and by which we differentiate ourselves from our competitors, are quality and speed of service, contract offerings, brand awareness and reputation, customer satisfaction, pricing and promotions, contractor network and referrals.\n\ufeff\nAcquisition Activity\n\ufeff\nWe have a track record of sourcing and purchasing targets at attractive prices and successfully integrating them into our business, including the acquisitions of OneGuard and Landmark in 2016. We anticipate that the highly fragmented nature of the home service plan industry will continue to create opportunities for further consolidation. We use acquisitions to cost-effectively grow our home service plan contract count and deepen our customer base in high-growth geographies and may consider strategic acquisitions that will expand our reach into the home services market.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\ufeff\nTo supplement our results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have disclosed non-GAAP financial measures of operating results that exclude or adjust certain items. We present within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA. See Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d for a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information for its and investors' evaluation of our business performance and is useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of our business. While we believe this non-GAAP financial measure is useful in evaluating our business, it should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP financial measure may not be the same as similarly entitled measures reported by other companies.\n\ufeff\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Reform\n\ufeff\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. Tax Reform was signed into law. This legislation included numerous changes to existing tax law, including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, which has reduced our effective tax rate and cash tax payments, beginning in 2018. The rate reduction took effect on January 1, 2018; however, U.S. Tax Reform was signed in 2017 and had an immediate one-time effect of an income tax benefit of $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. See Note 5 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details.\n\ufeff\nKey Business Metrics\n\ufeff\nWe focus on a variety of indicators and key operating and financial metrics to monitor the financial condition, performance and cash flows of the continuing operations of our business. These metrics include:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nrevenue,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\noperating expenses,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nnet income,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nearnings per share,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nnet cash provided from operating activities,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFree Cash Flow,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncustomer retention rate, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ngrowth in number of home service plans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nRevenue. Home service plan contracts are typically one year in duration. We recognize revenue at the agreed upon contractual amount over time using the input method in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the contracts. Our revenue is primarily a function of the volume and pricing of the services provided to our customers, as well as the mix of services provided. Our revenue volume is impacted by new unit sales, customer retention and acquisitions. We derive all of our revenue from customers in the United States.\n\ufeff\nOperating Expenses. In addition to changes in our revenue, our operating results are affected by, among other things, the level of our operating expenses. Our operating expenses primarily include contract claims costs and expenses associated with sales and marketing, customer service and general corporate overhead. A number of our operating expenses are subject to inflationary pressures, such as: wages and salaries, employee benefits and health care; contractor costs; home systems, appliances and repair costs; tariffs; insurance premiums; and various regulatory compliance costs.\n\ufeff\nNet Income and Earnings Per Share. The presentation of net income and basic and diluted earnings per share provides measures of performance which are useful for investors, analysts and other interested parties in company-to-company operating performance comparisons. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, increased to include the number of shares of common stock that would have been outstanding had potentially dilutive shares of common stock been issued. The dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) are reflected in diluted net income per share by applying the treasury stock method.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA. We evaluate performance and allocate resources based primarily on Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before: provision for income taxes; interest expense; interest income from affiliate; depreciation and amortization expense; non-cash stock-based compensation expense; restructuring charges; Spin-off charges; affiliate royalty expense; (gain) loss on insured home service plan claims; and other non-operating expenses. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors, analysts and other interested parties as it facilitates company-to-company operating performance comparisons by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures, taxation, the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment, restructuring initiatives, Spin-off charges, arrangements with affiliates and equity-based, long-term incentive plans.\n\ufeff\nNet Cash Provided from Operating Activities and Free Cash Flow. We focus on measures designed to monitor cash flow, including net cash provided from operating activities and Free Cash Flow, which is a financial measure not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and represents net cash provided from operating activities less property additions.\n\ufeff\nCustomer Retention Rate and Growth in Number of Home Service Plans. We report our customer retention rate and growth in number of home service plans in order to track the performance of our business. Home service plans represent our recurring customer base, which includes customers with active contracts for recurring services. Our customer retention rate is calculated as the ratio of ending home service plans to the sum of beginning home service plans, new unit sales and acquired accounts for the applicable period. These measures are presented on a rolling, 12-month basis in order to avoid seasonal anomalies.\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\ufeff\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d is based upon our audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, contract claims costs, the impairment analysis for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, share-based compensation, income taxes, tax contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\ufeff\nWe believe the following accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most significant judgments and estimates.\n\ufeff\nRevenue Recognition\n\ufeff\nHome service plan contracts are typically one year in duration. We recognize revenue at the agreed upon contractual amount over time using the input method in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the contracts. Those costs bear a direct relationship to the fulfillment of our obligations under the contracts and are representative of the relative value provided to the customer (proportional performance method).\n\ufeff\nAt contract inception, we assess the goods and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a good or service (or a bundle of goods and services) that is distinct. To identify the performance obligation, we consider all of the goods and services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices.\n\ufeff\nHome Service Plan Claims Accruals\n\ufeff\nHome service plan claims costs are expensed as incurred. Accruals for home service plan claims are made based on our claims experience and actuarial projections. Accruals are established based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle claims. Home service plan claims take about three months to settle, on average, and substantially all claims are settled within six months of incurrence. The amount of time required to settle a claim can vary based on a number of factors, including whether a replacement is ultimately required. Our actuary performs an accrual analysis utilizing generally accepted actuarial methods that incorporate cumulative historical claims experience and information provided by us. We regularly review our estimates of claims costs and adjust the estimates when appropriate. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured. Nevertheless, changes in claims costs can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities.\n\ufeff\nCorporate Expense Allocation\n\ufeff\nOur audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include transactions with ServiceMaster for services (such as executive functions, information systems, accounting and finance, human resources, and legal and general corporate expenses) that were provided to us by the centralized ServiceMaster organization. Corporate level items also include personnel-related expenses of corporate employees (such as salaries, insurance coverage, stock-based compensation costs, etc.). Throughout the periods prior to the Spin-off covered by the financial statements, the costs of such functions, services and items have been directly charged or allocated to us using methods management believes are reasonable. The methods for allocating functions, services, and items to us are based on proportional allocation bases which include revenue, headcount and others. All such costs have been deemed to have been incurred and settled in the period where the costs were recorded.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes\n\ufeff\nFor purposes of our audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for periods prior to the Spin-off our taxes are provided for on a separate return\u201d basis, although our operations for the period prior to the completion of the Spin-off have historically been included in the tax returns filed by ServiceMaster. Income taxes as presented therein allocate current and deferred income taxes of the business to us in a manner that is systematic, rational, and consistent with the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740. Accordingly, as stated in paragraph 30 of ASC 740, the sum of the amounts allocated to the carve-out tax provisions may not equal the historical consolidated provision for us. Under the separate return method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates is accounted for in the period of enactment. The settlement of tax obligations is assumed in the period incurred and included in net parent investment for periods prior to the completion of the Spin-off.\n\ufeff\nOn October 1, 2018 Frontdoor and its subsidiaries began filing consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns. State and local returns are filed both on a separate company basis and on a combined unitary basis with Frontdoor. Current and deferred income taxes are provided for on a separate company basis. We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns.\n\ufeff\nWe record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns. We recognize potential interest and penalties related to its uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\n\ufeff\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n\ufeff\nIn accordance with applicable accounting standards, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are subject to assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value based test on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment. An assessment for impairment is performed on October 1 of every year. There were no goodwill or trade name impairment charges recorded during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016.\n\ufeff\nNewly Issued Accounting Standards\n\ufeff\nNew accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly impact our reported results and the comparability of our financial statements. See Note 2 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on newly issued accounting standards.\n\ufeff\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

The increase in customer service costs was primarily driven by incremental investments in customer care centers to deliver an improved level of customer service. Incremental ongoing costs related to the Spin-off of $4 million were incurred, which primarily related to the separation of information technology systems historically shared with ServiceMaster. Other includes an increase in professional fees of $4 million.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation Expense\n\ufeff\nDepreciation expense was $12 million and $9 million in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

These charges include nonrecurring costs incurred to evaluate, plan and execute the Spin-off. In 2018, Spin-off charges primarily comprised $19 million of third-party consulting fees and $5 million of other incremental costs directly related to the Spin-off process. In 2017, Spin-off charges primarily comprised $12 million of third-party consulting fees and $1 million of other incremental costs directly related to the Spin-off process.\n\ufeff\nAffiliate Royalty Expense\n\ufeff\nAffiliate royalty expense represents royalty expense with ServiceMaster for the use of their trade names. We incurred royalty expense of $1 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease was due to the termination of the trademark license agreement with ServiceMaster in connection with the Spin-off. We will not incur these expenses in future periods.\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\nInterest expense was $23 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in interest expense was driven by our financing transactions totaling $1 billion that occurred in 2018 in connection with the Spin-off. See Note 13 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details.\n\ufeff\nInterest Income from Affiliate\n\ufeff\nInterest income from affiliate was $2 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and represents interest earned on interest-bearing related party notes receivable included within Net parent investment in the audited consolidated and combined statements of financial position included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These notes were settled concurrently with the consummation of the Spin-off.\n\ufeff\nInterest and Net Investment Income\n\ufeff\nInterest and net investment income was $2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and was composed of net investment gains and interest and dividend income realized on our investment portfolio.\n\ufeff\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nThe effective tax rate on income was 25.1 percent and 27.2 percent for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rates on income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were reduced primarily by the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. See Note 5 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details\n\ufeff\nOur audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not reflect any amounts due to ServiceMaster for income tax related matters as it is assumed that all such amounts due to ServiceMaster were settled at the end of each reporting period.\n\ufeff\nNet Income\n\ufeff\nOur net income was $125 million and $160 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $36 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2018 was driven by the aforementioned operating results, offset, in part, by an $18 million decrease in the provision for income taxes as a result of lower pre-tax income and U.S. Tax Reform.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\ufeff\nThe following table provides a summary of changes in our Adjusted EBITDA.

Additionally, the impact of higher replacements, primarily appliances, in 2018 increased claims costs by $15 million. Results also include a net $3 million adjustment related to adverse development of prior year claims.\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the increase in sales and marketing costs was driven by targeted spending to drive sales growth. The increase in customer service costs was primarily driven by incremental investments in customer care centers to deliver an improved level of customer service. Incremental ongoing costs related to the Spin-off of $4 million were incurred, which primarily related to the separation of information technology systems historically shared with ServiceMaster. Other primarily includes an increase in professional fees of $4 million and an increase in bad debt expense of $2 million.\n\ufeff\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and

We incurred incremental selling and administrative expenses as a result of the OneGuard and Landmark acquisitions. The increase in customer service costs was due to higher labor costs resulting from an acceleration of pre-season hiring and training in preparation for the high-volume summer season and an overall increase in call center staffing levels to improve response times.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation Expense\n\ufeff\nDepreciation expense was $9 million and $8 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased property and equipment that resulted from the acquisitions of OneGuard and Landmark in 2016.\n\ufeff\nAmortization Expense\n\ufeff\nAmortization expense was $8 million and $6 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to additional amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets that resulted from the acquisitions of OneGuard and Landmark in 2016.\n\ufeff\nRestructuring Charges\n\ufeff\nWe incurred restructuring charges of $7 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\ufeff\nIn 2017, restructuring charges comprised $5 million of severance costs which primarily represent an allocation of severance costs and stock-based compensation expense as part of the severance agreement with ServiceMaster's former CEO and CFO, and allocations of $1 million of lease termination costs and $1 million of asset write-off and other costs related to the relocation to our corporate headquarters.\n\ufeff\nIn 2016, restructuring charges comprised $1 million of severance and other costs related to an initiative to enhance capabilities and reduce costs in ServiceMaster's headquarters functions that provided administrative services for our operations, $1 million of lease termination and other costs related to the decision to consolidate the stand-alone operations of Home Security of America, Inc. ( HSA\u201d), acquired in February 2014, with those of the American Home Shield business and $1 million of charges related to the disposal of certain HSA property and equipment.\n\ufeff\nSpin-Off Charges\n\ufeff\nWe incurred Spin-off charges of $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges include nonrecurring costs incurred to evaluate, plan and execute the Spin-off and comprised $12 million of third-party consulting fees and $1 million of other incremental costs related to Spin-off process.\n\ufeff\nAffiliate Royalty Expense\n\ufeff\nAffiliate royalty expense represents royalty expense with ServiceMaster for the use of their trade names. We incurred royalty expense of $2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\nInterest expense was $1 million and less than $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and represents interest expense on seller financed debt that was used to fund a portion of the acquisitions of OneGuard and Landmark as well as the interest expense on capital lease obligations.\n\ufeff\nInterest Income from Affiliate\n\ufeff\nInterest income from affiliate was $3 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and represents interest earned on interest-bearing related party notes receivable included within Net parent investment in the audited consolidated and combined statements of financial position included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nInterest and Net Investment Income\n\ufeff\nInterest and net investment income was $2 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and was composed of net investment gains and interest and dividend income realized on our investment portfolio. The decrease in 2017 was primarily the result of sales of marketable securities that occurred in 2016.\n\ufeff\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nOur effective tax rate on income was 27.2 percent and 36.6 percent for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate on income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was favorably impacted by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the 2018 reduction to the federal tax rate. Additional information on income taxes, including our effective tax rate reconciliation and liabilities for uncertain tax positions, can be found in Note 5 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\ufeff\nOur financial statements for periods prior to the Spin-off do not reflect any amounts due to ServiceMaster for income tax related matters as it is assumed that all such amounts due to ServiceMaster were settled on December 31 of each year.\n\ufeff\nNet Income\n\ufeff\nOur net income was $160 million and $124 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $36 million increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven by the aforementioned operating results and an $11 million decrease in the provision for income taxes.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\ufeff\nThe following table provides a summary of changes in our Adjusted EBITDA.

The increase in sales and marketing costs was driven by increased sales commissions and incremental marketing spending to drive growth. We incurred incremental selling and administrative expenses as a result of the OneGuard and Landmark acquisitions. The increase in customer service costs was due to higher labor costs resulting from an acceleration of pre-season hiring and training in preparation for the high-volume summer season and an overall increase in call center staffing levels to improve response times. The decrease in interest and net investment income was primarily the result of sales of marketable securities that occurred in 2016.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\ufeff\nLiquidity\n\ufeff\nA substantial portion of our liquidity needs are due to debt service requirements on our indebtedness. The Credit Agreement, as well as the Indenture, contain covenants that limit or restrict our ability, including the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness, repurchase debt, incur liens, sell assets, make certain payments (including dividends) and enter into transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the covenants under the agreements that were in effect on such date.\n\ufeff\nHistorically, the primary source of liquidity for our business has been the cash flow provided by operations which was, prior to the Spin-off, transferred to ServiceMaster to support its overall cash management strategy. Prior to the Spin-off, transfers of cash to and from ServiceMaster have been reflected in Net Parent Investment in the historical combined statements of financial position and combined statements of cash flows. ServiceMaster's cash has not been assigned to us for any of the periods prior to the Spin-off presented in the audited consolidated and combined statements of financial position included in Part 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K because those cash balances are not directly attributable to us.\n\ufeff\nIn connection with the Spin-off, our capital structure and sources of liquidity have changed significantly from our historical capital structure. We no longer participate in cash management with ServiceMaster, but rather our ability to fund our cash needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate and raise cash in the future. Although we believe that our future cash provided from operations, together with available capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility and our access to capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund our operating and financing needs, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) our credit rating, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (iii) the current state of the economy. Moreover, to preserve the tax-free treatment of the Spin-off, we may not be able to engage in certain strategic or capital-raising transactions following the Spin-off, such as issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, which may limit our access to capital markets, ability to raise capital through equity issuances, and ability to make acquisitions using our equity as currency, potentially requiring us to issue more debt than would otherwise be optimal. There can be no assurances that we will continue to have access to capital markets on terms acceptable to us. See Risk Factors\u201d included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion.\n\ufeff\nCash and short- and long-term marketable securities totaled $305 million and $309 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, there were no letters of credit outstanding and there was $250 million of available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\ufeff\nIn connection with the Spin-off and effective as of October 1, 2018, the inter-company balance due to ServiceMaster of $144 million recorded in Due to Parent in the condensed combined statements of financial position at September 30, 2018 was settled in\ncash with ServiceMaster. Additionally, in connection with the Spin-off and effective as of October 1, 2018, ServiceMaster contributed $81 million of cash to us. The effect of these transactions was a net reduction of Cash and cash equivalents of $63 million.\n\ufeff\nCash and short- and long-term marketable securities include balances associated with regulatory requirements in our business. See -Limitations on Distributions and Dividends by Subsidiaries.\u201d Our investment portfolio has been invested in high-quality debt securities. We closely monitor the performance of these investments. From time to time, we review the statutory reserve requirements to which our regulated entities are subject and any changes to such requirements. These reviews may result in identifying current reserve levels above or below minimum statutory reserve requirements, in which case we may adjust our reserves. The reviews may also identify opportunities to satisfy certain regulatory reserve requirements through alternate financial vehicles.\n\ufeff\nWe may from time to time repurchase or otherwise retire or extend our debt and/or take other steps to reduce our debt or otherwise improve our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. These actions may include open market debt repurchases, negotiated repurchases, other retirements of outstanding debt and/or opportunistic refinancing of debt. The amount of debt that may be repurchased or otherwise retired or refinanced, if any, and the price of such repurchases, retirements or refinancings will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, our cash position, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations.\n\ufeff\nCredit Facilities and Senior Notes\n\ufeff\nOn August 16, 2018, in connection with the Spin-off, we entered into the $650 million Term Loan Facility and the $250 million Revolving Credit Facility and issued $350 million of 2026 Notes. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and the 2026 Notes were incurred as partial consideration for the contribution of the Separated Business to us. We did not receive any cash proceeds as a result of these transactions.\n\ufeff\nOn October 24, 2018, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective October 31, 2018 that expires on August 16, 2025. The notional amount of the agreement was $350 million. Under the terms of the agreement, we will pay a fixed rate of interest of 3.0865% on the $350 million notional amount, and we will receive a floating rate of interest (based on one-month LIBOR, subject to a floor of zero percent) on the notional amount. Therefore, during the term of the agreement, the effective interest rate on $350 million of the Term Loan Facility is fixed at a rate of 3.0865%, plus the incremental borrowing margin of 2.50%.\n\ufeff\nLimitations on Distributions and Dividends by Subsidiaries\n\ufeff\nWe depend on our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us so that we may pay obligations and expenses, including satisfying obligations with respect to indebtedness. The ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions and dividends to us depends on their operating results, cash requirements, financial condition and general business conditions, as well as restrictions under the laws of our subsidiaries' jurisdictions.\n\ufeff\nOur subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of the Credit Agreement and other indebtedness to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict or prohibit the making of distributions, the payment of dividends or the making of loans by such subsidiaries to us.\n\ufeff\nFurthermore, there are third-party restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. These restrictions are related to regulatory requirements. The payments of ordinary and extraordinary dividends by certain of our subsidiaries (through which we conduct our business) are subject to significant regulatory restrictions under the laws and regulations of the states in which they operate. Among other things, such laws and regulations require certain subsidiaries to maintain minimum capital and net worth requirements and may limit the amount of ordinary and extraordinary dividends and other payments that these subsidiaries can pay to us. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total net assets subject to these third-party restrictions was $187 million and $169 million, respectively. We expect that such limitations will be in effect for the foreseeable future. In Texas, we are relieved of the obligation to post 75 percent of our otherwise required reserves because we operate a captive insurer approved by Texas regulators in order to satisfy such obligations. None of our subsidiaries are obligated to make funds available to us through the payment of dividends.\n\ufeff\nCash Flows\n\ufeff\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, as reflected in the audited consolidated and combined statements of cash flows included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are summarized in the following table.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided from (used for):\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>189 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>194 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>155 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(10) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(11) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(55) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(165) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(68) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(88) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash increase during the period\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>14 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>114 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>12 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nOperating Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided from operating activities was $189 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $194 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $155 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided from operating activities in 2018 comprised $157 million in earnings adjusted for non-cash charges and a $32 million decrease in cash required for working capital.

In 2018, capital expenditures required to effect the Spin-off were $15 million, principally reflecting costs to replicate information technology systems historically shared with ServiceMaster. We expect capital expenditures for the full year 2019 relating to recurring capital needs and the continuation of investments in information systems and productivity enhancing technology to be approximately $30 million to $40 million. We have no additional material capital commitments at this time.\n\ufeff\nThere were no cash payments for acquisitions in 2018 and 2017, compared with $87 million in 2016.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\ufeff\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and the audited consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. The cautionary statements discussed in Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read as applying to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nOverview\n\ufeff\nFrontdoor is the largest provider of home service plans in the United States, as measured by revenue, and operates under the American Home Shield, HSA, OneGuard and Landmark brands. Our home service plans help our customers maintain their homes and protect against costly and unexpected breakdowns of essential home systems and appliances. Our home service plan customers subscribe to a yearly service plan agreement that covers the repair or replacement of major components of up to 21 home systems and appliances, including electrical, plumbing, central HVAC systems, water heaters, refrigerators, dishwashers and ranges/ovens/cooktops. We serve over two million customers annually across all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $1,258 million, $125 million, and $238 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $1,157 million, $160 million, and $259 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $1,020 million, $124 million, and $218 million, respectively.\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our total operating revenue included 66 percent of revenue derived from existing customer renewals, while 21 percent and 12 percent were derived from new unit sales made in conjunction with existing home resale transactions and direct-to-consumer sales, respectively, and one percent was derived from other revenue streams, principally cancellation fees. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our total operating revenue included 66 percent of revenue derived from existing customer renewals, while 22 percent and 12 percent were derived from new unit sales made in conjunction with existing home resale transactions and direct-to-consumer sales, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our total operating revenue included 66 percent of revenue derived from existing customer renewals, while 20 percent and 14 percent were derived from new unit sales made in conjunction with existing home resale transactions and direct-to-consumer sales, respectively.\n\ufeff\nThe Spin-off\n\ufeff\nOn July 26, 2017, ServiceMaster announced its intention to effectuate the Spin-off. The audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the periods prior to the Spin-off represent, on a historical cost basis, the combined assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses related to ServiceMaster's businesses operated under the American Home Shield, HSA, OneGuard and Landmark brand names (the Separated Business\u201d). Frontdoor was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ServiceMaster on January 2, 2018 for the purpose of holding the Separated Business in connection with the Spin-off. During 2018, ServiceMaster contributed the Separated Business to Frontdoor. On October 1, 2018, the Spin-off was completed by a pro rata distribution to ServiceMaster's stockholders of approximately 80.2% of our common stock. Each holder of ServiceMaster common stock received one share of our common stock for every two shares of ServiceMaster common stock held at the close of business on September 14, 2018, the record date of the distribution. The Spin-off was completed pursuant to a separation and distribution agreement and other agreements with ServiceMaster related to the Spin-off, including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, and a stockholders and registration rights agreement. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements for information related to these agreements.\n\ufeff\nOur financial statements include nonrecurring costs incurred to evaluate, plan and execute the Spin-off. These costs are primarily related to third-party consulting and other incremental costs directly associated with the Spin-off process. Our results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 include Spin-off charges of $24 million and $13 million, respectively. In addition, incremental capital expenditures required to effect the Spin-off in 2018 were $15 million, principally reflecting costs to replicate information technology systems historically shared with ServiceMaster. We expect to incur less than $1 million of Spin-off charges in 2019, which will primarily include costs related to services provided under the transition services agreement.\n\ufeff\nThe Spin-off has resulted in increased operating costs, which could be material to our results of operations. These increased costs are primarily associated with corporate functions such as finance, legal, information technology and human resources. We are currently evaluating the optimal structure of corporate functions to support the strategic objectives of our business as an independent public entity subsequent to the Spin-off. During 2018, we incurred $4 million of dis-synergies. For the full year 2019, we currently project an approximately $3 million increase in dis-synergies compared to 2018 for an annualized increase in operating costs of approximately $7 million, which we expect to then represent our normal operating costs associated with these dis-synergies.\n\ufeff\nOur financial position, results of operations and cash flows may not be indicative of our condition had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented, nor are the results stated herein necessarily indicative of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows had we operated as a separate, independent company during the periods presented. The audited consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for periods prior to the Spin-off do not reflect any changes that occurred in our financing and operations as a result of the Spin-off.\n\ufeff\nThe audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for periods prior to the Spin-off include all revenues, costs, assets and liabilities directly attributable to us. ServiceMaster's debt and corresponding interest expense have not been allocated to us for periods prior to the Spin-off since we were not the obligor of the debt. The audited consolidated and combined financial statements of operations and comprehensive income include allocations of certain costs from ServiceMaster incurred on our behalf. Such corporate-level costs are being allocated to us using methods based on proportionate formulas such as revenue, headcount, and others. Such corporate costs include costs pertaining to: accounting and finance, legal, human resources, information technology, insurance, marketing, tax services, procurement services and other costs. We consider the expense allocation methodology and results to be reasonable for all periods presented. However, these allocations may not be indicative of the actual level of expense that we would have incurred if we had operated as a separate stand-alone, publicly traded company during the periods presented nor are these costs necessarily indicative of costs we may incur in the future.\n\ufeff\nKey Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nMacroeconomic Conditions\n\ufeff\nMacroeconomic conditions that may affect customer spending patterns, and thereby our results of operations, include home sales, consumer confidence and employment rates. We believe our ability to acquire customers through the DTC channel mitigates the effect of a downturn in the real estate market, while our nationwide presence limits the risk of poor economic conditions in any particular geography.\n\ufeff\nSeasonality\n\ufeff\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which drives variations in our revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA for interim periods. Seasonal fluctuations are primarily driven by a higher number of central HVAC orders in the summer months. In 2018, approximately 20 percent, 28 percent, 30 percent and 22 percent of our revenue, approximately 11 percent, 36 percent, 40 percent and 13 percent of our net income, and approximately 13 percent, 31 percent, 36 percent and 20 percent of our Adjusted EBITDA was recognized in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively.\n\ufeff\nEffect of Weather Conditions\n\ufeff\nThe demand for our services, and our results of operations, are affected by weather conditions. Extreme temperatures can lead to an increase in service requests related to home systems, particularly central HVAC systems, resulting in higher claim frequency and costs and lower profitability. For example, we experienced an increase in contract claims cost driven by a higher number of central HVAC work orders as a result of colder winter temperatures in the first quarter of 2018 and higher summer temperatures in the second and third quarters of 2018 as compared to historical averages. Weather conditions that have a potentially favorable impact to our business include mild winters or summers, which can lead to lower home systems claim frequency.\n\ufeff\nWhile weather variations as described above may affect our business, major weather events and other Acts of God, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, typically do not increase our obligations to provide service. As a rule, repairs associated with such isolated events are addressed by homeowners' and other forms of insurance as opposed to home service plans that we offer, and such insurance coverage in fact reduces our obligations to provide service to systems and appliances damaged by insured, catastrophic events.\n\ufeff\nTariff and Import/Export Regulations\n\ufeff\nChanges in U.S. tariff and import/export regulations may impact the costs of home systems, appliances and repair parts. Import duties or restrictions on components and raw materials that are imposed, or the perception that they could occur, may materially and adversely affect our business by increasing our costs. For example, rising costs due to blanket tariffs on imported steel and aluminum could increase the costs of our home systems, appliances and repair parts.\n\ufeff\nCompetition\n\ufeff\nWe compete in the home service plan industry and the broader U.S. home services market. The home service plan industry is a highly competitive industry. The principal methods of competition, and by which we differentiate ourselves from our competitors, are quality and speed of service, contract offerings, brand awareness and reputation, customer satisfaction, pricing and promotions, contractor network and referrals.\n\ufeff\nAcquisition Activity\n\ufeff\nWe have a track record of sourcing and purchasing targets at attractive prices and successfully integrating them into our business, including the acquisitions of OneGuard and Landmark in 2016. We anticipate that the highly fragmented nature of the home service plan industry will continue to create opportunities for further consolidation. We use acquisitions to cost-effectively grow our home service plan contract count and deepen our customer base in high-growth geographies and may consider strategic acquisitions that will expand our reach into the home services market.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\ufeff\nTo supplement our results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have disclosed non-GAAP financial measures of operating results that exclude or adjust certain items. We present within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA. See Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d for a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information for its and investors' evaluation of our business performance and is useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of our business. While we believe this non-GAAP financial measure is useful in evaluating our business, it should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP financial measure may not be the same as similarly entitled measures reported by other companies.\n\ufeff\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Reform\n\ufeff\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. Tax Reform was signed into law. This legislation included numerous changes to existing tax law, including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, which has reduced our effective tax rate and cash tax payments, beginning in 2018. The rate reduction took effect on January 1, 2018; however, U.S. Tax Reform was signed in 2017 and had an immediate one-time effect of an income tax benefit of $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. See Note 5 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details.\n\ufeff\nKey Business Metrics\n\ufeff\nWe focus on a variety of indicators and key operating and financial metrics to monitor the financial condition, performance and cash flows of the continuing operations of our business. These metrics include:\n \u00b7 revenue, \n \u00b7 operating expenses, \n \u00b7 net income, \n \u00b7 earnings per share, \n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA, \n \u00b7 net cash provided from operating activities, \n \u00b7 Free Cash Flow, \n \u00b7 customer retention rate, and \n \u00b7 growth in number of home service plans. \n\ufeff\nRevenue. Home service plan contracts are typically one year in duration. We recognize revenue at the agreed upon contractual amount over time using the input method in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the contracts. Our revenue is primarily a function of the volume and pricing of the services provided to our customers, as well as the mix of services provided. Our revenue volume is impacted by new unit sales, customer retention and acquisitions. We derive all of our revenue from customers in the United States.\n\ufeff\nOperating Expenses. In addition to changes in our revenue, our operating results are affected by, among other things, the level of our operating expenses. Our operating expenses primarily include contract claims costs and expenses associated with sales and marketing, customer service and general corporate overhead. A number of our operating expenses are subject to inflationary pressures, such as: wages and salaries, employee benefits and health care; contractor costs; home systems, appliances and repair costs; tariffs; insurance premiums; and various regulatory compliance costs.\n\ufeff\nNet Income and Earnings Per Share. The presentation of net income and basic and diluted earnings per share provides measures of performance which are useful for investors, analysts and other interested parties in company-to-company operating performance comparisons. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, increased to include the number of shares of common stock that would have been outstanding had potentially dilutive shares of common stock been issued. The dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) are reflected in diluted net income per share by applying the treasury stock method.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA. We evaluate performance and allocate resources based primarily on Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before: provision for income taxes; interest expense; interest income from affiliate; depreciation and amortization expense; non-cash stock-based compensation expense; restructuring charges; Spin-off charges; affiliate royalty expense; (gain) loss on insured home service plan claims; and other non-operating expenses. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors, analysts and other interested parties as it facilitates company-to-company operating performance comparisons by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures, taxation, the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment, restructuring initiatives, Spin-off charges, arrangements with affiliates and equity-based, long-term incentive plans.\n\ufeff\nNet Cash Provided from Operating Activities and Free Cash Flow. We focus on measures designed to monitor cash flow, including net cash provided from operating activities and Free Cash Flow, which is a financial measure not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and represents net cash provided from operating activities less property additions.\n\ufeff\nCustomer Retention Rate and Growth in Number of Home Service Plans. We report our customer retention rate and growth in number of home service plans in order to track the performance of our business. Home service plans represent our recurring customer base, which includes customers with active contracts for recurring services. Our customer retention rate is calculated as the ratio of ending home service plans to the sum of beginning home service plans, new unit sales and acquired accounts for the applicable period. These measures are presented on a rolling, 12-month basis in order to avoid seasonal anomalies.\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\ufeff\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d is based upon our audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, contract claims costs, the impairment analysis for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, share-based compensation, income taxes, tax contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\ufeff\nWe believe the following accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most significant judgments and estimates.\n\ufeff\nRevenue Recognition\n\ufeff\nHome service plan contracts are typically one year in duration. We recognize revenue at the agreed upon contractual amount over time using the input method in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the contracts. Those costs bear a direct relationship to the fulfillment of our obligations under the contracts and are representative of the relative value provided to the customer (proportional performance method).\n\ufeff\nAt contract inception, we assess the goods and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a good or service (or a bundle of goods and services) that is distinct. To identify the performance obligation, we consider all of the goods and services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices.\n\ufeff\nHome Service Plan Claims Accruals\n\ufeff\nHome service plan claims costs are expensed as incurred. Accruals for home service plan claims are made based on our claims experience and actuarial projections. Accruals are established based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle claims. Home service plan claims take about three months to settle, on average, and substantially all claims are settled within six months of incurrence. The amount of time required to settle a claim can vary based on a number of factors, including whether a replacement is ultimately required. Our actuary performs an accrual analysis utilizing generally accepted actuarial methods that incorporate cumulative historical claims experience and information provided by us. We regularly review our estimates of claims costs and adjust the estimates when appropriate. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured. Nevertheless, changes in claims costs can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities.\n\ufeff\nCorporate Expense Allocation\n\ufeff\nOur audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include transactions with ServiceMaster for services (such as executive functions, information systems, accounting and finance, human resources, and legal and general corporate expenses) that were provided to us by the centralized ServiceMaster organization. Corporate level items also include personnel-related expenses of corporate employees (such as salaries, insurance coverage, stock-based compensation costs, etc.). Throughout the periods prior to the Spin-off covered by the financial statements, the costs of such functions, services and items have been directly charged or allocated to us using methods management believes are reasonable. The methods for allocating functions, services, and items to us are based on proportional allocation bases which include revenue, headcount and others. All such costs have been deemed to have been incurred and settled in the period where the costs were recorded.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes\n\ufeff\nFor purposes of our audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for periods prior to the Spin-off our taxes are provided for on a separate return\u201d basis, although our operations for the period prior to the completion of the Spin-off have historically been included in the tax returns filed by ServiceMaster. Income taxes as presented therein allocate current and deferred income taxes of the business to us in a manner that is systematic, rational, and consistent with the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740. Accordingly, as stated in paragraph 30 of ASC 740, the sum of the amounts allocated to the carve-out tax provisions may not equal the historical consolidated provision for us. Under the separate return method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates is accounted for in the period of enactment. The settlement of tax obligations is assumed in the period incurred and included in net parent investment for periods prior to the completion of the Spin-off.\n\ufeff\nOn October 1, 2018 Frontdoor and its subsidiaries began filing consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns. State and local returns are filed both on a separate company basis and on a combined unitary basis with Frontdoor. Current and deferred income taxes are provided for on a separate company basis. We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns.\n\ufeff\nWe record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns. We recognize potential interest and penalties related to its uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\n\ufeff\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n\ufeff\nIn accordance with applicable accounting standards, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are subject to assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value based test on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment. An assessment for impairment is performed on October 1 of every year. There were no goodwill or trade name impairment charges recorded during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016.\n\ufeff\nNewly Issued Accounting Standards\n\ufeff\nNew accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly impact our reported results and the comparability of our financial statements. See Note 2 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on newly issued accounting standards.\n\ufeff\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n________________________________\n* not meaningful\nRevenue\n\ufeff\nWe reported revenue of $1,258 million and $1,157 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Revenue by major customer acquisition channel is as follows:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n_________________________________\n* not meaningful\n\ufeff\nRevenue increased nine percent for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by higher renewal revenue due to overall growth in the number of home service plans as well as improved price realization. The increase in real estate revenue reflects improved price realization, primarily due to a mix shift to higher priced home service plan offerings. The increase in direct-to-consumer revenue reflects growth in new sales resulting from increased investments in marketing.\n\ufeff\nGrowth in number of home service plans and customer retention rate are presented below.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nCost of Services Rendered\n\ufeff\nWe reported cost of services rendered of $686 million and $589 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The following table provides a summary of changes in cost of services rendered:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n___________________________________\n (1) Represents the gain on an arrangement with a captive insurance affiliate of our former parent whereby certain American Home Shield home service plan claims were insured prior to the Spin-off. Our relationship with this captive insurance affiliate was terminated in connection with the Spin-off. \n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the increase in contract claims includes an increase in the underlying costs of repairs totaling $23 million, particularly in the appliance and plumbing trades, as well as a higher number of work orders, primarily driven by colder winter temperatures in the first quarter and significantly warmer summer temperatures in the second and third quarters of 2018 as compared to historical averages, which increased claims costs by $17 million. Additionally, the impact of higher replacements, primarily appliances, in 2018 increased claims costs by $15 million. Results also include a net $3 million adjustment related to adverse development of prior year claims. Other includes an increase in bad debt expense of $2 million.\n\ufeff\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\n\ufeff\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we reported selling and administrative expenses of $338 million and $312 million, respectively, which comprised selling, marketing and customer service costs of $263 million and $245 million, respectively, and general and administrative expenses of $75 million and $67 million, respectively. The following table provides a summary of changes in selling and administrative expenses:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the increase in sales and marketing costs was driven by targeted spending to drive sales growth. The increase in customer service costs was primarily driven by incremental investments in customer care centers to deliver an improved level of customer service. Incremental ongoing costs related to the Spin-off of $4 million were incurred, which primarily related to the separation of information technology systems historically shared with ServiceMaster. Other includes an increase in professional fees of $4 million.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation Expense\n\ufeff\nDepreciation expense was $12 million and $9 million in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was primarily due to additional property and equipment related to the headquarters relocation and information technology costs related to the separation, principally reflecting costs to replicate information technology systems historically shared with ServiceMaster.\n\ufeff\nAmortization Expense\n\ufeff\nAmortization expense was $8 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n\ufeff\nRestructuring Charges\n\ufeff\nWe incurred restructuring charges of $3 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\ufeff\nIn 2018, restructuring charges comprised $2 million of non-personnel charges primarily related to the relocation to our corporate headquarters and $1 million of severance costs, which primarily represent an allocation of severance costs related to actions taken to enhance capabilities and reduce costs in ServiceMaster's corporate functions that provided company-wide administrative services to support operations.\n\ufeff\nIn 2017, restructuring charges comprised $5 million of severance costs which primarily represent an allocation of severance costs and stock-based compensation expense as part of the severance agreement with ServiceMaster's former CEO and CFO, and allocations of $1 million of lease termination costs and $1 million of asset write-off and other costs related to the relocation to our corporate headquarters.\n\ufeff\nSpin-Off Charges\n\ufeff\nWe incurred Spin-off charges of $24 million and $13 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These charges include nonrecurring costs incurred to evaluate, plan and execute the Spin-off. In 2018, Spin-off charges primarily comprised $19 million of third-party consulting fees and $5 million of other incremental costs directly related to the Spin-off process. In 2017, Spin-off charges primarily comprised $12 million of third-party consulting fees and $1 million of other incremental costs directly related to the Spin-off process.\n\ufeff\nAffiliate Royalty Expense\n\ufeff\nAffiliate royalty expense represents royalty expense with ServiceMaster for the use of their trade names. We incurred royalty expense of $1 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease was due to the termination of the trademark license agreement with ServiceMaster in connection with the Spin-off. We will not incur these expenses in future periods.\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\nInterest expense was $23 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in interest expense was driven by our financing transactions totaling $1 billion that occurred in 2018 in connection with the Spin-off. See Note 13 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details.\n\ufeff\nInterest Income from Affiliate\n\ufeff\nInterest income from affiliate was $2 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and represents interest earned on interest-bearing related party notes receivable included within Net parent investment in the audited consolidated and combined statements of financial position included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These notes were settled concurrently with the consummation of the Spin-off.\n\ufeff\nInterest and Net Investment Income\n\ufeff\nInterest and net investment income was $2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and was composed of net investment gains and interest and dividend income realized on our investment portfolio.\n\ufeff\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nThe effective tax rate on income was 25.1 percent and 27.2 percent for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rates on income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were reduced primarily by the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. See Note 5 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details\n\ufeff\nOur audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not reflect any amounts due to ServiceMaster for income tax related matters as it is assumed that all such amounts due to ServiceMaster were settled at the end of each reporting period.\n\ufeff\nNet Income\n\ufeff\nOur net income was $125 million and $160 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $36 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2018 was driven by the aforementioned operating results, offset, in part, by an $18 million decrease in the provision for income taxes as a result of lower pre-tax income and U.S. Tax Reform.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\ufeff\nThe following table provides a summary of changes in our Adjusted EBITDA. For a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\u201d\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the increase in contract claims includes an increase in the underlying costs of repairs totaling $23 million, particularly in the appliance and plumbing trades, as well as a higher number of work orders, primarily driven by colder winter temperatures in the first quarter and significantly warmer summer temperatures in the second and third quarters of 2018 as compared to historical averages, which increased claims costs by $17 million. Additionally, the impact of higher replacements, primarily appliances, in 2018 increased claims costs by $15 million. Results also include a net $3 million adjustment related to adverse development of prior year claims.\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the increase in sales and marketing costs was driven by targeted spending to drive sales growth. The increase in customer service costs was primarily driven by incremental investments in customer care centers to deliver an improved level of customer service. Incremental ongoing costs related to the Spin-off of $4 million were incurred, which primarily related to the separation of information technology systems historically shared with ServiceMaster. Other primarily includes an increase in professional fees of $4 million and an increase in bad debt expense of $2 million.\n\ufeff\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n___________________________________\n* not meaningful\nRevenue\n\ufeff\nWe reported revenue of $1,157 million and $1,020 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Revenue by major customer acquisition channel is as follows:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n_________________________________\n* not meaningful\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 and 2016 revenue results reflect an increase in new unit sales, improved price realization and approximately $56 million and $22 million, respectively, as a result of the OneGuard and Landmark acquisitions in 2016.\n\ufeff\nGrowth in number of home service plans and customer retention rate are presented below.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n___________________________________\n\ufeff\n (1) As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, excluding the impact of acquisitions, the growth in renewable home service plans was six percent and seven percent, respectively, and the customer retention rate was 76 percent and 75 percent, respectively. \nCost of Services Rendered\n\ufeff\nWe reported cost of services rendered of $589 million and $526 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The following table provides a summary of changes in cost of services rendered:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n___________________________________\n (1) Includes approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the acquisitions of OneGuard and Landmark in 2016. \n (2) Represents the gain on an arrangement with a captive insurance affiliate of our former parent whereby certain American Home Shield home service plan claims were insured prior to the Spin-off. \n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the increase in contract claims costs was primarily due to normal inflationary pressure on the underlying cost of repairs, offset, in part, by a lower number of work orders driven by cooler summer temperatures in 2017.\n\ufeff\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\n\ufeff\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we reported selling and administrative expenses of $312 million and $286 million, respectively, which comprised general and administrative expenses of $67 million and $68 million, respectively, and selling, marketing and customer service costs of $245 million and $218 million, respectively. The following table provides a summary of changes in selling and administrative expenses:\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the increase in sales and marketing costs was driven by increased sales commissions and incremental marketing spending to drive growth. We incurred incremental selling and administrative expenses as a result of the OneGuard and Landmark acquisitions. The increase in customer service costs was due to higher labor costs resulting from an acceleration of pre-season hiring and training in preparation for the high-volume summer season and an overall increase in call center staffing levels to improve response times.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation Expense\n\ufeff\nDepreciation expense was $9 million and $8 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased property and equipment that resulted from the acquisitions of OneGuard and Landmark in 2016.\n\ufeff\nAmortization Expense\n\ufeff\nAmortization expense was $8 million and $6 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to additional amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets that resulted from the acquisitions of OneGuard and Landmark in 2016.\n\ufeff\nRestructuring Charges\n\ufeff\nWe incurred restructuring charges of $7 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\ufeff\nIn 2017, restructuring charges comprised $5 million of severance costs which primarily represent an allocation of severance costs and stock-based compensation expense as part of the severance agreement with ServiceMaster's former CEO and CFO, and allocations of $1 million of lease termination costs and $1 million of asset write-off and other costs related to the relocation to our corporate headquarters.\n\ufeff\nIn 2016, restructuring charges comprised $1 million of severance and other costs related to an initiative to enhance capabilities and reduce costs in ServiceMaster's headquarters functions that provided administrative services for our operations, $1 million of lease termination and other costs related to the decision to consolidate the stand-alone operations of Home Security of America, Inc. ( HSA\u201d), acquired in February 2014, with those of the American Home Shield business and $1 million of charges related to the disposal of certain HSA property and equipment.\n\ufeff\nSpin-Off Charges\n\ufeff\nWe incurred Spin-off charges of $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges include nonrecurring costs incurred to evaluate, plan and execute the Spin-off and comprised $12 million of third-party consulting fees and $1 million of other incremental costs related to Spin-off process.\n\ufeff\nAffiliate Royalty Expense\n\ufeff\nAffiliate royalty expense represents royalty expense with ServiceMaster for the use of their trade names. We incurred royalty expense of $2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\nInterest expense was $1 million and less than $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and represents interest expense on seller financed debt that was used to fund a portion of the acquisitions of OneGuard and Landmark as well as the interest expense on capital lease obligations.\n\ufeff\nInterest Income from Affiliate\n\ufeff\nInterest income from affiliate was $3 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and represents interest earned on interest-bearing related party notes receivable included within Net parent investment in the audited consolidated and combined statements of financial position included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nInterest and Net Investment Income\n\ufeff\nInterest and net investment income was $2 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and was composed of net investment gains and interest and dividend income realized on our investment portfolio. The decrease in 2017 was primarily the result of sales of marketable securities that occurred in 2016.\n\ufeff\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nOur effective tax rate on income was 27.2 percent and 36.6 percent for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate on income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was favorably impacted by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the 2018 reduction to the federal tax rate. Additional information on income taxes, including our effective tax rate reconciliation and liabilities for uncertain tax positions, can be found in Note 5 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\ufeff\nOur financial statements for periods prior to the Spin-off do not reflect any amounts due to ServiceMaster for income tax related matters as it is assumed that all such amounts due to ServiceMaster were settled on December 31 of each year.\n\ufeff\nNet Income\n\ufeff\nOur net income was $160 million and $124 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $36 million increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven by the aforementioned operating results and an $11 million decrease in the provision for income taxes.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\ufeff\nThe following table provides a summary of changes in our Adjusted EBITDA. For a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\u201d\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\nThe increase in contract claims costs was primarily due to normal inflationary pressure on the underlying cost of repairs, offset, in part, by a lower number of work orders driven by cooler summer temperatures in 2017. The increase in sales and marketing costs was driven by increased sales commissions and incremental marketing spending to drive growth. We incurred incremental selling and administrative expenses as a result of the OneGuard and Landmark acquisitions. The increase in customer service costs was due to higher labor costs resulting from an acceleration of pre-season hiring and training in preparation for the high-volume summer season and an overall increase in call center staffing levels to improve response times. The decrease in interest and net investment income was primarily the result of sales of marketable securities that occurred in 2016.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\ufeff\nLiquidity\n\ufeff\nA substantial portion of our liquidity needs are due to debt service requirements on our indebtedness. The Credit Agreement, as well as the Indenture, contain covenants that limit or restrict our ability, including the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness, repurchase debt, incur liens, sell assets, make certain payments (including dividends) and enter into transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the covenants under the agreements that were in effect on such date.\n\ufeff\nHistorically, the primary source of liquidity for our business has been the cash flow provided by operations which was, prior to the Spin-off, transferred to ServiceMaster to support its overall cash management strategy. Prior to the Spin-off, transfers of cash to and from ServiceMaster have been reflected in Net Parent Investment in the historical combined statements of financial position and combined statements of cash flows. ServiceMaster's cash has not been assigned to us for any of the periods prior to the Spin-off presented in the audited consolidated and combined statements of financial position included in Part 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K because those cash balances are not directly attributable to us.\n\ufeff\nIn connection with the Spin-off, our capital structure and sources of liquidity have changed significantly from our historical capital structure. We no longer participate in cash management with ServiceMaster, but rather our ability to fund our cash needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate and raise cash in the future. Although we believe that our future cash provided from operations, together with available capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility and our access to capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund our operating and financing needs, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) our credit rating, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (iii) the current state of the economy. Moreover, to preserve the tax-free treatment of the Spin-off, we may not be able to engage in certain strategic or capital-raising transactions following the Spin-off, such as issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, which may limit our access to capital markets, ability to raise capital through equity issuances, and ability to make acquisitions using our equity as currency, potentially requiring us to issue more debt than would otherwise be optimal. There can be no assurances that we will continue to have access to capital markets on terms acceptable to us. See Risk Factors\u201d included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion.\n\ufeff\nCash and short- and long-term marketable securities totaled $305 million and $309 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, there were no letters of credit outstanding and there was $250 million of available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\ufeff\nIn connection with the Spin-off and effective as of October 1, 2018, the inter-company balance due to ServiceMaster of $144 million recorded in Due to Parent in the condensed combined statements of financial position at September 30, 2018 was settled in\ncash with ServiceMaster. Additionally, in connection with the Spin-off and effective as of October 1, 2018, ServiceMaster contributed $81 million of cash to us. The effect of these transactions was a net reduction of Cash and cash equivalents of $63 million.\n\ufeff\nCash and short- and long-term marketable securities include balances associated with regulatory requirements in our business. See -Limitations on Distributions and Dividends by Subsidiaries.\u201d Our investment portfolio has been invested in high-quality debt securities. We closely monitor the performance of these investments. From time to time, we review the statutory reserve requirements to which our regulated entities are subject and any changes to such requirements. These reviews may result in identifying current reserve levels above or below minimum statutory reserve requirements, in which case we may adjust our reserves. The reviews may also identify opportunities to satisfy certain regulatory reserve requirements through alternate financial vehicles.\n\ufeff\nWe may from time to time repurchase or otherwise retire or extend our debt and/or take other steps to reduce our debt or otherwise improve our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. These actions may include open market debt repurchases, negotiated repurchases, other retirements of outstanding debt and/or opportunistic refinancing of debt. The amount of debt that may be repurchased or otherwise retired or refinanced, if any, and the price of such repurchases, retirements or refinancings will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, our cash position, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations.\n\ufeff\nCredit Facilities and Senior Notes\n\ufeff\nOn August 16, 2018, in connection with the Spin-off, we entered into the $650 million Term Loan Facility and the $250 million Revolving Credit Facility and issued $350 million of 2026 Notes. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and the 2026 Notes were incurred as partial consideration for the contribution of the Separated Business to us. We did not receive any cash proceeds as a result of these transactions.\n\ufeff\nOn October 24, 2018, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective October 31, 2018 that expires on August 16, 2025. The notional amount of the agreement was $350 million. Under the terms of the agreement, we will pay a fixed rate of interest of 3.0865% on the $350 million notional amount, and we will receive a floating rate of interest (based on one-month LIBOR, subject to a floor of zero percent) on the notional amount. Therefore, during the term of the agreement, the effective interest rate on $350 million of the Term Loan Facility is fixed at a rate of 3.0865%, plus the incremental borrowing margin of 2.50%.\n\ufeff\nLimitations on Distributions and Dividends by Subsidiaries\n\ufeff\nWe depend on our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us so that we may pay obligations and expenses, including satisfying obligations with respect to indebtedness. The ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions and dividends to us depends on their operating results, cash requirements, financial condition and general business conditions, as well as restrictions under the laws of our subsidiaries' jurisdictions.\n\ufeff\nOur subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of the Credit Agreement and other indebtedness to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict or prohibit the making of distributions, the payment of dividends or the making of loans by such subsidiaries to us.\n\ufeff\nFurthermore, there are third-party restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. These restrictions are related to regulatory requirements. The payments of ordinary and extraordinary dividends by certain of our subsidiaries (through which we conduct our business) are subject to significant regulatory restrictions under the laws and regulations of the states in which they operate. Among other things, such laws and regulations require certain subsidiaries to maintain minimum capital and net worth requirements and may limit the amount of ordinary and extraordinary dividends and other payments that these subsidiaries can pay to us. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total net assets subject to these third-party restrictions was $187 million and $169 million, respectively. We expect that such limitations will be in effect for the foreseeable future. In Texas, we are relieved of the obligation to post 75 percent of our otherwise required reserves because we operate a captive insurer approved by Texas regulators in order to satisfy such obligations. None of our subsidiaries are obligated to make funds available to us through the payment of dividends.\n\ufeff\nCash Flows\n\ufeff\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, as reflected in the audited consolidated and combined statements of cash flows included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are summarized in the following table.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nOperating Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided from operating activities was $189 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\ufeff\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and the audited consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. The cautionary statements discussed in Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read as applying to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nOverview\n\ufeff\nFrontdoor is the largest provider of home service plans in the United States, as measured by revenue, and operates under the American Home Shield, HSA, OneGuard and Landmark brands. Our home service plans help our customers maintain their homes and protect against costly and unexpected breakdowns of essential home systems and appliances. Our home service plan customers subscribe to a yearly service plan agreement that covers the repair or replacement of major components of up to 21 home systems and appliances, including electrical, plumbing, central HVAC systems, water heaters, refrigerators, dishwashers and ranges/ovens/cooktops. We serve over two million customers annually across all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $1,258 million, $125 million, and $238 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $1,157 million, $160 million, and $259 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $1,020 million, $124 million, and $218 million, respectively.\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our total operating revenue included 66 percent of revenue derived from existing customer renewals, while 21 percent and 12 percent were derived from new unit sales made in conjunction with existing home resale transactions and direct-to-consumer sales, respectively, and one percent was derived from other revenue streams, principally cancellation fees. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our total operating revenue included 66 percent of revenue derived from existing customer renewals, while 22 percent and 12 percent were derived from new unit sales made in conjunction with existing home resale transactions and direct-to-consumer sales, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our total operating revenue included 66 percent of revenue derived from existing customer renewals, while 20 percent and 14 percent were derived from new unit sales made in conjunction with existing home resale transactions and direct-to-consumer sales, respectively.\n\ufeff\nThe Spin-off\n\ufeff\nOn July 26, 2017, ServiceMaster announced its intention to effectuate the Spin-off. The audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the periods prior to the Spin-off represent, on a historical cost basis, the combined assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses related to ServiceMaster's businesses operated under the American Home Shield, HSA, OneGuard and Landmark brand names (the Separated Business\u201d). Frontdoor was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ServiceMaster on January 2, 2018 for the purpose of holding the Separated Business in connection with the Spin-off. During 2018, ServiceMaster contributed the Separated Business to Frontdoor. On October 1, 2018, the Spin-off was completed by a pro rata distribution to ServiceMaster's stockholders of approximately 80.2% of our common stock. Each holder of ServiceMaster common stock received one share of our common stock for every two shares of ServiceMaster common stock held at the close of business on September 14, 2018, the record date of the distribution. The Spin-off was completed pursuant to a separation and distribution agreement and other agreements with ServiceMaster related to the Spin-off, including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, and a stockholders and registration rights agreement. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements for information related to these agreements.\n\ufeff\nOur financial statements include nonrecurring costs incurred to evaluate, plan and execute the Spin-off. These costs are primarily related to third-party consulting and other incremental costs directly associated with the Spin-off process. Our results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 include Spin-off charges of $24 million and $13 million, respectively. In addition, incremental capital expenditures required to effect the Spin-off in 2018 were $15 million, principally reflecting costs to replicate information technology systems historically shared with ServiceMaster. We expect to incur less than $1 million of Spin-off charges in 2019, which will primarily include costs related to services provided under the transition services agreement.\n\ufeff\nThe Spin-off has resulted in increased operating costs, which could be material to our results of operations. These increased costs are primarily associated with corporate functions such as finance, legal, information technology and human resources. We are currently evaluating the optimal structure of corporate functions to support the strategic objectives of our business as an independent public entity subsequent to the Spin-off. During 2018, we incurred $4 million of dis-synergies. For the full year 2019, we currently project an approximately $3 million increase in dis-synergies compared to 2018 for an annualized increase in operating costs of approximately $7 million, which we expect to then represent our normal operating costs associated with these dis-synergies.\n\ufeff\nOur financial position, results of operations and cash flows may not be indicative of our condition had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented, nor are the results stated herein necessarily indicative of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows had we operated as a separate, independent company during the periods presented. The audited consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for periods prior to the Spin-off do not reflect any changes that occurred in our financing and operations as a result of the Spin-off.\n\ufeff\nThe audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for periods prior to the Spin-off include all revenues, costs, assets and liabilities directly attributable to us. ServiceMaster's debt and corresponding interest expense have not been allocated to us for periods prior to the Spin-off since we were not the obligor of the debt. The audited consolidated and combined financial statements of operations and comprehensive income include allocations of certain costs from ServiceMaster incurred on our behalf. Such corporate-level costs are being allocated to us using methods based on proportionate formulas such as revenue, headcount, and others. Such corporate costs include costs pertaining to: accounting and finance, legal, human resources, information technology, insurance, marketing, tax services, procurement services and other costs. We consider the expense allocation methodology and results to be reasonable for all periods presented. However, these allocations may not be indicative of the actual level of expense that we would have incurred if we had operated as a separate stand-alone, publicly traded company during the periods presented nor are these costs necessarily indicative of costs we may incur in the future.\n\ufeff\nKey Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nMacroeconomic Conditions\n\ufeff\nMacroeconomic conditions that may affect customer spending patterns, and thereby our results of operations, include home sales, consumer confidence and employment rates. We believe our ability to acquire customers through the DTC channel mitigates the effect of a downturn in the real estate market, while our nationwide presence limits the risk of poor economic conditions in any particular geography.\n\ufeff\nSeasonality\n\ufeff\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which drives variations in our revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA for interim periods. Seasonal fluctuations are primarily driven by a higher number of central HVAC orders in the summer months. In 2018, approximately 20 percent, 28 percent, 30 percent and 22 percent of our revenue, approximately 11 percent, 36 percent, 40 percent and 13 percent of our net income, and approximately 13 percent, 31 percent, 36 percent and 20 percent of our Adjusted EBITDA was recognized in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively.\n\ufeff\nEffect of Weather Conditions\n\ufeff\nThe demand for our services, and our results of operations, are affected by weather conditions. Extreme temperatures can lead to an increase in service requests related to home systems, particularly central HVAC systems, resulting in higher claim frequency and costs and lower profitability. For example, we experienced an increase in contract claims cost driven by a higher number of central HVAC work orders as a result of colder winter temperatures in the first quarter of 2018 and higher summer temperatures in the second and third quarters of 2018 as compared to historical averages. Weather conditions that have a potentially favorable impact to our business include mild winters or summers, which can lead to lower home systems claim frequency.\n\ufeff\nWhile weather variations as described above may affect our business, major weather events and other Acts of God, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, typically do not increase our obligations to provide service. As a rule, repairs associated with such isolated events are addressed by homeowners' and other forms of insurance as opposed to home service plans that we offer, and such insurance coverage in fact reduces our obligations to provide service to systems and appliances damaged by insured, catastrophic events.\n\ufeff\nTariff and Import/Export Regulations\n\ufeff\nChanges in U.S. tariff and import/export regulations may impact the costs of home systems, appliances and repair parts. Import duties or restrictions on components and raw materials that are imposed, or the perception that they could occur, may materially and adversely affect our business by increasing our costs. For example, rising costs due to blanket tariffs on imported steel and aluminum could increase the costs of our home systems, appliances and repair parts.\n\ufeff\nCompetition\n\ufeff\nWe compete in the home service plan industry and the broader U.S. home services market. The home service plan industry is a highly competitive industry. The principal methods of competition, and by which we differentiate ourselves from our competitors, are quality and speed of service, contract offerings, brand awareness and reputation, customer satisfaction, pricing and promotions, contractor network and referrals.\n\ufeff\nAcquisition Activity\n\ufeff\nWe have a track record of sourcing and purchasing targets at attractive prices and successfully integrating them into our business, including the acquisitions of OneGuard and Landmark in 2016. We anticipate that the highly fragmented nature of the home service plan industry will continue to create opportunities for further consolidation. We use acquisitions to cost-effectively grow our home service plan contract count and deepen our customer base in high-growth geographies and may consider strategic acquisitions that will expand our reach into the home services market.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\ufeff\nTo supplement our results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have disclosed non-GAAP financial measures of operating results that exclude or adjust certain items. We present within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA. See Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d for a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information for its and investors' evaluation of our business performance and is useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of our business. While we believe this non-GAAP financial measure is useful in evaluating our business, it should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP financial measure may not be the same as similarly entitled measures reported by other companies.\n\ufeff\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Reform\n\ufeff\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. Tax Reform was signed into law. This legislation included numerous changes to existing tax law, including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, which has reduced our effective tax rate and cash tax payments, beginning in 2018. The rate reduction took effect on January 1, 2018; however, U.S. Tax Reform was signed in 2017 and had an immediate one-time effect of an income tax benefit of $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. See Note 5 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details.\n\ufeff\nKey Business Metrics\n\ufeff\nWe focus on a variety of indicators and key operating and financial metrics to monitor the financial condition, performance and cash flows of the continuing operations of our business. These metrics include:\n \u00b7 revenue, \n \u00b7 operating expenses, \n \u00b7 net income, \n \u00b7 earnings per share, \n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA, \n \u00b7 net cash provided from operating activities, \n \u00b7 Free Cash Flow, \n \u00b7 customer retention rate, and \n \u00b7 growth in number of home service plans. \n\ufeff\nRevenue. Home service plan contracts are typically one year in duration. We recognize revenue at the agreed upon contractual amount over time using the input method in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the contracts. Our revenue is primarily a function of the volume and pricing of the services provided to our customers, as well as the mix of services provided. Our revenue volume is impacted by new unit sales, customer retention and acquisitions. We derive all of our revenue from customers in the United States.\n\ufeff\nOperating Expenses. In addition to changes in our revenue, our operating results are affected by, among other things, the level of our operating expenses. Our operating expenses primarily include contract claims costs and expenses associated with sales and marketing, customer service and general corporate overhead. A number of our operating expenses are subject to inflationary pressures, such as: wages and salaries, employee benefits and health care; contractor costs; home systems, appliances and repair costs; tariffs; insurance premiums; and various regulatory compliance costs.\n\ufeff\nNet Income and Earnings Per Share. The presentation of net income and basic and diluted earnings per share provides measures of performance which are useful for investors, analysts and other interested parties in company-to-company operating performance comparisons. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, increased to include the number of shares of common stock that would have been outstanding had potentially dilutive shares of common stock been issued. The dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) are reflected in diluted net income per share by applying the treasury stock method.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA. We evaluate performance and allocate resources based primarily on Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before: provision for income taxes; interest expense; interest income from affiliate; depreciation and amortization expense; non-cash stock-based compensation expense; restructuring charges; Spin-off charges; affiliate royalty expense; (gain) loss on insured home service plan claims; and other non-operating expenses. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors, analysts and other interested parties as it facilitates company-to-company operating performance comparisons by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures, taxation, the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment, restructuring initiatives, Spin-off charges, arrangements with affiliates and equity-based, long-term incentive plans.\n\ufeff\nNet Cash Provided from Operating Activities and Free Cash Flow. We focus on measures designed to monitor cash flow, including net cash provided from operating activities and Free Cash Flow, which is a financial measure not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and represents net cash provided from operating activities less property additions.\n\ufeff\nCustomer Retention Rate and Growth in Number of Home Service Plans. We report our customer retention rate and growth in number of home service plans in order to track the performance of our business. Home service plans represent our recurring customer base, which includes customers with active contracts for recurring services. Our customer retention rate is calculated as the ratio of ending home service plans to the sum of beginning home service plans, new unit sales and acquired accounts for the applicable period. These measures are presented on a rolling, 12-month basis in order to avoid seasonal anomalies.\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\ufeff\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d is based upon our audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, contract claims costs, the impairment analysis for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, share-based compensation, income taxes, tax contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\ufeff\nWe believe the following accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most significant judgments and estimates.\n\ufeff\nRevenue Recognition\n\ufeff\nHome service plan contracts are typically one year in duration. We recognize revenue at the agreed upon contractual amount over time using the input method in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the contracts. Those costs bear a direct relationship to the fulfillment of our obligations under the contracts and are representative of the relative value provided to the customer (proportional performance method).\n\ufeff\nAt contract inception, we assess the goods and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a good or service (or a bundle of goods and services) that is distinct. To identify the performance obligation, we consider all of the goods and services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices.\n\ufeff\nHome Service Plan Claims Accruals\n\ufeff\nHome service plan claims costs are expensed as incurred. Accruals for home service plan claims are made based on our claims experience and actuarial projections. Accruals are established based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle claims. Home service plan claims take about three months to settle, on average, and substantially all claims are settled within six months of incurrence. The amount of time required to settle a claim can vary based on a number of factors, including whether a replacement is ultimately required. Our actuary performs an accrual analysis utilizing generally accepted actuarial methods that incorporate cumulative historical claims experience and information provided by us. We regularly review our estimates of claims costs and adjust the estimates when appropriate. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured. Nevertheless, changes in claims costs can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities.\n\ufeff\nCorporate Expense Allocation\n\ufeff\nOur audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include transactions with ServiceMaster for services (such as executive functions, information systems, accounting and finance, human resources, and legal and general corporate expenses) that were provided to us by the centralized ServiceMaster organization. Corporate level items also include personnel-related expenses of corporate employees (such as salaries, insurance coverage, stock-based compensation costs, etc.). Throughout the periods prior to the Spin-off covered by the financial statements, the costs of such functions, services and items have been directly charged or allocated to us using methods management believes are reasonable. The methods for allocating functions, services, and items to us are based on proportional allocation bases which include revenue, headcount and others. All such costs have been deemed to have been incurred and settled in the period where the costs were recorded.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes\n\ufeff\nFor purposes of our audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for periods prior to the Spin-off our taxes are provided for on a separate return\u201d basis, although our operations for the period prior to the completion of the Spin-off have historically been included in the tax returns filed by ServiceMaster. Income taxes as presented therein allocate current and deferred income taxes of the business to us in a manner that is systematic, rational, and consistent with the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740. Accordingly, as stated in paragraph 30 of ASC 740, the sum of the amounts allocated to the carve-out tax provisions may not equal the historical consolidated provision for us. Under the separate return method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates is accounted for in the period of enactment. The settlement of tax obligations is assumed in the period incurred and included in net parent investment for periods prior to the completion of the Spin-off.\n\ufeff\nOn October 1, 2018 Frontdoor and its subsidiaries began filing consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns. State and local returns are filed both on a separate company basis and on a combined unitary basis with Frontdoor. Current and deferred income taxes are provided for on a separate company basis. We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns.\n\ufeff\nWe record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns. We recognize potential interest and penalties related to its uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\n\ufeff\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n\ufeff\nIn accordance with applicable accounting standards, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are subject to assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value based test on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment. An assessment for impairment is performed on October 1 of every year. There were no goodwill or trade name impairment charges recorded during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016.\n\ufeff\nNewly Issued Accounting Standards\n\ufeff\nNew accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly impact our reported results and the comparability of our financial statements. See Note 2 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on newly issued accounting standards.\n\ufeff\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

Additionally, the impact of higher replacements, primarily appliances, in 2018 increased claims costs by $15 million. Results also include a net $3 million adjustment related to adverse development of prior year claims. Other includes an increase in bad debt expense of $2 million.\n\ufeff\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\n\ufeff\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we reported selling and administrative expenses of $338 million and $312 million, respectively, which comprised selling, marketing and customer service costs of $263 million and $245 million, respectively, and general and administrative expenses of $75 million and $67 million, respectively.

The increase in customer service costs was primarily driven by incremental investments in customer care centers to deliver an improved level of customer service. Incremental ongoing costs related to the Spin-off of $4 million were incurred, which primarily related to the separation of information technology systems historically shared with ServiceMaster. Other includes an increase in professional fees of $4 million.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation Expense\n\ufeff\nDepreciation expense was $12 million and $9 million in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was primarily due to additional property and equipment related to the headquarters relocation and information technology costs related to the separation, principally reflecting costs to replicate information technology systems historically shared with ServiceMaster.\n\ufeff\nAmortization Expense\n\ufeff\nAmortization expense was $8 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n\ufeff\nRestructuring Charges\n\ufeff\nWe incurred restructuring charges of $3 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\ufeff\nIn 2018, restructuring charges comprised $2 million of non-personnel charges primarily related to the relocation to our corporate headquarters and $1 million of severance costs, which primarily represent an allocation of severance costs related to actions taken to enhance capabilities and reduce costs in ServiceMaster's corporate functions that provided company-wide administrative services to support operations.\n\ufeff\nIn 2017, restructuring charges comprised $5 million of severance costs which primarily represent an allocation of severance costs and stock-based compensation expense as part of the severance agreement with ServiceMaster's former CEO and CFO, and allocations of $1 million of lease termination costs and $1 million of asset write-off and other costs related to the relocation to our corporate headquarters.\n\ufeff\nSpin-Off Charges\n\ufeff\nWe incurred Spin-off charges of $24 million and $13 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These charges include nonrecurring costs incurred to evaluate, plan and execute the Spin-off. In 2018, Spin-off charges primarily comprised $19 million of third-party consulting fees and $5 million of other incremental costs directly related to the Spin-off process. In 2017, Spin-off charges primarily comprised $12 million of third-party consulting fees and $1 million of other incremental costs directly related to the Spin-off process.\n\ufeff\nAffiliate Royalty Expense\n\ufeff\nAffiliate royalty expense represents royalty expense with ServiceMaster for the use of their trade names. We incurred royalty expense of $1 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease was due to the termination of the trademark license agreement with ServiceMaster in connection with the Spin-off. We will not incur these expenses in future periods.\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\nInterest expense was $23 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in interest expense was driven by our financing transactions totaling $1 billion that occurred in 2018 in connection with the Spin-off. See Note 13 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details.\n\ufeff\nInterest Income from Affiliate\n\ufeff\nInterest income from affiliate was $2 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and represents interest earned on interest-bearing related party notes receivable included within Net parent investment in the audited consolidated and combined statements of financial position included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These notes were settled concurrently with the consummation of the Spin-off.\n\ufeff\nInterest and Net Investment Income\n\ufeff\nInterest and net investment income was $2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and was composed of net investment gains and interest and dividend income realized on our investment portfolio.\n\ufeff\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nThe effective tax rate on income was 25.1 percent and 27.2 percent for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rates on income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were reduced primarily by the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. See Note 5 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details\n\ufeff\nOur audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not reflect any amounts due to ServiceMaster for income tax related matters as it is assumed that all such amounts due to ServiceMaster were settled at the end of each reporting period.\n\ufeff\nNet Income\n\ufeff\nOur net income was $125 million and $160 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $36 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2018 was driven by the aforementioned operating results, offset, in part, by an $18 million decrease in the provision for income taxes as a result of lower pre-tax income and U.S. Tax Reform.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\ufeff\nThe following table provides a summary of changes in our Adjusted EBITDA.

Additionally, the impact of higher replacements, primarily appliances, in 2018 increased claims costs by $15 million. Results also include a net $3 million adjustment related to adverse development of prior year claims.\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the increase in sales and marketing costs was driven by targeted spending to drive sales growth. The increase in customer service costs was primarily driven by incremental investments in customer care centers to deliver an improved level of customer service. Incremental ongoing costs related to the Spin-off of $4 million were incurred, which primarily related to the separation of information technology systems historically shared with ServiceMaster. Other primarily includes an increase in professional fees of $4 million and an increase in bad debt expense of $2 million.\n\ufeff\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and

We incurred incremental selling and administrative expenses as a result of the OneGuard and Landmark acquisitions. The increase in customer service costs was due to higher labor costs resulting from an acceleration of pre-season hiring and training in preparation for the high-volume summer season and an overall increase in call center staffing levels to improve response times.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation Expense\n\ufeff\nDepreciation expense was $9 million and $8 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased property and equipment that resulted from the acquisitions of OneGuard and Landmark in 2016.\n\ufeff\nAmortization Expense\n\ufeff\nAmortization expense was $8 million and $6 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to additional amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets that resulted from the acquisitions of OneGuard and Landmark in 2016.\n\ufeff\nRestructuring Charges\n\ufeff\nWe incurred restructuring charges of $7 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\ufeff\nIn 2017, restructuring charges comprised $5 million of severance costs which primarily represent an allocation of severance costs and stock-based compensation expense as part of the severance agreement with ServiceMaster's former CEO and CFO, and allocations of $1 million of lease termination costs and $1 million of asset write-off and other costs related to the relocation to our corporate headquarters.\n\ufeff\nIn 2016, restructuring charges comprised $1 million of severance and other costs related to an initiative to enhance capabilities and reduce costs in ServiceMaster's headquarters functions that provided administrative services for our operations, $1 million of lease termination and other costs related to the decision to consolidate the stand-alone operations of Home Security of America, Inc. ( HSA\u201d), acquired in February 2014, with those of the American Home Shield business and $1 million of charges related to the disposal of certain HSA property and equipment.\n\ufeff\nSpin-Off Charges\n\ufeff\nWe incurred Spin-off charges of $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges include nonrecurring costs incurred to evaluate, plan and execute the Spin-off and comprised $12 million of third-party consulting fees and $1 million of other incremental costs related to Spin-off process.\n\ufeff\nAffiliate Royalty Expense\n\ufeff\nAffiliate royalty expense represents royalty expense with ServiceMaster for the use of their trade names. We incurred royalty expense of $2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\nInterest expense was $1 million and less than $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and represents interest expense on seller financed debt that was used to fund a portion of the acquisitions of OneGuard and Landmark as well as the interest expense on capital lease obligations.\n\ufeff\nInterest Income from Affiliate\n\ufeff\nInterest income from affiliate was $3 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and represents interest earned on interest-bearing related party notes receivable included within Net parent investment in the audited consolidated and combined statements of financial position included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nInterest and Net Investment Income\n\ufeff\nInterest and net investment income was $2 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and was composed of net investment gains and interest and dividend income realized on our investment portfolio. The decrease in 2017 was primarily the result of sales of marketable securities that occurred in 2016.\n\ufeff\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nOur effective tax rate on income was 27.2 percent and 36.6 percent for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate on income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was favorably impacted by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the 2018 reduction to the federal tax rate. Additional information on income taxes, including our effective tax rate reconciliation and liabilities for uncertain tax positions, can be found in Note 5 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\ufeff\nOur financial statements for periods prior to the Spin-off do not reflect any amounts due to ServiceMaster for income tax related matters as it is assumed that all such amounts due to ServiceMaster were settled on December 31 of each year.\n\ufeff\nNet Income\n\ufeff\nOur net income was $160 million and $124 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $36 million increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven by the aforementioned operating results and an $11 million decrease in the provision for income taxes.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\ufeff\nThe following table provides a summary of changes in our Adjusted EBITDA.

The increase in sales and marketing costs was driven by increased sales commissions and incremental marketing spending to drive growth. We incurred incremental selling and administrative expenses as a result of the OneGuard and Landmark acquisitions. The increase in customer service costs was due to higher labor costs resulting from an acceleration of pre-season hiring and training in preparation for the high-volume summer season and an overall increase in call center staffing levels to improve response times. The decrease in interest and net investment income was primarily the result of sales of marketable securities that occurred in 2016.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\ufeff\nLiquidity\n\ufeff\nA substantial portion of our liquidity needs are due to debt service requirements on our indebtedness. The Credit Agreement, as well as the Indenture, contain covenants that limit or restrict our ability, including the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness, repurchase debt, incur liens, sell assets, make certain payments (including dividends) and enter into transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the covenants under the agreements that were in effect on such date.\n\ufeff\nHistorically, the primary source of liquidity for our business has been the cash flow provided by operations which was, prior to the Spin-off, transferred to ServiceMaster to support its overall cash management strategy. Prior to the Spin-off, transfers of cash to and from ServiceMaster have been reflected in Net Parent Investment in the historical combined statements of financial position and combined statements of cash flows. ServiceMaster's cash has not been assigned to us for any of the periods prior to the Spin-off presented in the audited consolidated and combined statements of financial position included in Part 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K because those cash balances are not directly attributable to us.\n\ufeff\nIn connection with the Spin-off, our capital structure and sources of liquidity have changed significantly from our historical capital structure. We no longer participate in cash management with ServiceMaster, but rather our ability to fund our cash needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate and raise cash in the future. Although we believe that our future cash provided from operations, together with available capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility and our access to capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund our operating and financing needs, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) our credit rating, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (iii) the current state of the economy. Moreover, to preserve the tax-free treatment of the Spin-off, we may not be able to engage in certain strategic or capital-raising transactions following the Spin-off, such as issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, which may limit our access to capital markets, ability to raise capital through equity issuances, and ability to make acquisitions using our equity as currency, potentially requiring us to issue more debt than would otherwise be optimal. There can be no assurances that we will continue to have access to capital markets on terms acceptable to us. See Risk Factors\u201d included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion.\n\ufeff\nCash and short- and long-term marketable securities totaled $305 million and $309 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, there were no letters of credit outstanding and there was $250 million of available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\ufeff\nIn connection with the Spin-off and effective as of October 1, 2018, the inter-company balance due to ServiceMaster of $144 million recorded in Due to Parent in the condensed combined statements of financial position at September 30, 2018 was settled in\ncash with ServiceMaster. Additionally, in connection with the Spin-off and effective as of October 1, 2018, ServiceMaster contributed $81 million of cash to us. The effect of these transactions was a net reduction of Cash and cash equivalents of $63 million.\n\ufeff\nCash and short- and long-term marketable securities include balances associated with regulatory requirements in our business. See -Limitations on Distributions and Dividends by Subsidiaries.\u201d Our investment portfolio has been invested in high-quality debt securities. We closely monitor the performance of these investments. From time to time, we review the statutory reserve requirements to which our regulated entities are subject and any changes to such requirements. These reviews may result in identifying current reserve levels above or below minimum statutory reserve requirements, in which case we may adjust our reserves. The reviews may also identify opportunities to satisfy certain regulatory reserve requirements through alternate financial vehicles.\n\ufeff\nWe may from time to time repurchase or otherwise retire or extend our debt and/or take other steps to reduce our debt or otherwise improve our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. These actions may include open market debt repurchases, negotiated repurchases, other retirements of outstanding debt and/or opportunistic refinancing of debt. The amount of debt that may be repurchased or otherwise retired or refinanced, if any, and the price of such repurchases, retirements or refinancings will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, our cash position, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations.\n\ufeff\nCredit Facilities and Senior Notes\n\ufeff\nOn August 16, 2018, in connection with the Spin-off, we entered into the $650 million Term Loan Facility and the $250 million Revolving Credit Facility and issued $350 million of 2026 Notes. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and the 2026 Notes were incurred as partial consideration for the contribution of the Separated Business to us. We did not receive any cash proceeds as a result of these transactions.\n\ufeff\nOn October 24, 2018, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective October 31, 2018 that expires on August 16, 2025. The notional amount of the agreement was $350 million. Under the terms of the agreement, we will pay a fixed rate of interest of 3.0865% on the $350 million notional amount, and we will receive a floating rate of interest (based on one-month LIBOR, subject to a floor of zero percent) on the notional amount. Therefore, during the term of the agreement, the effective interest rate on $350 million of the Term Loan Facility is fixed at a rate of 3.0865%, plus the incremental borrowing margin of 2.50%.\n\ufeff\nLimitations on Distributions and Dividends by Subsidiaries\n\ufeff\nWe depend on our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us so that we may pay obligations and expenses, including satisfying obligations with respect to indebtedness. The ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions and dividends to us depends on their operating results, cash requirements, financial condition and general business conditions, as well as restrictions under the laws of our subsidiaries' jurisdictions.\n\ufeff\nOur subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of the Credit Agreement and other indebtedness to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict or prohibit the making of distributions, the payment of dividends or the making of loans by such subsidiaries to us.\n\ufeff\nFurthermore, there are third-party restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. These restrictions are related to regulatory requirements. The payments of ordinary and extraordinary dividends by certain of our subsidiaries (through which we conduct our business) are subject to significant regulatory restrictions under the laws and regulations of the states in which they operate. Among other things, such laws and regulations require certain subsidiaries to maintain minimum capital and net worth requirements and may limit the amount of ordinary and extraordinary dividends and other payments that these subsidiaries can pay to us. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total net assets subject to these third-party restrictions was $187 million and $169 million, respectively. We expect that such limitations will be in effect for the foreseeable future. In Texas, we are relieved of the obligation to post 75 percent of our otherwise required reserves because we operate a captive insurer approved by Texas regulators in order to satisfy such obligations. None of our subsidiaries are obligated to make funds available to us through the payment of dividends.\n\ufeff\nCash Flows\n\ufeff\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, as reflected in the audited consolidated and combined statements of cash flows included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are summarized in the following table.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided from (used for):\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>189 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>194 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>155 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(10) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(11) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(55) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(165) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(68) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(88) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash increase during the period\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>14 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>114 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>12 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nOperating Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided from operating activities was $189 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,"}
