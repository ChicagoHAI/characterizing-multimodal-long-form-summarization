Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company makes statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information.\u201d Certain risk factors may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nThe Company is organized in an UpREIT format pursuant to which Retail Opportunity Investments GP, LLC, its wholly-owned subsidiary, serves as the general partner of, and ROIC conducts substantially all of its business through, its Operating Partnership, Retail Opportunity Investments Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, together with its subsidiaries.\nROIC commenced operations in October 2009 as a fully integrated and self-managed REIT, and as of December 31, 2016, ROIC owned an approximate 90.3% partnership interest and other limited partners owned the remaining 9.7% partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. ROIC specializes in the acquisition, ownership and management of necessity-based community and neighborhood shopping centers on the west coast of the United States, anchored by supermarkets and drugstores.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company's portfolio consisted of 82 properties (81 retail and one office) totaling approximately 9.4 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's portfolio was approximately 97.6% leased. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company leased and renewed approximately 585,000 and 763,000 square feet, respectively, in its portfolio.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of beginning of year vacant space to end of year vacant space as of December 31, 2016.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Vacant Space Square Footage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vacant space at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>238,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Square footage vacated\n</td> <td>281,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vacant space in acquired properties\n</td> <td>20,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Square footage leased\n</td> <td>(302,259\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vacant space at December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>237,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has committed approximately $33.8 million, or $58.90 per square foot, in tenant improvements, including building and site improvements, for new leases that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company has committed approximately $2.0 million, or $3.46 per square foot, in leasing commissions for the new leases that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, the Company has committed approximately $737,000, or $0.97 per square foot, in tenant improvements for renewed leases that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016. Leasing commission commitments for renewed leases were not material for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResults of Operations\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had 82 properties (81 retail and one office), all of which are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements. The Company believes, because of the location of the properties in densely populated areas, the nature of its investments provides for relatively stable revenue flows even during difficult economic times. The Company has a strong capital structure with manageable debt as of December 31, 2016. The Company expects to continue to actively explore acquisition opportunities consistent with its business strategy.\nProperty operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. The Company defines property operating income as operating revenues (base rent, recoveries from tenants and other income), less property and related expenses (property operating expenses and property taxes). Property operating income excludes general and administrative expenses, mortgage interest income, depreciation and amortization, acquisition transaction costs, other expense, interest expense, gains and losses from property acquisitions and dispositions, equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures, extraordinary items, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating property operating income, and accordingly, the Company's property operating income may not be comparable to other REITs.\nProperty operating income is used by management to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the Company's properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of the Company's properties as this measure is not affected by the cost of our funding, the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses from the acquisition and sale of operating real estate assets, general and administrative expenses or other gains and losses that relate to our ownership of our properties. The Company believes the exclusion of these items from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the Company's properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nProperty operating income is a measure of the operating performance of the Company's properties but does not measure the Company's performance as a whole. Property operating income is therefore not a substitute for net income or operating income as computed in accordance with GAAP.\nResults of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nProperty Operating Income\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of consolidated operating income in accordance with GAAP to consolidated property operating income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands).\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income per GAAP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus:\n</td> <td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>88,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>13,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition transaction costs\n</td> <td>824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>627\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following comparison for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, makes reference to the effect of the same-center properties.

Property operating income increased by $35.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in the number of properties owned by the Company in 2016 compared to 2015 and an increase in same-center properties' operating income. As of December 31, 2016, the Company owned 82 properties as compared to 73 properties at December 31, 2015. The properties acquired during 2016 and 2015 increased property operating income in 2016 by approximately $30.7 million. The 61 same-center properties increased property operating income by approximately $4.7 million. This increase is primarily due to an increase in base rents.\nDepreciation and amortization\nThe Company incurred depreciation and amortization expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $88.4 million compared to $71.0 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in 2016 as a result of an increase in the number of properties owned by the Company in 2016 compared to 2015.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nThe Company incurred general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $13.1 million compared to $12.7 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $470,000 primarily as a result of an increase in compensation-related expenses.\nAcquisition transaction costs\nThe Company incurred property acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $824,000, which is consistent with the $965,000 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest expense and other finance expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred approximately $40.7 million of interest expense compared to approximately $34.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense increased approximately $6.5 million primarily due to a higher debt level as a result of acquisitions and interest incurred related to the Senior Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016.\nResults of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nProperty Operating Income\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of consolidated operating income in accordance with GAAP to consolidated property operating income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands).\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income per GAAP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus:\n</td> <td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>70,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>12,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition transaction costs\n</td> <td>965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>961\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following comparison for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, makes reference to the effect of the same-center properties.

Property operating income increased by $29.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in the number of properties owned by the Company in 2015 compared to 2014 and an increase in same-center properties' operating income. As of December 31, 2015, the Company owned 73 properties as compared to 61 properties at December 31, 2014. The properties acquired during 2015 and 2014 increased property operating income in 2015 by approximately $23.8 million. The 53 same-center properties increased property operating income by approximately $5.8 million. This increase is primarily due to an increase in base rents and other property income.\nDepreciation and amortization\nThe Company incurred depreciation and amortization expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 of approximately $71.0 million compared to $58.4 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in 2015 as a result of an increase in the number of properties owned by the Company in 2015 compared to 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nThe Company incurred general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 of approximately $12.7 million compared to $11.2 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $1.5 million primarily as a result of an increase in compensation-related expenses.\nAcquisition transaction costs\nThe Company incurred property acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2015 of approximately $965,000, which is consistent with the $961,000 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense and other finance expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred approximately $34.2 million of interest expense compared to approximately $27.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest expense increased approximately $6.7 million primarily due to a higher debt level as a result of acquisitions, interest incurred related to the Senior Notes Due 2024 issued in December 2014, slightly offset by a decrease in interest related to the Company's interest rate swaps, as the Company's prior swaps were cash settled in 2014.\nGain on sale of property\nOn June 5, 2014, the Company sold Phillips Village Shopping Center, a non-core shopping center located in Pomona, California with an occupancy rate of approximately 10.4% as of May 31, 2014. The sales price of this property of approximately $16.0 million, less costs to sell, resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $15.6 million. The Company recorded a gain on sale of approximately $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, on August 25, 2014, the Company sold the Oregon City Point Shopping Center, a non-core shopping center located in Oregon City, Oregon. The sales price of this property of approximately $12.4 million, less costs to sell, resulted in net proceeds of approximately $12.0 million. The Company recorded a gain on sale of approximately $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. There were no comparable gains recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFunds From Operations\nFunds from operations ( FFO\u201d), is a widely-recognized non-GAAP financial measure for REITs that the Company believes when considered with financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, provides additional and useful means to assess its financial performance. FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate the performance of REITs, most of which present FFO along with net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company computes FFO in accordance with the White Paper\u201d on FFO published by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), which defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring, sales of depreciable property, and impairments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for partnerships and unconsolidated joint ventures.\nHowever, FFO:\n\u2022does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP (which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income); and\n\u2022should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance.\nFFO as defined by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled items reported by other REITs due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) guidance relating to accounting for acquisitions that meet the definition of a business requires, among other things, an acquirer of a business to expense all acquisition costs related to the acquisition. Effective October 1, 2016, the Company prospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-1, Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business\u201d issued by the FASB which redefined the definition of a business, whereby an acquisition in which substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset is accounted for as an asset acquisition. As a result, transaction costs related to the acquisition are capitalized. See Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, during the three months ended December 31, 2016, the Company concluded that its acquisitions did not meet the definition of a business and accounted for such acquisitions as asset acquisitions and capitalized all transaction costs related to completed and in-process acquisitions. Acquisition costs that are expensed will reduce our FFO. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company expensed $824,000, $1.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, relating to real estate acquisitions.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of net income applicable to stockholders in accordance with GAAP to FFO for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands).\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to ROIC\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>88,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of real estate\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,869\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations - basic\n</td> <td>121,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>3,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>749\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations - diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Net Operating Income ( NOI\u201d)\nCash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of the Company's performance. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is operating income. The Company defines cash NOI as operating revenues (base rent and recoveries from tenants), less property and related expenses (property operating expenses and property taxes), adjusted for non-cash revenue and operating expense items such as straight-line rent and amortization of lease intangibles, debt-related expenses, and other adjustments. Cash NOI also excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, acquisition transaction costs, other expense, interest expense, gains and losses from property acquisitions and dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating cash NOI, and accordingly, the Company's cash NOI may not be comparable to other REITs.\nCash NOI is used by management internally to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the Company's properties. The Company believes cash NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those cash income and expense items that are incurred at the property level, and when compared across periods, can be used to determine trends in earnings of the Company's properties as this measure is not affected by non-cash revenue and expense recognition items, the cost of the Company's funding, the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses from the acquisition and sale of operating real estate assets, general and administrative expenses or other gains and losses that relate to the Company's ownership of properties. The Company believes the exclusion of these items from operating income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the Company's properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nCash NOI is a measure of the operating performance of the Company's properties but does not measure the Company's performance as a whole and is therefore not a substitute for net income or operating income as computed in accordance with GAAP.\nSame-Center Cash NOI\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of same-center cash NOI to consolidated operating income in accordance with GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The table makes reference to the effect of the same-center properties. Same-center properties, which totaled 61 of the Company's 82 properties as of December 31, 2016, represent all operating properties owned by the Company during the entirety of both periods presented and consolidated into the Company's financial statements during such periods (in thousands).\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same-center cash NOI\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non same-center cash NOI\n</td> <td>35,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Company cash NOI\n</td> <td>161,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>(88,359\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70,957\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>(13,120\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,650\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition transaction costs\n</td> <td>(824\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(965\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>(456\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(627\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property revenues and expenses (1)\n</td> <td>18,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes straight-line rents, amortization of above-market and below-market lease intangibles, anchor lease termination fees, net of contractual amounts, and expense and recovery adjustments related to prior periods.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company generated same-center cash NOI of approximately $125.7 million compared to same-center cash NOI of approximately $119.3 million generated during the year ended December 31, 2015, representing a 5.3% increase. This increase is primarily due to an increase in base rents and recoveries, slightly offset by a decrease in other property income.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of same-center cash NOI to consolidated operating income in accordance with GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

This increase is primarily due to an increase in base rents and other property income, and a decrease in bad debt expense.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those that are both important to the presentation of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting estimates that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. This summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the Company's accounting policies included in Note 1 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records base rents on a straight-line basis over the term of each lease. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in tenant and other receivables on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Most leases contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro-rata share of real estate taxes and certain common area expenses. Adjustments are also made throughout the year to tenant and other receivables and the related cost recovery income based upon the Company's best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected. In addition, the Company also provides an allowance for future credit losses in connection with the deferred straight-line rent receivable.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on a quarterly analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts. The analysis places particular emphasis on past-due accounts and considers information such as the nature and age of the receivables, the payment history of the tenants or other debtors, the financial condition of the tenants and any guarantors and management's assessment of their ability to meet their lease obligations, the basis for any disputes and the status of related negotiations, among other things. Management's estimates of the required allowance is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on tenants, particularly those at retail properties. Estimates are used to establish reimbursements from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate tax and insurance costs. The Company analyzes the balance of its estimated accounts receivable for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance for each of its properties by comparing actual recoveries versus actual expenses and any actual write-offs. Based on its analysis, the Company may record an additional amount in its allowance for doubtful accounts related to these items. In addition, the Company also provides an allowance for future credit losses in connection with the deferred straight-line rent receivable.\nReal Estate Investments\nLand, buildings, property improvements, furniture/fixtures and tenant improvements are recorded at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Renovations and/or replacements, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\nThe Company recognizes the acquisition of real estate properties, including acquired tangible (consisting of land, buildings and improvements), and acquired intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above-market and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases) at their fair value (for acquisitions meeting the definition of a business) and relative fair value (for acquisitions not meeting the definition of a business). Acquired lease intangible assets include above-market leases and acquired in-place leases, and acquired lease intangible liabilities represent below-market leases, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, which value is then allocated to land, buildings and improvements based on management's determination of the relative fair values of these assets. In valuing an acquired property's intangibles, factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods based on its evaluation of current market demand. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases, including leasing commissions, tenant improvements, legal and other related costs.\nThe value of in-place leases is measured by the excess of (i) the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in-place leases to market rental rates, over (ii) the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant. Above-market and below-market lease values are recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be received and management's estimate of market lease rates, measured over the terms of the respective leases that management deemed appropriate at the time of acquisition. Such valuations include a consideration of the non-cancellable terms of the respective leases as well as any applicable renewal periods. The fair values\nassociated with below-market rental renewal options are determined based on the Company's experience and the relevant facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the acquisitions. The value of the above-market and below-market leases associated with the original lease term is amortized to rental income, over the terms of the respective leases. The value of in-place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancellable terms of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be recognized in operations at that time.\nThe Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful life of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation. These assessments have a direct impact on its net income.\nProperties are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Buildings\n</td> <td>39-40 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property Improvements\n</td> <td>10-20 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Furniture/Fixtures\n</td> <td>3-10 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant Improvements\n</td> <td>Shorter of lease term or their useful life\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsset Impairment\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to aggregate future net cash flows (undiscounted and without interest) expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value.\nREIT Qualification Requirements\nThe Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, and believes that it has been organized and has operated in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code.\nThe Company is subject to a number of operational and organizational requirements to qualify and then maintain qualification as a REIT. If the Company does not qualify as a REIT, its income would become subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates that would be substantial and the Company may not be permitted to re-elect to qualify as a REIT for four taxable years following the year that it failed to qualify as a REIT. The Company's results of operations, liquidity and amounts distributable to stockholders would be significantly reduced.\nRecent U.S. Federal Income Tax Legislation\nOn December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, an omnibus spending bill, with a division referred to as the Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the PATH Act\u201d). The PATH Act changes certain of the rules affecting REIT qualification and taxation of REITs and REIT shareholders, which are briefly summarized below.\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For taxable years beginning after 2017, the percentage of a REIT's total assets that may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs is reduced from 25% to 20%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td> Publicly offered REITs\u201d (which generally include any REIT required to file annual and periodic reports with the SEC, including us) are no longer subject to the preferential dividend rules for taxable years beginning after 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For taxable years beginning after 2015, debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs are qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% REIT asset test.

Because the Company operates on a consolidated basis with the Operating Partnership, the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership\u201d should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the Company on a consolidated basis and how the Company is operated as a whole.\nThe Company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company. The Company itself does not hold any indebtedness other than guarantees of indebtedness of the Operating Partnership, and its only material assets are its ownership of direct or indirect partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and membership interest in Retail Opportunity Investments GP, LLC, the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the consolidated assets and liabilities and the consolidated revenues and expenses of the Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. However, all debt is held directly or indirectly by the Operating Partnership. The Company's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common stock. The Company's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership.\nAs the parent company of the Operating Partnership, the Company, indirectly, has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management and control. The Company causes the Operating Partnership to distribute\nsuch portion of its available cash as the Company may in its discretion determine, in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement.\nThe Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with an effective shelf registration statement filed in May 2016 that allows the Company to register unspecified various classes of debt and equity securities. As circumstances warrant, the Company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. Any proceeds from such equity issuances would be contributed to the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to acquire additional properties, pay down debt, and for general working capital purposes.\nLiquidity is a measure of the Company's ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain its assets and operations, make distributions to its stockholders and meet other general business needs. The liquidity of the Company is dependent on the Operating Partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to the Company. The primary cash requirement of the Company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's primary sources of cash were distributions from the Operating Partnership and proceeds from the issuance of common stock. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has determined that it has adequate working capital to meet its dividend funding obligations for the next twelve months.\nOn July 12, 2016, ROIC issued 6,555,000 shares of common stock in a registered public offering, including shares issued upon the exercise in full of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $133.0 million, after deducting the underwriters' discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, ROIC entered into four separate Sales Agreements (the Original Sales Agreements\u201d) with each of Jefferies LLC, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., MLV & Co. LLC and Raymond James & Associates, Inc. (each individually, an Original Agent\u201d and collectively, the Original Agents\u201d) pursuant to which ROIC may sell, from time to time, shares of ROIC's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million through the Original Agents either as agents or principals. On May 23, 2016, ROIC entered into two additional sales agreements (the Additional Sales Agreements\u201d, and together with the Original Sales Agreements, the Sales Agreements\u201d) with each of Canaccord Genuity Inc. and Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated (the Additional Agents\u201d, and together with the Original Agents, the Agents\u201d) pursuant to which the Company may sell shares of ROIC's common stock through the Additional Agents either as agents or principals. In addition, on May 19, 2016, the Company terminated the Original Sales Agreement with MLV & Co. LLC. During the year ended December 31, 2016, ROIC sold a total of 2,202,254 shares of common stock under the Sales Agreements, which resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $45.6 million and commissions of approximately $584,000 paid to the Agents.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, dividends paid to stockholders totaled approximately $75.7 million. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the Operating Partnership made distributions of approximately $8.4 million to the non-controlling interest OP Unitholders. On a consolidated basis, cash flows from operations for the same period totaled approximately $114.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, dividends paid to stockholders totaled approximately $65.8 million. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Operating Partnership made distributions of approximately $2.8 million to the non-controlling interest OP Unitholders. On a consolidated basis, cash flows from operations for the same period totaled approximately $86.9 million.\nPotential future sources of capital include equity issuances and distributions from the Operating Partnership.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership\nIn this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership\u201d section, the terms the Operating Partnership,\u201d we\u201d, our\u201d and us\u201d refer to the Operating Partnership together with its consolidated subsidiaries or the Operating Partnership and the Company together with their respective consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Operating Partnership's primary sources of cash were (i) proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured debt, (ii) cash flow from operations, (iii) proceeds from bank borrowings under the credit facility, and (iv) cash contributed by ROIC from the issuance of common stock. As of December 31, 2016, the Operating Partnership has determined that it has adequate working capital to meet its debt obligations and operating expenses for the next twelve months.\nOn September 29, 2015, the Company entered into a term loan agreement with KeyBank National Association, as Administrative Agent, and U.S. Bank National Association, as Syndication Agent and the other lenders party thereto, under which the lenders agreed to provide a $300.0 million unsecured term loan facility. The term loan agreement also provides that the Company may from time to time request increased aggregate commitments of $200.0 million under certain conditions set forth in the term loan\nagreement, including the consent of the lenders for the additional commitments. The initial maturity date of the term loan is January 31, 2019, subject to two one-year extension options, which may be exercised upon satisfaction of certain conditions including the payment of extension fees. Borrowings under the term loan agreement bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to an applicable rate based on the credit rating level of the Company, plus, as applicable, (i) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the relevant period (the Eurodollar Rate\u201d), or (ii) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the rate of interest announced by the Administrative Agent as its \"prime rate,\" and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.10%.\nThe Operating Partnership has an unsecured revolving credit facility with several banks which provides for borrowings of up to $500.0 million. Additionally, the credit facility contains an accordion feature, which allows the Operating Partnership to increase the facility amount up to an aggregate of $1.0 billion, subject to lender consents and other conditions. The maturity date of the credit facility is January 31, 2019, subject to a further one-year extension option, which may be exercised by the Operating Partnership upon satisfaction of certain conditions. The Company has investment grade credit ratings from Moody's Investors Service (Baa2) and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (BBB-). Borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to an applicable rate based on the credit rating level of the Company, plus, as applicable, (i) the Eurodollar Rate, or (ii) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the rate of interest announced by KeyBank, National Association at its prime rate,\u201d and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%. Additionally, the Operating Partnership is obligated to pay a facility fee at a rate based on the credit rating level of the Company, currently 0.20%, and a fronting fee at a rate of 0.125% per year with respect to each letter of credit issued under the credit facility.\nBoth the term loan and credit facility contain customary representations, financial and other covenants. The Operating Partnership's ability to borrow under the credit facility and term loan is subject to its compliance with financial covenants and other restrictions on an ongoing basis. The Operating Partnership was in compliance with such covenants at December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, $300.0 million and $98.0 million were outstanding under the term loan and credit facility, respectively. The average interest rates on the term loan and the credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2016 were 1.6% and 1.5%, respectively. The Company had no available borrowings under the term loan at December 31, 2016. The Company had $402.0 million available to borrow under the credit facility at December 31, 2016.\nOn July 26, 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, as amended, which provided for the issuance of $200.0 million principal amount of 3.95% Senior Notes Due 2026 in a private placement. The Senior Notes Due 2026 pay interest on March 22 and September 22 of each year, commencing on March 22, 2017, and mature on September 22, 2026, unless prepaid earlier by the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership's performance of the obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement, including the payment of any outstanding indebtedness thereunder, are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by ROIC.\nFurther, the Operating Partnership issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in December 2014 and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in December 2013, each of which were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ROIC.\nWhile the Operating Partnership generally intends to hold its assets as long term investments, certain of its investments may be sold in order to manage the Operating Partnership's interest rate risk and liquidity needs, meet other operating objectives and adapt to market conditions. The timing and impact of future sales of its investments, if any, cannot be predicted with any certainty.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Provided by (Used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(325,090\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(337,115\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(399,856\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>214,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Flows from:\nOperating Activities\nIncrease in cash flows provided by operating activities from 2015 to 2016:\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $114.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $86.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.

As of December 31, 2016, the Company did not have any capital lease obligations.\nThe Company has entered into several lease agreements with an officer of the Company. Pursuant to the lease agreements, the Company is provided the use of storage space.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nReal Estate Taxes\nThe Company's leases generally require the tenants to be responsible for a pro rata portion of the real estate taxes.\nInflation\nThe Company's long-term leases contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on its operating results. Such provisions include clauses entitling the Company to receive (a) scheduled base rent increases and (b) percentage rents based upon tenants' gross sales which generally increase as prices rise. In addition, many of the Company's non-anchor leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits the Company to seek increases in rents upon renewal at then-current market rates if rents provided in the expiring leases are below then-existing market rates. Most of the Company's leases require tenants to pay a share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, thereby reducing the Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.\nLeverage Policies\nThe Company employs prudent amounts of leverage and uses debt as a means of providing additional funds for the acquisition of its properties and the diversification of its portfolio. The Company seeks to primarily utilize unsecured debt in order to maintain liquidity and flexibility in its capital structure.\nOn September 29, 2015, the Company entered into the Term Loan Agreement with KeyBank National Association, as Administrative Agent, and U.S. Bank National Association, as Syndication Agent and the other lenders party thereto, under which the lenders agreed to provide a $300.0 million unsecured term loan facility. The Term Loan Agreement also provides that the Company may from time to time request increased aggregate commitments of $200.0 million under certain conditions set forth in the Term Loan Agreement, including the consent of the lenders for the additional commitments. The initial maturity date of the term loan is January 31, 2019, subject to two one-year extension options, which may be exercised upon satisfaction of certain conditions including the payment of extension fees. The Operating Partnership has an unsecured revolving credit facility with several banks which provides for borrowings of up to $500.0 million. Additionally, the credit facility contains an accordion feature, which allows the Operating Partnership to increase the facility amount up to an aggregate of $1.0 billion, subject to lender consents and other conditions. The maturity date of the credit facility is January 31, 2019, subject to a further one-year extension option, which may be exercised by the Operating Partnership upon satisfaction of certain conditions.\nOn July 26, 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, as amended, which provided for the issuance of $200.0 million principal amount of 3.95% Senior Notes Due 2026 in a private placement. The Senior Notes Due 2026 pay interest on March 22 and September 22 of each year, commencing on March 22, 2017, and mature on September 22, 2026, unless prepaid earlier by the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership's performance of the obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement, including the payment of any outstanding indebtedness thereunder, are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by ROIC.\nIn addition, the Operating Partnership issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in December 2014 and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in December 2013, each of which were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ROIC.\nThe Company may borrow on a non-recourse basis at the corporate level or Operating Partnership level. Non-recourse indebtedness means the indebtedness of the borrower or its subsidiaries is secured only by specific assets without recourse to other assets of the borrower or any of its subsidiaries. Even with non-recourse indebtedness, however, a borrower or its subsidiaries will likely be required to guarantee against certain breaches of representations and warranties such as those relating to the absence of fraud, misappropriation, misapplication of funds, environmental conditions and material misrepresentations. Because non-recourse financing generally restricts the lender's claim on the assets of the borrower, the lender generally may only proceed against the asset securing the debt. This may protect the Company's other assets.\nThe Company plans to evaluate each investment opportunity and determine the appropriate leverage on a case-by-case basis and also on a Company-wide basis. The Company may seek to refinance indebtedness, such as when a decline in interest rates makes it beneficial to prepay an existing mortgage, when an existing mortgage matures or if an attractive investment becomes available and the proceeds from the refinancing can be used to purchase the investment.\nThe Company plans to finance future acquisitions through a combination of cash, borrowings under its credit facility, the assumption of existing mortgage debt, the issuance of OP Units, and equity and debt offerings. In addition, the Company may acquire retail properties indirectly through joint ventures with third parties as a means of increasing the funds available for the acquisition of properties.\nDistributions\nThe Operating Partnership and ROIC intend to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of their OP Units and common stock, respectively. The Operating Partnership pays distributions to ROIC directly as a holder of units of the Operating Partnership, and indirectly to ROIC through distributions to Retail Opportunity Investments GP, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of ROIC. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its net taxable income. ROIC intends to pay regular quarterly dividends to its stockholders in an amount not less than its net taxable income, if and to the extent authorized by its board of directors. If ROIC's cash available for distribution is less than its net taxable income, ROIC could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or the Company may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I'm unable to understand the provided text properly.\n- It seems to

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company makes statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information.\u201d Certain risk factors may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nThe Company is organized in an UpREIT format pursuant to which Retail Opportunity Investments GP, LLC, its wholly-owned subsidiary, serves as the general partner of, and ROIC conducts substantially all of its business through, its Operating Partnership, Retail Opportunity Investments Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, together with its subsidiaries.\nROIC commenced operations in October 2009 as a fully integrated and self-managed REIT, and as of December 31, 2016, ROIC owned an approximate 90.3% partnership interest and other limited partners owned the remaining 9.7% partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. ROIC specializes in the acquisition, ownership and management of necessity-based community and neighborhood shopping centers on the west coast of the United States, anchored by supermarkets and drugstores.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company's portfolio consisted of 82 properties (81 retail and one office) totaling approximately 9.4 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's portfolio was approximately 97.6% leased. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company leased and renewed approximately 585,000 and 763,000 square feet, respectively, in its portfolio.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of beginning of year vacant space to end of year vacant space as of December 31, 2016.\n\nThe Company has committed approximately $33.8 million, or $58.90 per square foot, in tenant improvements, including building and site improvements, for new leases that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company has committed approximately $2.0 million, or $3.46 per square foot, in leasing commissions for the new leases that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, the Company has committed approximately $737,000, or $0.97 per square foot, in tenant improvements for renewed leases that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016. Leasing commission commitments for renewed leases were not material for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResults of Operations\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had 82 properties (81 retail and one office), all of which are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements. The Company believes, because of the location of the properties in densely populated areas, the nature of its investments provides for relatively stable revenue flows even during difficult economic times. The Company has a strong capital structure with manageable debt as of December 31, 2016. The Company expects to continue to actively explore acquisition opportunities consistent with its business strategy.\nProperty operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. The Company defines property operating income as operating revenues (base rent, recoveries from tenants and other income), less property and related expenses (property operating expenses and property taxes). Property operating income excludes general and administrative expenses, mortgage interest income, depreciation and amortization, acquisition transaction costs, other expense, interest expense, gains and losses from property acquisitions and dispositions, equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures, extraordinary items, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating property operating income, and accordingly, the Company's property operating income may not be comparable to other REITs.\nProperty operating income is used by management to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the Company's properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of the Company's properties as this measure is not affected by the cost of our funding, the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses from the acquisition and sale of operating real estate assets, general and administrative expenses or other gains and losses that relate to our ownership of our properties. The Company believes the exclusion of these items from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the Company's properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nProperty operating income is a measure of the operating performance of the Company's properties but does not measure the Company's performance as a whole. Property operating income is therefore not a substitute for net income or operating income as computed in accordance with GAAP.\nResults of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nProperty Operating Income\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of consolidated operating income in accordance with GAAP to consolidated property operating income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands).\n\nThe following comparison for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, makes reference to the effect of the same-center properties. Same-center properties, which totaled 61 of the Company's 82 properties as of December 31, 2016, represent all operating properties owned by the Company during the entirety of both periods presented and consolidated into the Company's financial statements during such periods.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of consolidated operating income in accordance with GAAP to property operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the 61 same-center properties owned by the Company during the entirety of both the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and consolidated into the Company's financial statements during such periods (in thousands).\n\n______________________\n (1) For illustration purposes, general and administrative expenses and other expenses are included in non same-center because the Company does not allocate these types of expenses between same-center and non same-center properties. \nThe table below provides a reconciliation of consolidated operating income in accordance with GAAP to property operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the 61 same-center properties owned by the Company during the entirety of both the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and consolidated into the Company's financial statements during such periods (in thousands).\n\n______________________\n (1) For illustration purposes, general and administrative expenses and other expenses are included in non same-center because the Company does not allocate these types of expenses between same-center and non same-center properties. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company generated property operating income of approximately $179.9 million compared to property operating income of $144.5 million generated during the year ended December 31, 2015. Property operating income increased by $35.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in the number of properties owned by the Company in 2016 compared to 2015 and an increase in same-center properties' operating income. As of December 31, 2016, the Company owned 82 properties as compared to 73 properties at December 31, 2015. The properties acquired during 2016 and 2015 increased property operating income in 2016 by approximately $30.7 million. The 61 same-center properties increased property operating income by approximately $4.7 million. This increase is primarily due to an increase in base rents.\nDepreciation and amortization\nThe Company incurred depreciation and amortization expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $88.4 million compared to $71.0 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in 2016 as a result of an increase in the number of properties owned by the Company in 2016 compared to 2015.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nThe Company incurred general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $13.1 million compared to $12.7 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $470,000 primarily as a result of an increase in compensation-related expenses.\nAcquisition transaction costs\nThe Company incurred property acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $824,000, which is consistent with the $965,000 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest expense and other finance expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred approximately $40.7 million of interest expense compared to approximately $34.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense increased approximately $6.5 million primarily due to a higher debt level as a result of acquisitions and interest incurred related to the Senior Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016.\nResults of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nProperty Operating Income\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of consolidated operating income in accordance with GAAP to consolidated property operating income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands).\n\nThe following comparison for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, makes reference to the effect of the same-center properties. Same-center properties, which totaled 53 of the Company's 73 properties as of December 31, 2015, represent all operating properties owned by the Company during the entirety of both periods presented and consolidated into the Company's financial statements during such periods.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of consolidated operating income in accordance with GAAP to property operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the 53 same-center properties owned by the Company during the entirety of both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and consolidated into the Company's financial statements during such periods (in thousands).\n\n______________________\n (1) For illustration purposes, general and administrative expenses and other expenses are included in non same-center because the Company does not allocate these types of expenses between same-center and non same-center properties. \nThe table below provides a reconciliation of consolidated operating income in accordance with GAAP to property operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to the 53 same-center properties owned by the Company during the entirety of both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and consolidated into the Company's financial statements during such periods (in thousands).\n\n______________________\n (1) For illustration purposes, general and administrative expenses and other expenses are included in non same-center because the Company does not allocate these types of expenses between same-center and non same-center properties. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company generated property operating income of approximately $144.5 million compared to property operating income of $114.9 million generated during the year ended December 31, 2014. Property operating income increased by $29.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in the number of properties owned by the Company in 2015 compared to 2014 and an increase in same-center properties' operating income. As of December 31, 2015, the Company owned 73 properties as compared to 61 properties at December 31, 2014. The properties acquired during 2015 and 2014 increased property operating income in 2015 by approximately $23.8 million. The 53 same-center properties increased property operating income by approximately $5.8 million. This increase is primarily due to an increase in base rents and other property income.\nDepreciation and amortization\nThe Company incurred depreciation and amortization expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 of approximately $71.0 million compared to $58.4 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in 2015 as a result of an increase in the number of properties owned by the Company in 2015 compared to 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nThe Company incurred general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 of approximately $12.7 million compared to $11.2 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $1.5 million primarily as a result of an increase in compensation-related expenses.\nAcquisition transaction costs\nThe Company incurred property acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2015 of approximately $965,000, which is consistent with the $961,000 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense and other finance expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred approximately $34.2 million of interest expense compared to approximately $27.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest expense increased approximately $6.7 million primarily due to a higher debt level as a result of acquisitions, interest incurred related to the Senior Notes Due 2024 issued in December 2014, slightly offset by a decrease in interest related to the Company's interest rate swaps, as the Company's prior swaps were cash settled in 2014.\nGain on sale of property\nOn June 5, 2014, the Company sold Phillips Village Shopping Center, a non-core shopping center located in Pomona, California with an occupancy rate of approximately 10.4% as of May 31, 2014. The sales price of this property of approximately $16.0 million, less costs to sell, resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $15.6 million. The Company recorded a gain on sale of approximately $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, on August 25, 2014, the Company sold the Oregon City Point Shopping Center, a non-core shopping center located in Oregon City, Oregon. The sales price of this property of approximately $12.4 million, less costs to sell, resulted in net proceeds of approximately $12.0 million. The Company recorded a gain on sale of approximately $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. There were no comparable gains recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFunds From Operations\nFunds from operations ( FFO\u201d), is a widely-recognized non-GAAP financial measure for REITs that the Company believes when considered with financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, provides additional and useful means to assess its financial performance. FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate the performance of REITs, most of which present FFO along with net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company computes FFO in accordance with the White Paper\u201d on FFO published by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), which defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring, sales of depreciable property, and impairments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for partnerships and unconsolidated joint ventures.\nHowever, FFO:\n\u2022does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP (which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income); and\n\u2022should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance.\nFFO as defined by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled items reported by other REITs due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) guidance relating to accounting for acquisitions that meet the definition of a business requires, among other things, an acquirer of a business to expense all acquisition costs related to the acquisition. Effective October 1, 2016, the Company prospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-1, Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business\u201d issued by the FASB which redefined the definition of a business, whereby an acquisition in which substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset is accounted for as an asset acquisition. As a result, transaction costs related to the acquisition are capitalized. See Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, during the three months ended December 31, 2016, the Company concluded that its acquisitions did not meet the definition of a business and accounted for such acquisitions as asset acquisitions and capitalized all transaction costs related to completed and in-process acquisitions. Acquisition costs that are expensed will reduce our FFO. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company expensed $824,000, $1.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, relating to real estate acquisitions.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of net income applicable to stockholders in accordance with GAAP to FFO for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands).\n\nCash Net Operating Income ( NOI\u201d)\nCash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of the Company's performance. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is operating income. The Company defines cash NOI as operating revenues (base rent and recoveries from tenants), less property and related expenses (property operating expenses and property taxes), adjusted for non-cash revenue and operating expense items such as straight-line rent and amortization of lease intangibles, debt-related expenses, and other adjustments. Cash NOI also excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, acquisition transaction costs, other expense, interest expense, gains and losses from property acquisitions and dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating cash NOI, and accordingly, the Company's cash NOI may not be comparable to other REITs.\nCash NOI is used by management internally to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the Company's properties. The Company believes cash NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those cash income and expense items that are incurred at the property level, and when compared across periods, can be used to determine trends in earnings of the Company's properties as this measure is not affected by non-cash revenue and expense recognition items, the cost of the Company's funding, the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses from the acquisition and sale of operating real estate assets, general and administrative expenses or other gains and losses that relate to the Company's ownership of properties. The Company believes the exclusion of these items from operating income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the Company's properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nCash NOI is a measure of the operating performance of the Company's properties but does not measure the Company's performance as a whole and is therefore not a substitute for net income or operating income as computed in accordance with GAAP.\nSame-Center Cash NOI\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of same-center cash NOI to consolidated operating income in accordance with GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The table makes reference to the effect of the same-center properties. Same-center properties, which totaled 61 of the Company's 82 properties as of December 31, 2016, represent all operating properties owned by the Company during the entirety of both periods presented and consolidated into the Company's financial statements during such periods (in thousands).\n\n______________________\n (1) Includes straight-line rents, amortization of above-market and below-market lease intangibles, anchor lease termination fees, net of contractual amounts, and expense and recovery adjustments related to prior periods. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company generated same-center cash NOI of approximately $125.7 million compared to same-center cash NOI of approximately $119.3 million generated during the year ended December 31, 2015, representing a 5.3% increase. This increase is primarily due to an increase in base rents and recoveries, slightly offset by a decrease in other property income.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of same-center cash NOI to consolidated operating income in accordance with GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The table makes reference to the effect of the same-center properties. Same-center properties, which totaled 53 of the Company's 73 properties as of December 31, 2015, represent all operating properties owned by the Company during the entirety of both periods presented and consolidated into the Company's financial statements during such periods (in thousands).\n\n______________________\n (1) Includes straight-line rents, amortization of above and below-market lease intangibles, anchor lease termination fees, net of contractual amounts, and expense and recovery adjustments related to prior periods. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company generated same-center cash NOI of approximately $95.1 million compared to same-center cash NOI of approximately $90.8 million generated during the year ended December 31, 2014, representing a 4.7% increase. This increase is primarily due to an increase in base rents and other property income, and a decrease in bad debt expense.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those that are both important to the presentation of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting estimates that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. This summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the Company's accounting policies included in Note 1 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records base rents on a straight-line basis over the term of each lease. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in tenant and other receivables on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Most leases contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro-rata share of real estate taxes and certain common area expenses. Adjustments are also made throughout the year to tenant and other receivables and the related cost recovery income based upon the Company's best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected. In addition, the Company also provides an allowance for future credit losses in connection with the deferred straight-line rent receivable.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on a quarterly analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts. The analysis places particular emphasis on past-due accounts and considers information such as the nature and age of the receivables, the payment history of the tenants or other debtors, the financial condition of the tenants and any guarantors and management's assessment of their ability to meet their lease obligations, the basis for any disputes and the status of related negotiations, among other things. Management's estimates of the required allowance is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on tenants, particularly those at retail properties. Estimates are used to establish reimbursements from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate tax and insurance costs. The Company analyzes the balance of its estimated accounts receivable for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance for each of its properties by comparing actual recoveries versus actual expenses and any actual write-offs. Based on its analysis, the Company may record an additional amount in its allowance for doubtful accounts related to these items. In addition, the Company also provides an allowance for future credit losses in connection with the deferred straight-line rent receivable.\nReal Estate Investments\nLand, buildings, property improvements, furniture/fixtures and tenant improvements are recorded at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Renovations and/or replacements, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\nThe Company recognizes the acquisition of real estate properties, including acquired tangible (consisting of land, buildings and improvements), and acquired intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above-market and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases) at their fair value (for acquisitions meeting the definition of a business) and relative fair value (for acquisitions not meeting the definition of a business). Acquired lease intangible assets include above-market leases and acquired in-place leases, and acquired lease intangible liabilities represent below-market leases, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, which value is then allocated to land, buildings and improvements based on management's determination of the relative fair values of these assets. In valuing an acquired property's intangibles, factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods based on its evaluation of current market demand. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases, including leasing commissions, tenant improvements, legal and other related costs.\nThe value of in-place leases is measured by the excess of (i) the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in-place leases to market rental rates, over (ii) the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant. Above-market and below-market lease values are recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be received and management's estimate of market lease rates, measured over the terms of the respective leases that management deemed appropriate at the time of acquisition. Such valuations include a consideration of the non-cancellable terms of the respective leases as well as any applicable renewal periods. The fair values\nassociated with below-market rental renewal options are determined based on the Company's experience and the relevant facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the acquisitions. The value of the above-market and below-market leases associated with the original lease term is amortized to rental income, over the terms of the respective leases. The value of in-place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancellable terms of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be recognized in operations at that time.\nThe Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful life of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation. These assessments have a direct impact on its net income.\nProperties are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows:\n\nAsset Impairment\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to aggregate future net cash flows (undiscounted and without interest) expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value.\nREIT Qualification Requirements\nThe Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, and believes that it has been organized and has operated in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code.\nThe Company is subject to a number of operational and organizational requirements to qualify and then maintain qualification as a REIT. If the Company does not qualify as a REIT, its income would become subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates that would be substantial and the Company may not be permitted to re-elect to qualify as a REIT for four taxable years following the year that it failed to qualify as a REIT. The Company's results of operations, liquidity and amounts distributable to stockholders would be significantly reduced.\nRecent U.S. Federal Income Tax Legislation\nOn December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, an omnibus spending bill, with a division referred to as the Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the PATH Act\u201d). The PATH Act changes certain of the rules affecting REIT qualification and taxation of REITs and REIT shareholders, which are briefly summarized below.\n \u2022 For taxable years beginning after 2017, the percentage of a REIT's total assets that may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs is reduced from 25% to 20%. \n \u2022 Publicly offered REITs\u201d (which generally include any REIT required to file annual and periodic reports with the SEC, including us) are no longer subject to the preferential dividend rules for taxable years beginning after 2014. \n \u2022 For taxable years beginning after 2015, debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs are qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% REIT asset test. However, no more than 25% of the value of a REIT's assets may consist of debt instruments that are issued by publicly offered REITs that are not otherwise treated as real estate assets, and interest on debt of a publicly offered REIT will not be qualifying income under the 75% REIT gross income test unless the debt is secured by real property. \n \u2022 For taxable years beginning after 2015, to the extent rent attributable to personal property is treated as rents from real property (because rent attributable to the personal property for the taxable year does not exceed 15% of the total rent for the taxable year for such real and personal property), the personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for \npurposes of the 75% REIT asset test. Similarly, a debt obligation secured by a mortgage on both real and personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test, and interest thereon will be treated as interest on an obligation secured by real property, if the fair market value of the personal property does not exceed 15% of the fair market value of all property securing the debt.\n \u2022 For taxable years beginning after 2014, the period during which dispositions of properties with net built-in gains from C corporations in carry-over basis transactions will trigger the built-in gains tax is reduced from ten years to five years. \n \u2022 For taxable years beginning after 2015, a 100% excise tax will apply to redetermined services income,\u201d i.e., non-arm's-length income of a REIT's TRS attributable to services provided to, or on behalf of, the REIT (other than services provided to REIT tenants, which are potentially taxed as redetermined rents). \n \u2022 The rate of withholding tax applicable under FIRPTA to certain sales and other dispositions of U.S. real property interests ( USRPIs\u201d) by non-U.S. persons, and certain distributions from corporations whose stock may constitute a USRPI, is increased from 10% to 15% for dispositions and distributions occurring after February 16, 2016. \n \u2022 For dispositions and distributions on or after December 18, 2015, the stock ownership thresholds for exemption from FIRPTA taxation on sale of stock of a publicly traded REIT and for recharacterizing capital gain dividends received from a publicly traded REIT as ordinary dividends is increased from not more than 5% to not more than 10%. \n \u2022 Effective December 18, 2015, certain look-through, presumption, and other rules will apply for purposes of determining if we qualify as domestically controlled. \n \u2022 For dispositions and distributions after December 18, 2015, certain qualified foreign pension funds\u201d satisfying certain requirements, as well as entities that are wholly owned by a qualified foreign pension fund, are exempt from income and withholding taxes applicable under FIRPTA. In addition, new FIRPTA rules apply to ownership of REIT shares by qualified shareholders,\u201d which generally include publicly traded non-U.S. stockholders meeting certain requirements. \n \u2022 For taxable years beginning after 2015, alternative methodology for satisfaction of prohibited transactions safe harbor is available, whereby the safe harbor requirement can be satisfied if (i) the aggregate tax basis or fair market value of the property sold in the taxable year is not more than 20% of the aggregate tax basis or fair market value of all of the REIT's assets and (ii) the average adjusted tax basis or average fair market value of the property sold over the three-year period is not more than 10% of the aggregate tax basis or fair market value of all of the REIT's assets. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources of the Company\nIn this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company\u201d section and in the Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership\u201d section, the term the Company\u201d refers to Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding the Operating Partnership.\nThe Company's business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership, of which the Company is the parent company, and which it consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Because the Company operates on a consolidated basis with the Operating Partnership, the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership\u201d should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the Company on a consolidated basis and how the Company is operated as a whole.\nThe Company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company. The Company itself does not hold any indebtedness other than guarantees of indebtedness of the Operating Partnership, and its only material assets are its ownership of direct or indirect partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and membership interest in Retail Opportunity Investments GP, LLC, the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the consolidated assets and liabilities and the consolidated revenues and expenses of the Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. However, all debt is held directly or indirectly by the Operating Partnership. The Company's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common stock. The Company's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership.\nAs the parent company of the Operating Partnership, the Company, indirectly, has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management and control. The Company causes the Operating Partnership to distribute\nsuch portion of its available cash as the Company may in its discretion determine, in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement.\nThe Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with an effective shelf registration statement filed in May 2016 that allows the Company to register unspecified various classes of debt and equity securities. As circumstances warrant, the Company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. Any proceeds from such equity issuances would be contributed to the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to acquire additional properties, pay down debt, and for general working capital purposes.\nLiquidity is a measure of the Company's ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain its assets and operations, make distributions to its stockholders and meet other general business needs. The liquidity of the Company is dependent on the Operating Partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to the Company. The primary cash requirement of the Company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's primary sources of cash were distributions from the Operating Partnership and proceeds from the issuance of common stock. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has determined that it has adequate working capital to meet its dividend funding obligations for the next twelve months.\nOn July 12, 2016, ROIC issued 6,555,000 shares of common stock in a registered public offering, including shares issued upon the exercise in full of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $133.0 million, after deducting the underwriters' discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, ROIC entered into four separate Sales Agreements (the Original Sales Agreements\u201d) with each of Jefferies LLC, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., MLV & Co. LLC and Raymond James & Associates, Inc. (each individually, an Original Agent\u201d and collectively, the Original Agents\u201d) pursuant to which ROIC may sell, from time to time, shares of ROIC's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million through the Original Agents either as agents or principals. On May 23, 2016, ROIC entered into two additional sales agreements (the Additional Sales Agreements\u201d, and together with the Original Sales Agreements, the Sales Agreements\u201d) with each of Canaccord Genuity Inc. and Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated (the Additional Agents\u201d, and together with the Original Agents, the Agents\u201d) pursuant to which the Company may sell shares of ROIC's common stock through the Additional Agents either as agents or principals. In addition, on May 19, 2016, the Company terminated the Original Sales Agreement with MLV & Co. LLC. During the year ended December 31, 2016, ROIC sold a total of 2,202,254 shares of common stock under the Sales Agreements, which resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $45.6 million and commissions of approximately $584,000 paid to the Agents.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, dividends paid to stockholders totaled approximately $75.7 million. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the Operating Partnership made distributions of approximately $8.4 million to the non-controlling interest OP Unitholders. On a consolidated basis, cash flows from operations for the same period totaled approximately $114.7 million.

The initial maturity date of the term loan is January 31, 2019, subject to two one-year extension options, which may be exercised upon satisfaction of certain conditions including the payment of extension fees. Borrowings under the term loan agreement bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to an applicable rate based on the credit rating level of the Company, plus, as applicable, (i) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the relevant period (the Eurodollar Rate\u201d), or (ii) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the rate of interest announced by the Administrative Agent as its \"prime rate,\" and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.10%.\nThe Operating Partnership has an unsecured revolving credit facility with several banks which provides for borrowings of up to $500.0 million.

The Company has investment grade credit ratings from Moody's Investors Service (Baa2) and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (BBB-). Borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to an applicable rate based on the credit rating level of the Company, plus, as applicable, (i) the Eurodollar Rate, or (ii) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the rate of interest announced by KeyBank, National Association at its prime rate,\u201d and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%. Additionally, the Operating Partnership is obligated to pay a facility fee at a rate based on the credit rating level of the Company, currently 0.20%, and a fronting fee at a rate of 0.125% per year with respect to each letter of credit issued under the credit facility.\nBoth the term loan and credit facility contain customary representations, financial and other covenants. The Operating Partnership's ability to borrow under the credit facility and term loan is subject to its compliance with financial covenants and other restrictions on an ongoing basis. The Operating Partnership was in compliance with such covenants at December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, $300.0 million and $98.0 million were outstanding under the term loan and credit facility, respectively.

The Senior Notes Due 2026 pay interest on March 22 and September 22 of each year, commencing on March 22, 2017, and mature on September 22, 2026, unless prepaid earlier by the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership's performance of the obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement, including the payment of any outstanding indebtedness thereunder, are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by ROIC.\nFurther, the Operating Partnership issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in December 2014 and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in December 2013, each of which were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ROIC.\nWhile the Operating Partnership generally intends to hold its assets as long term investments, certain of its investments may be sold in order to manage the Operating Partnership's interest rate risk and liquidity needs, meet other operating objectives and adapt to market conditions. The timing and impact of future sales of its investments, if any, cannot be predicted with any certainty.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):\n\nNet Cash Flows from:\nOperating Activities\nIncrease in cash flows provided by operating activities from 2015 to 2016:\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $114.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $86.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash flows provided by operating activities increased by approximately $27.8 million primarily due to an increase in property operating income of approximately $35.4 million, offset by an increase in interest expense of approximately $6.5 million due to higher borrowing amounts in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nIncrease in cash flows provided by operating activities from 2014 to 2015:\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $86.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $65.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, cash flows provided by financing activities decreased approximately $89.2 million, primarily due to a decrease of $246.5 million of net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes with no issuance in 2015, the decrease of approximately $70.7 million in proceeds from the exercise of warrants in 2014, the decrease of approximately $113.6 million in proceeds from the sale of common stock, an increase of approximately $62.3 million in principal repayments on mortgages, a net decrease of approximately $119.3 million in proceeds from draws on the credit facility, and an increase of approximately $13.0 million in distributions paid to common shareholders and OP unit holders.

Borrowings under the term loan accrue interest at a rate equal to an applicable rate based on the credit rating level of the Company, plus, as applicable (i) the Eurodollar Rate, or (ii) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the rate of interest announced by the Administrative Agent as its prime rate,\u201d and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.10%. \n (3) For the purpose of the above table, the Company has assumed that borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at the average interest rate on the credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2016 which was 1.5%. Borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a rate equal to an applicable rate based on the credit rating level of the Company, plus, as applicable (i) the Eurodollar Rate, or (ii) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the rate of interest announced by KeyBank, National Association as its prime rate,\u201d and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%. \n (4) Represents payments of interest only in years 2017 through 2021 and payments of both principal and interest thereafter. \nThe Company has committed approximately $34.6 million and $2.1 million in tenant improvements (including building and site improvements) and leasing commissions, respectively, for the new leases and renewals that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company did not have any capital lease obligations.\nThe Company has entered into several lease agreements with an officer of the Company. Pursuant to the lease agreements, the Company is provided the use of storage space.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nReal Estate Taxes\nThe Company's leases generally require the tenants to be responsible for a pro rata portion of the real estate taxes.\nInflation\nThe Company's long-term leases contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on its operating results. Such provisions include clauses entitling the Company to receive (a) scheduled base rent increases and (b) percentage rents based upon tenants' gross sales which generally increase as prices rise. In addition, many of the Company's non-anchor leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits the Company to seek increases in rents upon renewal at then-current market rates if rents provided in the expiring leases are below then-existing market rates. Most of the Company's leases require tenants to pay a share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, thereby reducing the Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.\nLeverage Policies\nThe Company employs prudent amounts of leverage and uses debt as a", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company makes statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information.\u201d Certain risk factors may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nThe Company is organized in an UpREIT format pursuant to which Retail Opportunity Investments GP, LLC, its wholly-owned subsidiary, serves as the general partner of, and ROIC conducts substantially all of its business through, its Operating Partnership, Retail Opportunity Investments Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, together with its subsidiaries.\nROIC commenced operations in October 2009 as a fully integrated and self-managed REIT, and as of December 31, 2016, ROIC owned an approximate 90.3% partnership interest and other limited partners owned the remaining 9.7% partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. ROIC specializes in the acquisition, ownership and management of necessity-based community and neighborhood shopping centers on the west coast of the United States, anchored by supermarkets and drugstores.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company's portfolio consisted of 82 properties (81 retail and one office) totaling approximately 9.4 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's portfolio was approximately 97.6% leased. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company leased and renewed approximately 585,000 and 763,000 square feet, respectively, in its portfolio.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of beginning of year vacant space to end of year vacant space as of December 31, 2016.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Vacant Space Square Footage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vacant space at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>238,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Square footage vacated\n</td> <td>281,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vacant space in acquired properties\n</td> <td>20,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Square footage leased\n</td> <td>(302,259\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vacant space at December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>237,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has committed approximately $33.8 million, or $58.90 per square foot, in tenant improvements, including building and site improvements, for new leases that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company has committed approximately $2.0 million, or $3.46 per square foot, in leasing commissions for the new leases that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, the Company has committed approximately $737,000, or $0.97 per square foot, in tenant improvements for renewed leases that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016. Leasing commission commitments for renewed leases were not material for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResults of Operations\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had 82 properties (81 retail and one office), all of which are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements. The Company believes, because of the location of the properties in densely populated areas, the nature of its investments provides for relatively stable revenue flows even during difficult economic times. The Company has a strong capital structure with manageable debt as of December 31, 2016. The Company expects to continue to actively explore acquisition opportunities consistent with its business strategy.\nProperty operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. The Company defines property operating income as operating revenues (base rent, recoveries from tenants and other income), less property and related expenses (property operating expenses and property taxes). Property operating income excludes general and administrative expenses, mortgage interest income, depreciation and amortization, acquisition transaction costs, other expense, interest expense, gains and losses from property acquisitions and dispositions, equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures, extraordinary items, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating property operating income, and accordingly, the Company's property operating income may not be comparable to other REITs.\nProperty operating income is used by management to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the Company's properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of the Company's properties as this measure is not affected by the cost of our funding, the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses from the acquisition and sale of operating real estate assets, general and administrative expenses or other gains and losses that relate to our ownership of our properties. The Company believes the exclusion of these items from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the Company's properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nProperty operating income is a measure of the operating performance of the Company's properties but does not measure the Company's performance as a whole. Property operating income is therefore not a substitute for net income or operating income as computed in accordance with GAAP.\nResults of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nProperty Operating Income\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of consolidated operating income in accordance with GAAP to consolidated property operating income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands).\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income per GAAP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus:\n</td> <td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>88,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>13,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition transaction costs\n</td> <td>824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>627\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following comparison for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, makes reference to the effect of the same-center properties.

Property operating income increased by $35.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in the number of properties owned by the Company in 2016 compared to 2015 and an increase in same-center properties' operating income. As of December 31, 2016, the Company owned 82 properties as compared to 73 properties at December 31, 2015. The properties acquired during 2016 and 2015 increased property operating income in 2016 by approximately $30.7 million. The 61 same-center properties increased property operating income by approximately $4.7 million. This increase is primarily due to an increase in base rents.\nDepreciation and amortization\nThe Company incurred depreciation and amortization expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $88.4 million compared to $71.0 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015.

General and administrative expenses increased approximately $470,000 primarily as a result of an increase in compensation-related expenses.\nAcquisition transaction costs\nThe Company incurred property acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $824,000, which is consistent with the $965,000 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest expense and other finance expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred approximately $40.7 million of interest expense compared to approximately $34.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense increased approximately $6.5 million primarily due to a higher debt level as a result of acquisitions and interest incurred related to the Senior Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016.\nResults of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nProperty Operating Income\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of consolidated operating income in accordance with GAAP to consolidated property operating income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands).\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income per GAAP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus:\n</td> <td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>70,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>12,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition transaction costs\n</td> <td>965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>961\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following comparison for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, makes reference to the effect of the same-center properties.

Property operating income increased by $29.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in the number of properties owned by the Company in 2015 compared to 2014 and an increase in same-center properties' operating income. As of December 31, 2015, the Company owned 73 properties as compared to 61 properties at December 31, 2014. The properties acquired during 2015 and 2014 increased property operating income in 2015 by approximately $23.8 million. The 53 same-center properties increased property operating income by approximately $5.8 million. This increase is primarily due to an increase in base rents and other property income.\nDepreciation and amortization\nThe Company incurred depreciation and amortization expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 of approximately $71.0 million compared to $58.4 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in 2015 as a result of an increase in the number of properties owned by the Company in 2015 compared to 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nThe Company incurred general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 of approximately $12.7 million compared to $11.2 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $1.5 million primarily as a result of an increase in compensation-related expenses.\nAcquisition transaction costs\nThe Company incurred property acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2015 of approximately $965,000, which is consistent with the $961,000 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense and other finance expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred approximately $34.2 million of interest expense compared to approximately $27.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest expense increased approximately $6.7 million primarily due to a higher debt level as a result of acquisitions, interest incurred related to the Senior Notes Due 2024 issued in December 2014, slightly offset by a decrease in interest related to the Company's interest rate swaps, as the Company's prior swaps were cash settled in 2014.\nGain on sale of property\nOn June 5, 2014, the Company sold Phillips Village Shopping Center, a non-core shopping center located in Pomona, California with an occupancy rate of approximately 10.4% as of May 31, 2014. The sales price of this property of approximately $16.0 million, less costs to sell, resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $15.6 million. The Company recorded a gain on sale of approximately $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, on August 25, 2014, the Company sold the Oregon City Point Shopping Center, a non-core shopping center located in Oregon City, Oregon. The sales price of this property of approximately $12.4 million, less costs to sell, resulted in net proceeds of approximately $12.0 million. The Company recorded a gain on sale of approximately $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. There were no comparable gains recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFunds From Operations\nFunds from operations ( FFO\u201d), is a widely-recognized non-GAAP financial measure for REITs that the Company believes when considered with financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, provides additional and useful means to assess its financial performance. FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate the performance of REITs, most of which present FFO along with net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company computes FFO in accordance with the White Paper\u201d on FFO published by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), which defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring, sales of depreciable property, and impairments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for partnerships and unconsolidated joint ventures.\nHowever, FFO:\n\u2022does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP (which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income); and\n\u2022should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance.\nFFO as defined by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled items reported by other REITs due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) guidance relating to accounting for acquisitions that meet the definition of a business requires, among other things, an acquirer of a business to expense all acquisition costs related to the acquisition. Effective October 1, 2016, the Company prospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-1, Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business\u201d issued by the FASB which redefined the definition of a business, whereby an acquisition in which substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset is accounted for as an asset acquisition. As a result, transaction costs related to the acquisition are capitalized. See Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, during the three months ended December 31, 2016, the Company concluded that its acquisitions did not meet the definition of a business and accounted for such acquisitions as asset acquisitions and capitalized all transaction costs related to completed and in-process acquisitions. Acquisition costs that are expensed will reduce our FFO. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company expensed $824,000, $1.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, relating to real estate acquisitions.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of net income applicable to stockholders in accordance with GAAP to FFO for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands).\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to ROIC\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>88,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of real estate\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,869\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations - basic\n</td> <td>121,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>3,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>749\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations - diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Net Operating Income ( NOI\u201d)\nCash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of the Company's performance. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is operating income. The Company defines cash NOI as operating revenues (base rent and recoveries from tenants), less property and related expenses (property operating expenses and property taxes), adjusted for non-cash revenue and operating expense items such as straight-line rent and amortization of lease intangibles, debt-related expenses, and other adjustments. Cash NOI also excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, acquisition transaction costs, other expense, interest expense, gains and losses from property acquisitions and dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating cash NOI, and accordingly, the Company's cash NOI may not be comparable to other REITs.\nCash NOI is used by management internally to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the Company's properties. The Company believes cash NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those cash income and expense items that are incurred at the property level, and when compared across periods, can be used to determine trends in earnings of the Company's properties as this measure is not affected by non-cash revenue and expense recognition items, the cost of the Company's funding, the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses from the acquisition and sale of operating real estate assets, general and administrative expenses or other gains and losses that relate to the Company's ownership of properties. The Company believes the exclusion of these items from operating income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the Company's properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nCash NOI is a measure of the operating performance of the Company's properties but does not measure the Company's performance as a whole and is therefore not a substitute for net income or operating income as computed in accordance with GAAP.\nSame-Center Cash NOI\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of same-center cash NOI to consolidated operating income in accordance with GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The table makes reference to the effect of the same-center properties. Same-center properties, which totaled 61 of the Company's 82 properties as of December 31, 2016, represent all operating properties owned by the Company during the entirety of both periods presented and consolidated into the Company's financial statements during such periods (in thousands).\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same-center cash NOI\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non same-center cash NOI\n</td> <td>35,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Company cash NOI\n</td> <td>161,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>(88,359\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70,957\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>(13,120\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,650\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition transaction costs\n</td> <td>(824\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(965\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>(456\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(627\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property revenues and expenses (1)\n</td> <td>18,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\n (1) Includes straight-line rents, amortization of above-market and below-market lease intangibles, anchor lease termination fees, net of contractual amounts, and expense and recovery adjustments related to prior periods. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company generated same-center cash NOI of approximately $125.7 million compared to same-center cash NOI of approximately $119.3 million generated during the year ended December 31, 2015, representing a 5.3% increase. This increase is primarily due to an increase in base rents and recoveries, slightly offset by a decrease in other property income.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of same-center cash NOI to consolidated operating income in accordance with GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

This increase is primarily due to an increase in base rents and other property income, and a decrease in bad debt expense.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those that are both important to the presentation of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting estimates that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. This summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the Company's accounting policies included in Note 1 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records base rents on a straight-line basis over the term of each lease. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in tenant and other receivables on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Most leases contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro-rata share of real estate taxes and certain common area expenses. Adjustments are also made throughout the year to tenant and other receivables and the related cost recovery income based upon the Company's best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected. In addition, the Company also provides an allowance for future credit losses in connection with the deferred straight-line rent receivable.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on a quarterly analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts. The analysis places particular emphasis on past-due accounts and considers information such as the nature and age of the receivables, the payment history of the tenants or other debtors, the financial condition of the tenants and any guarantors and management's assessment of their ability to meet their lease obligations, the basis for any disputes and the status of related negotiations, among other things. Management's estimates of the required allowance is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on tenants, particularly those at retail properties. Estimates are used to establish reimbursements from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate tax and insurance costs. The Company analyzes the balance of its estimated accounts receivable for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance for each of its properties by comparing actual recoveries versus actual expenses and any actual write-offs. Based on its analysis, the Company may record an additional amount in its allowance for doubtful accounts related to these items. In addition, the Company also provides an allowance for future credit losses in connection with the deferred straight-line rent receivable.\nReal Estate Investments\nLand, buildings, property improvements, furniture/fixtures and tenant improvements are recorded at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Renovations and/or replacements, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\nThe Company recognizes the acquisition of real estate properties, including acquired tangible (consisting of land, buildings and improvements), and acquired intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above-market and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases) at their fair value (for acquisitions meeting the definition of a business) and relative fair value (for acquisitions not meeting the definition of a business). Acquired lease intangible assets include above-market leases and acquired in-place leases, and acquired lease intangible liabilities represent below-market leases, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, which value is then allocated to land, buildings and improvements based on management's determination of the relative fair values of these assets. In valuing an acquired property's intangibles, factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods based on its evaluation of current market demand. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases, including leasing commissions, tenant improvements, legal and other related costs.\nThe value of in-place leases is measured by the excess of (i) the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in-place leases to market rental rates, over (ii) the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant. Above-market and below-market lease values are recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be received and management's estimate of market lease rates, measured over the terms of the respective leases that management deemed appropriate at the time of acquisition. Such valuations include a consideration of the non-cancellable terms of the respective leases as well as any applicable renewal periods. The fair values\nassociated with below-market rental renewal options are determined based on the Company's experience and the relevant facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the acquisitions. The value of the above-market and below-market leases associated with the original lease term is amortized to rental income, over the terms of the respective leases. The value of in-place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancellable terms of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be recognized in operations at that time.\nThe Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful life of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation. These assessments have a direct impact on its net income.\nProperties are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Buildings\n</td> <td>39-40 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property Improvements\n</td> <td>10-20 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Furniture/Fixtures\n</td> <td>3-10 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant Improvements\n</td> <td>Shorter of lease term or their useful life\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsset Impairment\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to aggregate future net cash flows (undiscounted and without interest) expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value.\nREIT Qualification Requirements\nThe Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, and believes that it has been organized and has operated in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code.\nThe Company is subject to a number of operational and organizational requirements to qualify and then maintain qualification as a REIT. If the Company does not qualify as a REIT, its income would become subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates that would be substantial and the Company may not be permitted to re-elect to qualify as a REIT for four taxable years following the year that it failed to qualify as a REIT. The Company's results of operations, liquidity and amounts distributable to stockholders would be significantly reduced.\nRecent U.S. Federal Income Tax Legislation\nOn December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, an omnibus spending bill, with a division referred to as the Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the PATH Act\u201d). The PATH Act changes certain of the rules affecting REIT qualification and taxation of REITs and REIT shareholders, which are briefly summarized below.\n \u2022 For taxable years beginning after 2017, the percentage of a REIT's total assets that may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs is reduced from 25% to 20%. \n \u2022 Publicly offered REITs\u201d (which generally include any REIT required to file annual and periodic reports with the SEC, including us) are no longer subject to the preferential dividend rules for taxable years beginning after 2014. \n \u2022 For taxable years beginning after 2015, debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs are qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% REIT asset test. However, no more than 25% of the value of a REIT's assets may consist of debt instruments that are issued by publicly offered REITs that are not otherwise treated as real estate assets, and interest on debt of a publicly offered REIT will not be qualifying income under the 75% REIT gross income test unless the debt is secured by real property. \n \u2022 For taxable years beginning after 2015, to the extent rent attributable to personal property is treated as rents from real property (because rent attributable to the personal property for the taxable year does not exceed 15% of the total rent for the taxable year for such real and personal property), the personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for \npurposes of the 75% REIT asset test. Similarly, a debt obligation secured by a mortgage on both real and personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test, and interest thereon will be treated as interest on an obligation secured by real property, if the fair market value of the personal property does not exceed 15% of the fair market value of all property securing the debt.\n \u2022 For taxable years beginning after 2014, the period during which dispositions of properties with net built-in gains from C corporations in carry-over basis transactions will trigger the built-in gains tax is reduced from ten years to five years. \n \u2022 For taxable years beginning after 2015, a 100% excise tax will apply to redetermined services income,\u201d i.e., non-arm's-length income of a REIT's TRS attributable to services provided to, or on behalf of, the REIT (other than services provided to REIT tenants, which are potentially taxed as redetermined rents). \n \u2022 The rate of withholding tax applicable under FIRPTA to certain sales and other dispositions of U.S. real property interests ( USRPIs\u201d) by non-U.S. persons, and certain distributions from corporations whose stock may constitute a USRPI, is increased from 10% to 15% for dispositions and distributions occurring after February 16, 2016. \n \u2022 For dispositions and distributions on or after December 18, 2015, the stock ownership thresholds for exemption from FIRPTA taxation on sale of stock of a publicly traded REIT and for recharacterizing capital gain dividends received from a publicly traded REIT as ordinary dividends is increased from not more than 5% to not more than 10%. \n \u2022 Effective December 18, 2015, certain look-through, presumption, and other rules will apply for purposes of determining if we qualify as domestically controlled. \n \u2022 For dispositions and distributions after December 18, 2015, certain qualified foreign pension funds\u201d satisfying certain requirements, as well as entities that are wholly owned by a qualified foreign pension fund, are exempt from income and withholding taxes applicable under FIRPTA. In addition, new FIRPTA rules apply to ownership of REIT shares by qualified shareholders,\u201d which generally include publicly traded non-U.S. stockholders meeting certain requirements. \n \u2022 For taxable years beginning after 2015, alternative methodology for satisfaction of prohibited transactions safe harbor is available, whereby the safe harbor requirement can be satisfied if (i) the aggregate tax basis or fair market value of the property sold in the taxable year is not more than 20% of the aggregate tax basis or fair market value of all of the REIT's assets and (ii) the average adjusted tax basis or average fair market value of the property sold over the three-year period is not more than 10% of the aggregate tax basis or fair market value of all of the REIT's assets. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources of the Company\nIn this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company\u201d section and in the Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership\u201d section, the term the Company\u201d refers to Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding the Operating Partnership.\nThe Company's business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership, of which the Company is the parent company, and which it consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Because the Company operates on a consolidated basis with the Operating Partnership, the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership\u201d should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the Company on a consolidated basis and how the Company is operated as a whole.\nThe Company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company. The Company itself does not hold any indebtedness other than guarantees of indebtedness of the Operating Partnership, and its only material assets are its ownership of direct or indirect partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and membership interest in Retail Opportunity Investments GP, LLC, the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the consolidated assets and liabilities and the consolidated revenues and expenses of the Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. However, all debt is held directly or indirectly by the Operating Partnership. The Company's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common stock. The Company's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership.\nAs the parent company of the Operating Partnership, the Company, indirectly, has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management and control. The Company causes the Operating Partnership to distribute\nsuch portion of its available cash as the Company may in its discretion determine, in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement.\nThe Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with an effective shelf registration statement filed in May 2016 that allows the Company to register unspecified various classes of debt and equity securities. As circumstances warrant, the Company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. Any proceeds from such equity issuances would be contributed to the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to acquire additional properties, pay down debt, and for general working capital purposes.\nLiquidity is a measure of the Company's ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain its assets and operations, make distributions to its stockholders and meet other general business needs. The liquidity of the Company is dependent on the Operating Partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to the Company. The primary cash requirement of the Company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's primary sources of cash were distributions from the Operating Partnership and proceeds from the issuance of common stock. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has determined that it has adequate working capital to meet its dividend funding obligations for the next twelve months.\nOn July 12, 2016, ROIC issued 6,555,000 shares of common stock in a registered public offering, including shares issued upon the exercise in full of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $133.0 million, after deducting the underwriters' discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, ROIC entered into four separate Sales Agreements (the Original Sales Agreements\u201d) with each of Jefferies LLC, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., MLV & Co. LLC and Raymond James & Associates, Inc. (each individually, an Original Agent\u201d and collectively, the Original Agents\u201d) pursuant to which ROIC may sell, from time to time, shares of ROIC's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million through the Original Agents either as agents or principals. On May 23, 2016, ROIC entered into two additional sales agreements (the Additional Sales Agreements\u201d, and together with the Original Sales Agreements, the Sales Agreements\u201d) with each of Canaccord Genuity Inc. and Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated (the Additional Agents\u201d, and together with the Original Agents, the Agents\u201d) pursuant to which the Company may sell shares of ROIC's common stock through the Additional Agents either as agents or principals. In addition, on May 19, 2016, the Company terminated the Original Sales Agreement with MLV & Co. LLC. During the year ended December 31, 2016, ROIC sold a total of 2,202,254 shares of common stock under the Sales Agreements, which resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $45.6 million and commissions of approximately $584,000 paid to the Agents.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, dividends paid to stockholders totaled approximately $75.7 million. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the Operating Partnership made distributions of approximately $8.4 million to the non-controlling interest OP Unitholders. On a consolidated basis, cash flows from operations for the same period totaled approximately $114.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, dividends paid to stockholders totaled approximately $65.8 million. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Operating Partnership made distributions of approximately $2.8 million to the non-controlling interest OP Unitholders. On a consolidated basis, cash flows from operations for the same period totaled approximately $86.9 million.\nPotential future sources of capital include equity issuances and distributions from the Operating Partnership.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership\nIn this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership\u201d section, the terms the Operating Partnership,\u201d we\u201d, our\u201d and us\u201d refer to the Operating Partnership together with its consolidated subsidiaries or the Operating Partnership and the Company together with their respective consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Operating Partnership's primary sources of cash were (i) proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured debt, (ii) cash flow from operations, (iii) proceeds from bank borrowings under the credit facility, and (iv) cash contributed by ROIC from the issuance of common stock. As of December 31, 2016, the Operating Partnership has determined that it has adequate working capital to meet its debt obligations and operating expenses for the next twelve months.\nOn September 29, 2015, the Company entered into a term loan agreement with KeyBank National Association, as Administrative Agent, and U.S. Bank National Association, as Syndication Agent and the other lenders party thereto, under which the lenders agreed to provide a $300.0 million unsecured term loan facility. The term loan agreement also provides that the Company may from time to time request increased aggregate commitments of $200.0 million under certain conditions set forth in the term loan\nagreement, including the consent of the lenders for the additional commitments. The initial maturity date of the term loan is January 31, 2019, subject to two one-year extension options, which may be exercised upon satisfaction of certain conditions including the payment of extension fees. Borrowings under the term loan agreement bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to an applicable rate based on the credit rating level of the Company, plus, as applicable, (i) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the relevant period (the Eurodollar Rate\u201d), or (ii) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the rate of interest announced by the Administrative Agent as its \"prime rate,\" and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.10%.\nThe Operating Partnership has an unsecured revolving credit facility with several banks which provides for borrowings of up to $500.0 million. Additionally, the credit facility contains an accordion feature, which allows the Operating Partnership to increase the facility amount up to an aggregate of $1.0 billion, subject to lender consents and other conditions. The maturity date of the credit facility is January 31, 2019, subject to a further one-year extension option, which may be exercised by the Operating Partnership upon satisfaction of certain conditions. The Company has investment grade credit ratings from Moody's Investors Service (Baa2) and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (BBB-). Borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to an applicable rate based on the credit rating level of the Company, plus, as applicable, (i) the Eurodollar Rate, or (ii) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the rate of interest announced by KeyBank, National Association at its prime rate,\u201d and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%. Additionally, the Operating Partnership is obligated to pay a facility fee at a rate based on the credit rating level of the Company, currently 0.20%, and a fronting fee at a rate of 0.125% per year with respect to each letter of credit issued under the credit facility.\nBoth the term loan and credit facility contain customary representations, financial and other covenants. The Operating Partnership's ability to borrow under the credit facility and term loan is subject to its compliance with financial covenants and other restrictions on an ongoing basis. The Operating Partnership was in compliance with such covenants at December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, $300.0 million and $98.0 million were outstanding under the term loan and credit facility, respectively. The average interest rates on the term loan and the credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2016 were 1.6% and 1.5%, respectively. The Company had no available borrowings under the term loan at December 31, 2016. The Company had $402.0 million available to borrow under the credit facility at December 31, 2016.\nOn July 26, 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, as amended, which provided for the issuance of $200.0 million principal amount of 3.95% Senior Notes Due 2026 in a private placement. The Senior Notes Due 2026 pay interest on March 22 and September 22 of each year, commencing on March 22, 2017, and mature on September 22, 2026, unless prepaid earlier by the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership's performance of the obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement, including the payment of any outstanding indebtedness thereunder, are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by ROIC.\nFurther, the Operating Partnership issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in December 2014 and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in December 2013, each of which were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ROIC.\nWhile the Operating Partnership generally intends to hold its assets as long term investments, certain of its investments may be sold in order to manage the Operating Partnership's interest rate risk and liquidity needs, meet other operating objectives and adapt to market conditions. The timing and impact of future sales of its investments, if any, cannot be predicted with any certainty.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Provided by (Used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(325,090\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(337,115\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(399,856\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>214,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Flows from:\nOperating Activities\nIncrease in cash flows provided by operating activities from 2015 to 2016:\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $114.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $86.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash flows provided by operating activities increased by approximately $27.8 million primarily due to an increase in property operating income of approximately $35.4 million, offset by an increase in interest expense of approximately $6.5 million due to higher borrowing amounts in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nIncrease in cash flows provided by operating activities from 2014 to 2015:\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $86.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $65.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash flows provided by financing activities decreased approximately $33.6 million, primarily due to a decrease of $300 million in proceeds from the term loan received during the year ended December 31, 2015, a net decrease of approximately $16.5 million in proceeds received from draws on the credit facility, a decrease of approximately $35.5 million in mortgage proceeds received during the year ended December 31, 2015, and an increase in cash redemption of OP units of approximately $38.8 million. These decreases were offset by proceeds received of $200.0 million related to the issuance of the Senior Notes Due 2026 during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of approximately $76.5 million in principal repayments on mortgages and an increase of approximately $83.6 million in proceeds from the sale of common stock.\nDecrease in cash flows provided by financing activities from 2014 to 2015:\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities amounted to $248.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $337.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, cash flows provided by financing activities decreased approximately $89.2 million, primarily due to a decrease of $246.5 million of net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes with no issuance in 2015, the decrease of approximately $70.7 million in proceeds from the exercise of warrants in 2014, the decrease of approximately $113.6 million in proceeds from the sale of common stock, an increase of approximately $62.3 million in principal repayments on mortgages, a net decrease of approximately $119.3 million in proceeds from draws on the credit facility, and an increase of approximately $13.0 million in distributions paid to common shareholders and OP unit holders. These decreases were offset by a $500.0 million increase related to the term loan consisting of $300.0 million\nin proceeds received during the year ended December 31, 2015 and $200.0 million in payments made during the year ended December 31, 2014, and an increase of $35.5 million in proceeds from a new mortgage loan received during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents the Company's operating lease obligations and the principal and interest amounts of the Company's long-term debt maturing each year, including amortization of principal based on debt outstanding, at December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage Notes Payable Principal (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage Notes Payable Interest\n</td> <td>3,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan (2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facility (3)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes Due 2026 (4)\n</td> <td>7,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>279,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes Due 2024 (4)\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>330,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes Due 2023 (4)\n</td> <td>12,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>275,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>337,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>1,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>878,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,473,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n (1) Does not include unamortized mortgage premium of approximately $1.0 million as of December 31, 2016. \n (2) For the purpose of the above table, the Company has assumed that borrowings under the term loan accrue interest at the average interest rate on the term loan during the year ended December 31, 2016 which was 1.6%. Borrowings under the term loan accrue interest at a rate equal to an applicable rate based on the credit rating level of the Company, plus, as applicable (i) the Eurodollar Rate, or (ii) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the rate of interest announced by the Administrative Agent as its prime rate,\u201d and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.10%. \n (3) For the purpose of the above table, the Company has assumed that borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at the average interest rate on the credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2016 which was 1.5%. Borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a rate equal to an applicable rate based on the credit rating level of the Company, plus, as applicable (i) the Eurodollar Rate, or (ii) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the rate of interest announced by KeyBank, National Association as its prime rate,\u201d and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%. \n (4) Represents payments of interest only in years 2017 through 2021 and payments of both principal and interest thereafter. \nThe Company has committed approximately $34.6 million and $2.1 million in tenant improvements (including building and site improvements) and leasing commissions, respectively, for the new leases and renewals that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company did not have any capital lease obligations.\nThe Company has entered into several lease agreements with an officer of the Company. Pursuant to the lease agreements, the Company is provided the use of storage space.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nReal Estate Taxes\nThe Company's leases generally require the tenants to be responsible for a pro rata portion of the real estate taxes.\nInflation\nThe Company's long-term leases contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on its operating results. Such provisions include clauses entitling the Company to receive (a) scheduled base rent increases and (b) percentage rents based upon tenants' gross sales which generally increase as prices rise. In addition, many of the Company's non-anchor leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits the Company to seek increases in rents upon renewal at then-current market rates if rents provided in the expiring leases are below then-existing market rates. Most of the Company's leases require tenants to pay a share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, thereby reducing the Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.\nLeverage Policies\nThe Company employs prudent amounts of leverage and uses debt as a"}
