MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report, including Item 1. Business,\u201d Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and our audited consolidated financial statements for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 and notes thereto included in this Annual Report.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and other factors described throughout this Annual Report and particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nIntroduction\nThe following discussion and analysis compares our and our subsidiaries' results of operations for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018. As a result of the Gracenote Sale in 2017 (as further described below), the historical results of operations for the businesses included in the Gracenote Sale are reported as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Accordingly, all references made to financial data in this Annual Report are to Tribune Media Company's continuing operations, unless specifically noted.\nOverview\nWe are a diversified media and entertainment company comprised of 42 local television stations, which we refer to as our television stations,\u201d that are either owned by us or owned by others, but to which we provide certain services, along with a national general entertainment cable network, a radio station, a portfolio of real estate assets and investments in a variety of media, websites and other related assets.\nAs further described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements, on December 19, 2016, we entered into the Gracenote SPA with Nielsen to sell our equity interest in substantially all of the Digital and Data business as part of the transaction, which was completed on January 31, 2017. Prior to the Gracenote Sale, we reported our operations through the Television and Entertainment and Digital and Data reportable segments. Our Digital and Data segment consisted of several businesses driven by our expertise in collection, creation and distribution of data and innovation in unique services and recognition technology that used data, including Gracenote Video, Gracenote Music and Gracenote Sports. In accordance with ASU 2014-08, the results of operations of Digital and Data businesses included in the Gracenote Sale are reported as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nOur business consists of our Television and Entertainment operations and the management of certain of our real estate assets. As of December 31, 2018, we also held a variety of investments, including an equity method investment in TV Food Network, which provides substantial annual cash distributions, and an investment in CEV LLC, which was sold on January 22, 2019. Prior to the sale of our ownership interest on September 13, 2018, we also held an equity investment in CareerBuilder.\nTelevision and Entertainment is a reportable segment which provides audiences across the country with news, entertainment and sports programming on Tribune Broadcasting local television stations and distinctive, high quality television series and movies on WGN America as well as news, entertainment and sports information via our websites and other digital assets. Television and Entertainment includes 42 local television stations and related websites, including 39 owned stations and 3 stations to which we provide certain services (the SSAs\u201d) with Dreamcatcher; WGN America, a national general entertainment cable network; Antenna TV and THIS TV, national multicast networks; and WGN-AM, a radio station in Chicago. The television stations, including the 3 stations owned by Dreamcatcher (a fully-consolidated VIE), are comprised of 14 FOX television affiliates; 12 CW television\naffiliates; 6 CBS television affiliates; 3 ABC television affiliates; 3 MY television affiliates; 2 NBC television affiliates; and 2 independent television stations.\nIn addition, we report and include under Corporate and Other the management of certain of our real estate assets, including revenues from leasing our owned office and production facilities and any gains or losses from the sales of our owned real estate, as well as certain administrative activities associated with operating corporate office functions.\nTelevision and Entertainment represented 99% of our consolidated operating revenues in 2018. Approximately 66% of these revenues came from the sale of advertising spots. Changes in advertising revenues are heavily correlated with and influenced by changes in the level of economic activity and the demand for political advertising spots in the United States. Changes in gross domestic product, consumer spending levels, auto sales, political advertising levels, programming content, audience share, and rates all impact demand for advertising on our television stations. Our advertising revenues are subject to changes in these factors both on a national level and on a local level in the markets in which we operate. Television and Entertainment operating revenues also included retransmission revenues and carriage fees, which represented approximately 24% and 8%, respectively, of Television and Entertainment's 2018 total operating revenues.\nSignificant expense categories for Television and Entertainment include compensation expense, programming expense, depreciation expense, amortization expense, primarily resulting from the adoption of fresh-start reporting on the Effective Date (as defined below), and other expenses. Compensation expense represented 36% of Television and Entertainment's 2018 total operating expenses before the gain on sales of spectrum and is impacted by many factors, including the number of full-time equivalent employees, changes in the design and costs of the various employee benefit plans, the level of pay increases and our actions to reduce staffing levels. Programming expense represented 32% of Television and Entertainment's 2018 total operating expenses before the gain on sales of spectrum. The level of programming expense is affected by the cost of programs available for purchase and the selection of programs aired by our television stations. Depreciation expense and amortization expense represented 3% and 11% of Television and Entertainment's 2018 total operating expenses, respectively, before the gain on sales of spectrum. Other expenses represented 18% of Television and Entertainment's 2018 total operating expenses before the gain on sales of spectrum and are principally for sales and marketing activities, occupancy costs and other station operating expenses.\nWe use operating revenues and operating profit as ways to measure the financial performance of our business segments. In addition, we use audience and revenue share for our television stations, together with other factors, to measure our Television and Entertainment market shares and performance.\nOur results of operations, when examined on a quarterly basis, reflect the historical seasonality of our advertising revenues. Typically, second and fourth quarter advertising revenues are higher than first and third quarter advertising revenues. Results for the second quarter usually reflect spring seasonal advertising, while the fourth quarter includes advertising related to the holiday season. In addition, our operating results are subject to fluctuations from political advertising as political spending is usually significantly higher in even numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections.\nSignificant Events\nNexstar Merger Agreement\nOn November 30, 2018, we entered into the Nexstar Merger Agreement, providing for the acquisition by Nexstar of all of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, by means of a merger of Nexstar Merger Sub with and into Tribune Media Company, with the Company surviving the Nexstar Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nexstar.\nIn the Nexstar Merger, each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Nexstar Merger (the Effective Time\u201d) (other than shares held by (i) any Tribune subsidiary, Nexstar or any Nexstar subsidiary or (ii) Tribune shareholders who have not voted in favor of adopting the Nexstar Merger\nAgreement and who have demanded and perfected (and not validly withdrawn or waived) their appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL) will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment of $46.50 in cash (the base merger consideration\u201d), plus, if the Nexstar Merger closes after August 31, 2019 (the Adjustment Date\u201d), an additional amount in cash equal to (a) (i) $0.009863 multiplied by (ii) the number of calendar days elapsed after Adjustment Date to and including the date on which the Nexstar Merger closes, minus (b) the amount of any dividends declared by us after the Adjustment Date with a record date prior to the date on which the Nexstar Merger closes, in each case, without interest and less any required withholding taxes (the additional per share consideration\u201d, and together with the base merger consideration, the Nexstar Merger Consideration\u201d). The additional per share consideration will not be less than zero.\nEach option to purchase shares of Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, for each share of Common Stock subject to such stock option, a cash payment equal to the excess, if any, of the value of the Nexstar Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such stock option, without any interest and subject to all applicable withholding. Any stock option that has an exercise price per share that is greater than or equal to the Nexstar Merger Consideration will be cancelled for no consideration or payment. Each award of restricted stock units outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, will immediately vest and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of the total number of shares of Common Stock underlying such restricted stock unit multiplied by the Nexstar Merger Consideration, without any interest and subject to all applicable withholding (the RSU Consideration\u201d), except that each award of restricted stock units granted to an employee on or after December 1, 2018 (other than restricted stock units required to be granted pursuant to employment agreements or offer letters) ( Annual Tribune RSUs\u201d) that has vested as of the Effective Time of the Nexstar Merger will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the RSU Consideration and any Annual Tribune RSUs that remain unvested as of the Effective Time of the Nexstar Merger will be cancelled for no consideration or payment. Each award of performance stock units outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, will immediately vest (with performance conditions for each open performance period as of the closing date deemed achieved at the applicable target\u201d level performance for such performance stock units) and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of the total number of shares of Common Stock underlying such performance stock units multiplied by the Nexstar Merger Consideration, without any interest and subject to all applicable withholding. Each outstanding award of deferred stock units outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of the total number of shares of Common Stock underlying such deferred stock units multiplied by the Nexstar Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to all applicable withholding. Each unexercised warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be assumed by Nexstar and converted into a warrant exercisable for the Nexstar Merger Consideration which the shares of Common Stock underlying such warrant would have been entitled to receive upon consummation of the Nexstar Merger and otherwise upon the same terms and conditions of such warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time.\nThe consummation of the Nexstar Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions, including, among others: (i) the adoption of the Nexstar Merger by holders of a majority of our outstanding Common Stock, (ii) the receipt of approval from the FCC and the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the Nexstar Merger under the HSR Act and (iii) the absence of any order or law of any governmental authority that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Nexstar Merger. Our and Nexstar's respective obligations to consummate the Nexstar Merger are also subject to certain additional customary conditions, including (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (generally subject to a material adverse effect\u201d standard), (ii) performance by the other party of its covenants in the Nexstar Merger Agreement in all material respects and (iii) with respect to Nexstar's obligation to consummate the Nexstar Merger, since the date of the Nexstar Merger Agreement, no material adverse effect with respect to Tribune having occurred.\nThe applications for FCC Approval were filed on January 7, 2019. On February 14, 2019, the FCC issued a public notice of filing of the applications which set deadlines for petitions to deny the applications, oppositions to petitions to deny and replies to oppositions to petitions to deny.\nOn February 7, 2019, we received a request for additional information and documentary material, often referred to as a second request,\u201d from the DOJ in connection with the Nexstar Merger Agreement. The second request was issued under the HSR Act. Nexstar received a substantively identical request for additional information and documentary material from the DOJ in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Nexstar Merger Agreement. Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Nexstar Merger Agreement is conditioned on expiration of the waiting period applicable under the HSR Act, among other conditions. Issuance of the second request extends the waiting period under the HSR Act until 30 days after Nexstar and the Company have substantially complied with the second request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the DOJ or the parties voluntarily extend the time for closing.\nThe Nexstar Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time: (i) by mutual written consent of Nexstar and us; (ii) by either Nexstar or us (a) if the Effective Time has not occurred on or before November 30, 2019, provided that (x) if, on the initial end date, any of the conditions to the consummation of the Nexstar Merger related to the HSR Approval or the FCC Approval have not been satisfied, but all other conditions the consummation of the Nexstar Merger have been satisfied or waived or capable of being satisfied, then the end date will be automatically extended to February 29, 2020 and (y) in the event the marketing period for the debt financing for the transaction has commenced but has not completed by the end date, the end date may be extended (or further extended) by Nexstar on one occasion in its sole discretion by providing written notice thereof to us at least one business day prior to the end date until the date that is four business days after the last scheduled expiration date of the marketing period (unless the failure of the Effective Time to occur before the end date was primarily due to such party's breach of any of its obligations under the Nexstar Merger Agreement), (b) if any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction has issued an order permanently prohibiting the consummation of the Nexstar Merger and such order has become final and non-appealable (unless such order was primarily attributable to such party's breach of the Nexstar Merger Agreement), or (c) if, after completion of the special meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof), our shareholders have not approved the adoption of the Nexstar Merger Agreement; and (iii) either Nexstar or us in certain circumstances, as described in the Nexstar Merger Agreement.\nWe must pay Nexstar a termination fee of $135 million if Nexstar terminates the Nexstar Merger Agreement due to (a) our board or any committee thereof (i) withdrawing, rescinding, amending, changing, modifying or qualifying, or otherwise proposing publicly to take any of the foregoing actions in a manner adverse to Nexstar, its recommendation that our shareholders adopt the Nexstar Merger Agreement, (ii) failing to make such recommendation in our proxy statement, (iii) adopting, approving or recommending, or otherwise proposing publicly to adopt, approve or recommend, an alternative acquisition proposal, (iv) failing to publicly recommend against an alternative acquisition proposal that has been publicly disclosed within ten business days of Nexstar's request and failing to reaffirm its recommendation within such period upon such request (provided that such a request may be delivered by Nexstar only once with respect to each alternative acquisition proposal, with the right to make an additional request with respect to each subsequent material amendment or modification thereto), or (v) taking any action to make the provisions of any fair price,\u201d moratorium,\u201d control share acquisition,\u201d business combination\u201d or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation inapplicable to any transaction other than the transactions contemplated by the Nexstar Merger Agreement; (b) we or any of our subsidiaries having entered into any agreement, other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement, with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal; or (c) we terminate the Nexstar Merger Agreement due to our board authorizing us to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement.\nAs further described in the Nexstar Merger Agreement, we must pay Nexstar a termination fee of $135 million (except that the termination fee of $135 million will be reduced by any previously paid amounts relating to the documented, out-of-pocket expenses of Nexstar in an amount not to exceed $15 million) if: (a) we or Nexstar terminate the Nexstar Merger Agreement if the Effective Time has not occurred prior to the end date of November 30, 2019, subject to an automatic extension to February 29, 2020 in certain circumstances if the only outstanding\nunfulfilled conditions relate to HSR Approval or FCC Approval (and an additional extension, at Nexstar's election, if the marketing period for the debt financing for the transaction has not ended by the end date); (b) we or Nexstar terminate the Nexstar Merger Agreement if, after completion of the special meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof), our shareholders have not approved the adoption of the Nexstar Merger Agreement; or (c) Nexstar terminates the Nexstar Merger Agreement in respect of a willful breach of our covenants or agreements that would give rise to the failure of a closing condition that is incapable of being cured within a specified time period, and, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses, an alternative acquisition proposal has been made to us and publicly announced or otherwise disclosed and has not been withdrawn prior to the termination of the Nexstar Merger Agreement, the date of the special meeting (in the case of a termination for failure to obtain approval of the adoption of the Nexstar Merger Agreement by our shareholders) or the date of the applicable breach giving rise to termination, as applicable, and within twelve months after termination of the Nexstar Merger Agreement, we enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal (and subsequently consummates such transaction) or consummates a transaction with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal.\nWe must pay Nexstar the documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Nexstar in an amount not to exceed $15 million if we or Nexstar terminate the Nexstar Merger Agreement because our shareholders do not approve the transaction.\nTermination of Sinclair Merger Agreement\nOn May 8, 2017, we entered into the Sinclair Merger Agreement with Sinclair, providing for the acquisition by Sinclair of all of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock by means of a merger of Samson Merger Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Sinclair, with and into Tribune Media Company, with Tribune Media Company surviving the Sinclair Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Sinclair.\nThe consummation of the Sinclair Merger was subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain important conditions, including, among others: the receipt of approval from the FCC and the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the Sinclair Merger under the HSR Act. Pursuant to the Sinclair Merger Agreement, we had the right to terminate the Sinclair Merger Agreement if Sinclair failed to perform in all material respects its covenants, and such failure was not cured by the end date of August 8, 2018. Additionally, either party could terminate the Sinclair Merger Agreement if the Sinclair Merger was not consummated on or before August 8, 2018 (and the failure for the Sinclair Merger to have been consummated by such date was not primarily due to a breach of the Sinclair Merger Agreement by the party terminating the Sinclair Merger Agreement). On August 9, 2018, we provided notification to Sinclair that we had terminated the Sinclair Merger Agreement, effective immediately, on the basis of Sinclair's willful and material breaches of its covenants and the expiration of the end date thereunder. Additionally, on August 9, 2018, we filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Sinclair (the Complaint\u201d), alleging that Sinclair willfully and materially breached its obligations under the Sinclair Merger Agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain regulatory approval of the Sinclair Merger so as to enable the Sinclair Merger to close as soon as reasonably practicable. The lawsuit seeks damages for all losses incurred as a result of Sinclair's breach of contract under the Sinclair Merger Agreement. On August 29, 2018, Sinclair filed an answer to our Complaint and a counterclaim (the Counterclaim\u201d). The Counterclaim alleges that we materially and willfully breached the Sinclair Merger Agreement by failing to use reasonable best efforts to obtain regulatory approval of the Sinclair Merger. On September 18, 2018, we filed an answer to the Counterclaim. We believe the Counterclaim is without merit and intend to defend it vigorously.\nOn May 8, 2018, we, Sinclair Television Group, Inc. ( Sinclair Television\u201d) and Fox Television Stations, LLC ( Fox\u201d) entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Fox Purchase Agreement\u201d) to sell the assets of seven network affiliates for $910 million in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments. The network affiliates subject to the Fox Purchase Agreement were: KCPQ (Tacoma, WA); KDVR (Denver, CO); KSTU (Salt Lake City, UT); KSWB-TV (San Diego, CA); KTXL (Sacramento, CA); WJW (Cleveland, OH); and WSFL-TV (Miami, FL). In connection with the termination of the Sinclair Merger Agreement on August 9, 2018, we provided notification to Fox that we terminated the Fox Purchase Agreement, effective immediately. Under the terms of the Fox Purchase Agreement, no termination fees were payable by any party.\nTax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Reform\u201d) was signed into law. Under ASC Topic 740, the effects of Tax Reform are recognized in the period of enactment and as such were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Consistent with the guidance under ASC Topic 740, and subject to Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB\u201d) 118, which provides for a measurement period to complete the accounting for certain elements of Tax Reform, we recorded the provisional impact from the enactment of Tax Reform in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result of Tax Reform, we recorded a provisional discrete net tax benefit of $256 million, primarily due to a remeasurement of the net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In 2018, we completed the accounting for income tax effects of Tax Reform and recorded an additional income tax benefit of $24 million to the net deferred tax liabilities, primarily resulting from return to provision adjustments which have the effect of adjusting the provisional discrete net tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. The tax benefit was recorded as the result of new information, including higher than expected pension contributions and new filing positions reported in the Company's income tax returns as they became due. While we consider the income tax accounting related to Tax Reform to be complete, we continue to evaluate new guidance and tax legislation as it is issued. Tax Reform also provided for a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) through the year ended December 31, 2017. We do not have any net accumulated E&P in our foreign subsidiaries and therefore are not subject to tax for the year ended December 31, 2017. Further, we have analyzed the effects of new taxes due on certain foreign income, such as global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d), base-erosion anti-abuse tax ( BEAT\u201d), foreign-derived intangible income ( FDII\u201d) and limitations on interest expense deductions (if certain conditions apply) that are effective starting in fiscal 2018. We have determined that these new provisions are not applicable to us.\nMonetization of Real Estate Assets\nIn the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, we sold several properties for net pretax proceeds totaling $59 million, $144 million and $506 million, respectively, and recognized a net pretax gain of $25 million, $29 million and $213 million, respectively. We define net proceeds as pretax cash proceeds on the sale of properties, net of associated selling costs. See Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements for details on real estate sales for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018.\nFCC Spectrum Auction\nOn April 13, 2017, the FCC announced the conclusion of the incentive auction, the results of the reverse and forward auction and the repacking of broadcast television spectrum. We participated in the auction and have received approximately $191 million in pretax proceeds (including $26 million of proceeds received by a Dreamcatcher station) as of December 31, 2017. The proceeds reflect the FCC's acceptance of one or more bids placed by us or channel share partners of television stations owned or operated by us during the auction to modify and/or surrender spectrum used by certain of such bidder's television stations. We used $102 million of after-tax proceeds to prepay a portion of our Term Loan Facility. After-tax proceeds of $12.6 million received by a Dreamcatcher station were used to prepay a substantial portion of the Dreamcatcher Credit Facility. FCC licenses with a carrying value of $39 million were included in assets held for sale as of December 31, 2017. In 2017, we received $172 million in gross pretax proceeds for these licenses as part of the FCC spectrum auction, and in the\nfirst quarter of 2018, we recognized a net pretax gain of $133 million related to the surrender of the spectrum of these television stations in January 2018. In 2017, we also received $84 million of pretax proceeds for sharing arrangements whereby we will provide hosting services to the counterparties. Additionally, we paid $66 million of proceeds in 2017 to counterparties who will host certain of our television stations under sharing arrangements.\nTwenty-two of our television stations (including WTTK, which operates as a satellite station of WTTV) are required to change frequencies or otherwise modify their operations as a result of the repacking, as further described in Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements. In doing so, the stations could incur substantial conversion costs, reduction or loss of over-the-air signal coverage or an inability to provide high definition programming and additional program streams. The legislation authorizing the incentive auction provides the FCC with a $1.750 billion special fund to reimburse reasonable capital costs and expenses incurred by stations that are reassigned to new channels in the repacking, which amount was increased by $1 billion pursuant to the adoption of an amended version of the Repack Airwaves Yielding Better Access for Users of Modern Services (RAY BAUM'S) Act of 2018 by the U.S. Congress on March 23, 2018. A majority of our capital expenditures for the FCC spectrum repacking occurred in 2018 and are expected to occur in 2019. Through December 31, 2018, we incurred $27 million in capital expenditures for the spectrum repack, of which $24 million were incurred in 2018. We received FCC reimbursements of $11 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The reimbursements are included as a reduction to SG&A expense in our audited Consolidated Statement of Operations and are presented as an investing inflow in our audited Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We expect that the reimbursements from the FCC's special fund will cover the majority of our capital costs and expenses related to the repacking. However, we cannot currently predict the effect of the repacking, whether the special fund will be sufficient to reimburse all of our expenses related to the repacking, the timing of reimbursements or any spectrum-related FCC regulatory action.\nChapter 11 Reorganization\nOn December 8, 2008 (the Petition Date\u201d) the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief (collectively, the Chapter 11 Petitions\u201d) under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. As further defined and described in Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements, a plan of reorganization for the Debtors became effective and the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11 on December 31, 2012. The Bankruptcy Court has entered final decrees that have collectively closed 106 of the Debtors' Chapter 11 cases. The remaining Debtors' Chapter 11 proceedings continue to be jointly administered under the caption In re: Tribune Media Company, et al., Case No.08-13141.\nFrom the Petition Date and until the Effective Date, the Debtors operated their businesses as debtors-in-possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and applicable orders of the Bankruptcy Court. In general, as debtors-in-possession, the Debtors were authorized under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to continue to operate as ongoing businesses, but could not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court.\nOn the Effective Date, all of the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied or waived, the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11, and the settlements, agreements and transactions contemplated by the Plan to be effected on the Effective Date were implemented, including, among other things, the appointment of a new board of directors and the initiation of distributions to creditors. As a result, our ownership changed from the ESOP to certain of our creditors on the Effective Date. On January 17, 2013, our Board of Directors appointed a chairman of the board and a new chief executive officer. Such appointments were effective immediately.\nSince the Effective Date, we have substantially consummated the various transactions contemplated under the Plan. In particular, we have made all distributions of cash, Common Stock and Warrants that were required to be made under the terms of the Plan to creditors holding allowed claims as of December 31, 2012. Claims of general unsecured creditors that become allowed claims on or after the Effective Date have been or will be paid on the next quarterly distribution date after such allowance. At December 31, 2018, restricted cash and cash equivalents held by us to satisfy the remaining claims obligations was $17 million and is estimated to be sufficient to satisfy such\nobligations. If the aggregate allowed amount of the remaining claims exceeds the restricted cash and cash equivalents held for satisfying such claims, we will be required to satisfy the allowed claims from our cash on hand from operations. See Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Chapter 11 proceedings.\nChicago Cubs Transactions\nAs further described in Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements, we consummated the closing of the Chicago Cubs Transactions on October 27, 2009. As a result of these transactions, NEH owned 95% and we owned 5% of the membership interests in CEV LLC. The fair market value of the contributed assets exceeded the tax basis and did not result in an immediate taxable gain because the transaction was structured to comply with the partnership provisions of the IRC and related regulations. On June 28, 2016, the IRS issued to us a Notice of Deficiency ( Notice\u201d) which presents the IRS's position that the gain should have been included in our 2009 taxable income. Accordingly, the IRS has proposed a $182 million tax and a $73 million gross valuation misstatement penalty. In addition, after-tax interest on the aforementioned proposed tax and penalty through December 31, 2018 would be approximately $81 million. We continue to disagree with the IRS's position that the transaction generated a taxable gain in 2009, the proposed penalty and the IRS's calculation of the gain. During the third quarter of 2016, we filed a petition in U.S. Tax Court to contest the IRS's determination. We continue to pursue resolution of this disputed tax matter with the IRS. If the IRS prevails in their position, the gain on the Chicago Cubs Transactions would be deemed to be taxable in 2009. We estimate that the federal and state income taxes would be approximately $225 million before interest and penalties. Any tax, interest and penalty due will be offset by tax payments made relating to this transaction subsequent to 2009. As of December 31, 2018, we have paid or accrued approximately $80 million of federal and state tax payments through our regular tax reporting process. We do not maintain any tax reserves relating to the Chicago Cubs Transactions. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 include a deferred tax liability of $69 million and $96 million, respectively, related to the future recognition of taxable income related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions.\nOn August 21, 2018, NEH provided the Call Notice to us that NEH was exercising its right to purchase our 5% membership interest in CEV LLC. We sold our 5% ownership interest in CEV LLC on January 22, 2019 and received pretax proceeds of $107.5 million. We expect to recognize a pretax gain of $86 million in the first quarter of 2019. As a result of the sale, the total remaining deferred tax liability of $69 million will become currently payable in 2019. The sale of our ownership interest in CEV LLC has no impact on our dispute with the IRS.\nEmployee Reductions\nWe recorded pretax charges, mainly consisting of employee severance costs, associated termination benefits and related expenses totaling $7 million, $5 million and $10 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These charges are included in direct operating expenses or SG&A expense, as appropriate, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table summarizes these severance and related charges included in income from continuing operations by business segment (in thousands):\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Television and Entertainment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>(398\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe accrued liability for severance and related expenses was $7 million and $5 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nNon-Operating Items\nNon-operating items were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishments and modification of debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20,487\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) gain on investment transactions, net\n</td> <td>(1,113\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Write-downs of investments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(193,494\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-operating gain, net\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-operating (loss) gain, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,045\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(205,779\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-operating items for 2018 included a pretax loss of $5 million from the sale of our remaining ownership interest in CareerBuilder and a pretax gain of $4 million from the sale of one of our other equity investments.\nNon-operating items for 2017 included a $20 million pretax loss on the extinguishments and modification of debt. The loss included a write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $7 million and an unamortized discount of $2 million as a portion of the Term Loan Facility was considered extinguished for accounting purposes as well as an expense of $12 million of third party fees as a portion of the Term Loan Facility was considered a modification transaction under ASC 470, Debt.\u201d (Loss) gain on investment transactions, net included a pretax gain of $5 million from the sale of our Tribune Publishing shares and a pretax gain of $4 million from the partial sale of CareerBuilder. Write-downs of investments included non-cash pretax impairment charges of $193 million to write down our investments in CareerBuilder and Dose Media, LLC ( Dose Media\u201d) and one of our other equity investments (as further described in Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements).\nNon-operating items for 2016 included a $5 million non-cash favorable workers' compensation reserve adjustment related to businesses divested by us in prior years.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion of our annual results of operations only relates to our continuing operations, unless otherwise noted.\nAs described previously, on December 19, 2016, we entered into the Gracenote SPA with Nielsen to sell our equity interest in substantially all of the Digital and Data business. As a result, the historical results of operations for the businesses included in the Gracenote Sale are reported in discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Television and Entertainment reportable segment includes the operations of Covers, a sports betting information website, which was previously included in the Digital and Data reportable segment. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation; the impact of this reclassification was immaterial.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( Topic 606\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2014-09 created Topic 606 and superseded the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.\u201d We adopted the new revenue guidance in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of December 31, 2017. Results for reporting periods prior to adoption continue to be presented in accordance with our historical accounting under Topic 605. The only identified impact to our financial statements relates to barter revenue and expense as well as barter-related broadcast rights and contracts payable for broadcast rights, which are no longer recognized.\nFor the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2018\nCONSOLIDATED\nConsolidated operating results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are shown in the table below (in thousands).\nTable 136:

million, in 2018 primarily due to an increase of $163 million in Television and Entertainment revenues driven by higher advertising revenue, retransmission revenues and carriage fees, partially offset by the absence of barter revenue due to the new revenue guidance adopted in 2018. Consolidated operating profit was $488 million in 2018 compared to $86 million in 2017, representing an increase of $403 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher Television and Entertainment operating profit largely due to a net pretax gain of $133 million related to licenses sold in the FCC spectrum auction, an increase in revenue and lower programming expenses as well as a lower Corporate and Other operating loss primarily due to a decrease in compensation, other expenses and depreciation. Programming expenses included a program impairment charge of $28 million for the syndicated program Elementary at WGN America in 2018 compared to a program impairment charge of $80 million in 2017 for the syndicated programs Elementary and Person of Interest at WGN America.\n2017 compared to 2016\nConsolidated operating revenues decreased 5%, or $99 million, in 2017 primarily due to a decrease of $74 million in Television and Entertainment revenues driven by lower advertising and other revenue, partially offset by higher retransmission revenue and carriage fees. Additionally, Corporate and Other revenues declined by $24 million primarily due to the loss of revenue from real estate properties sold in 2016 and 2017. Consolidated operating profit was $86 million in 2017 compared to $409 million in 2016, representing a decrease of $323 million primarily due to a $185 million decline in gains recorded on the sales of real estate from $213 million in 2016 to $29 million in 2017 and lower Television and Entertainment operating profit. Television and Entertainment operating profit decreased due to lower revenues and higher programming expenses partly resulting from a $43 million increase in program impairment charges. Programming expenses included a program impairment charge of $80 million for the syndicated programs Elementary and Person of Interest at WGN America in 2017 compared to a program impairment charge of $37 million in 2016 for the syndicated program Elementary at WGN America.\nOperating Expenses-Consolidated operating expenses were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18-17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17-16\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Programming\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>489,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>604,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>515,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-19\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+17\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>401,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>390,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>567,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>620,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>54,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization\n</td> <td>166,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of spectrum\n</td> <td>(133,197\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of real estate, net\n</td> <td>(24,657\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,533\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(213,086\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-87\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,521,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,763,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,539,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Represents positive or negative change in excess of 100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table> 2018 compared to 2017\nProgramming expenses, which represented 24% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 33% for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased 19%, or $115 million, due largely to the $51 million decrease in program impairment charges described above as well as lower amortization of license fees, the absence of barter expense in 2018 and a total of $19 million of additional expense in 2017 related to a shift in programming strategy at WGN America in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher network affiliate fees. The decrease in amortization of license fees of $73 million was primarily attributable to three originals airing in the first half of 2017 (Outsiders, Underground and Salem) versus airing lower cost programming in 2018. Barter expense decreased $28 million as we no longer recognize barter revenue and expense as a result of adopting new revenue guidance in 2018. Network affiliate fees increased by $59 million mainly due to the renewal of network affiliation agreements in eight markets with FOX during the third quarter of 2018, along with other contractual increases.\nDirect operating expenses, which represented 20% of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 21% for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased 2%, or $10 million, due mainly to increases in compensation and outside services expense. Compensation expense increased $5 million due to higher direct pay and benefits. Outside services expense increased $4 million primarily due to costs associated with spectrum sharing arrangements and costs for operating websites.\nSG&A expenses, which represented 28% of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 31% for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased 1%, or $5 million, primarily due to lower compensation and other expenses, partially offset by an increase in outside services expense. Compensation expense decreased 1%, or $4\nmillion, due to a $13 million decline at Corporate and Other, partially offset by a $10 million increase at Television & Entertainment. The decline at Corporate and Other was primarily due to the prior year expense of $13 million ($6 million of severance and $7 million of stock-based compensation) related to the resignation of the CEO in the first quarter of 2017. In addition, direct pay and benefits decreased by $1 million and severance decreased by $1 million, offset by a $2 million increase in retention bonuses ($9 million in 2018 compared to $7 million in 2017). Compensation expense increased $10 million at Television & Entertainment due to a $9 million increase in incentive compensation, a $4 million increase in retention bonuses ($5 million in 2018 compared to $1 million in 2017) and a $3 million increase in severance, partially offset by a $6 million decrease in direct pay and benefits and a $1 million decrease in stock-based compensation. Other expenses decreased 2%, or $4 million, as the receipt of $11 million of spectrum repack reimbursements, a $2 million decrease in rent expense and a $1 million decrease in promotion expense were partially offset by a $5 million increase in outside national sales representative commissions, $4 million of costs related to a litigation reserve and a non-cash impairment charge of $3 million related to the impairment of an FCC license at one of our television stations in 2018. Outside services expense increased 2%, or $2 million, driven by higher professional and legal fees.\nGain on sales of real estate, net of $25 million for 2018 related to the sales of our properties in Melville, NY and Hartford, CT, as further described in Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation expense fell 4%, or $2 million, in 2018. Amortization expense remained flat in 2018.\nGain on sales of spectrum of $133 million for 2018 relates to licenses sold in the FCC spectrum auction for which the spectrum of these television stations was surrendered in January 2018, as further described in Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\n2017 compared to 2016\nProgramming expenses, which represented 33% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 26% for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased 17%, or $88 million, due largely to a $43 million increase in program impairment charges and a total of $19 million of expense related to the shift in programming strategy at WGN America in the second quarter of 2017. This included cancellation costs for Outsiders and Underground and the associated accelerated amortization of remaining programming assets for both shows as well as the write-off of certain other capitalized program development projects. The remaining increase was due to higher network affiliate fees of $27 million and $7 million of higher amortization of license fees primarily related to airing higher cost feature presentations on WGN America.\nDirect operating expenses, which represented 21% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 20% for the year ended December 31, 2016, were essentially flat as a $2 million increase in compensation expense at Television and Entertainment was mostly offset by declines in other direct operating expenses.\nSG&A expenses, which represented 31% of revenues for year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 32% for the year ended December 31, 2016, decreased 8%, or $47 million, due mainly to lower other expenses and outside services expense. Outside services expense decreased 6%, or $5 million, driven by a $12 million decrease in professional fees primarily related to technology, a $3 million decrease in costs for operating websites and a $3 million decrease in costs associated with real estate sold in 2016, partially offset by a $14 million increase in professional and legal fees primarily associated with the terminated Sinclair Merger. Other expenses decreased 16%, or $39 million, primarily due to a $9 million decline in promotion expense, a $13 million decline in real estate impairment charges, a $5 million decline in outside national sales representative commissions, a $2 million decrease in bad debt write-offs, and a $9 million decrease in real estate taxes and other costs associated with real estate sold in 2016. Additionally, 2016 included non-cash impairment charges of $3 million related to the impairment of FCC licenses at two of our television stations.\nGain on sales of real estate, net of $29 million for 2017 primarily related to the sales of our properties in Costa Mesa, CA and Ft. Lauderdale, FL.\nDepreciation expense fell 4%, or $3 million, in 2017. The decrease is primarily due to lower levels of depreciable property. Amortization expense remained flat in 2017.\nIncome (Loss) From Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes-The results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 include the operating results of the Digital and Data businesses included in the Gracenote Sale. Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes in 2017 totaled $14 million, including a pretax gain on the sale of $33 million, compared to a loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in 2016 of $73 million. Interest expense allocated to discontinued operations totaled $1 million and $15 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.

For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, barter revenue totaled $28 million and $30 million, respectively. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method.\n2018 compared to 2017\nTelevision and Entertainment operating revenues increased 9%, or $163 million, in 2018 largely due to increases in advertising revenues, retransmission revenues, carriage fees and other revenue partially offset by the absence of barter revenue, as further described below.\nTelevision and Entertainment operating profit increased $387 million to $583 million in 2018 compared to $196 million in 2017. The increase was due primarily to a $163 million increase in operating revenues, a net pretax gain of $133 million in 2018 related to licenses sold in the FCC spectrum auction and a $115 million decrease in programming expenses, partially offset by higher compensation expense and other expense, as further described below.\n2017 compared to 2016\nTelevision and Entertainment operating revenues decreased 4%, or $74 million, in 2017 due largely to a decrease in advertising and other revenue, partially offset by an increase in retransmission revenues and carriage fees, as further described below.\nTelevision and Entertainment operating profit decreased $129 million to $196 million in 2017 compared to $325 million in 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a $74 million decline in operating revenues and an $88 million increase in programming expenses, mainly from a $43 million increase in program impairment charges, higher network affiliate fees and additional expense related to the shift in programming strategy at WGN America, partially offset by a $26 million decrease in other expenses and a $6 million decrease in compensation expense, as further described below.\nOperating Revenues-Television and Entertainment operating revenues, by classification, were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18-17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17-16\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,315,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,225,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,374,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retransmission revenues\n</td> <td>471,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>412,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Carriage fees\n</td> <td>161,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+26\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Barter/trade\n</td> <td>9,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-76\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>40,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+28\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-21\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,998,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,835,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,909,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 compared to 2017\nAdvertising Revenues-Advertising revenues, net of agency commissions, grew 7%, or $90 million, in 2018 primarily due to a $150 million increase in political advertising revenues that was partially offset by a $62 million decrease in core advertising revenues (comprised of local and national advertising, excluding political and digital). The decrease in core advertising revenue was primarily due to a reduction in inventory available for local and national spots due to political advertising, a decline in television advertising in certain of our markets, a decrease in revenues associated with airing the Super Bowl on 2 NBC-affiliated stations in 2018 compared to 14 FOX-affiliated stations in 2017 and the 2018 Winter Olympics, which negatively impacted the non-NBC affiliated stations' advertising revenues. Political advertising revenues, which are a component of total advertising revenues, were $172 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $22 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, as 2018 was an election year.\nRetransmission Revenues-Retransmission revenues increased 14%, or $59 million, in 2018 primarily due to a $74 million increase from higher rates included in retransmission consent renewals of our MVPD agreements, partially offset by a decrease in the number of subscribers.\nCarriage Fees-Carriage fees increased 26%, or $33 million, in 2018 primarily due to higher rates for the distribution of WGN America.\nBarter/Trade Revenues-Barter/trade revenues decreased 76%, or $28 million, in 2018 as barter revenues are no longer recognized under the new revenue guidance adopted in 2018. We recognized $28 million of barter revenue in 2017.\nOther Revenues-Other revenues are primarily derived from profit sharing, revenue on syndicated content and copyright royalties. Other revenues increased 28%, or $9 million, in 2018 mainly due to a $4 million increase in copyright royalties, $3 million of revenue for the broadcast of third party digital multicast network programming and $3 million of deferred revenue recognized related to spectrum sharing arrangements.\n2017 compared to 2016\nAdvertising Revenues-Advertising revenues, net of agency commissions, decreased 11%, or $149 million, in 2017 primarily due to a $115 million decrease in political advertising revenues and a $36 million decrease in core advertising revenues (comprised of local and national advertising, excluding political and digital), partially offset by a $2 million increase in digital revenues. The decrease in core advertising revenue was primarily due to a decline in market revenues, partially offset by an increase in revenues associated with airing the Super Bowl on 14 FOX-affiliated stations in 2017 compared to 6 CBS-affiliated stations in 2016. Political advertising revenues, which are a component of total advertising revenues, were $22 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $137 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 as 2016 was a presidential election year.\nRetransmission Revenues-Retransmission revenues increased 23%, or $78 million, in 2017 primarily due to a $76 million increase from higher rates included in retransmission consent renewals of our MVPD agreements, partially offset by a decrease in the number of subscribers. Additionally, 2016 was negatively impacted due to the blackout of our stations by DISH network from June 12, 2016 to September 3, 2016.\nCarriage Fees-Carriage fees increased 6%, or $7 million, in 2017 due mainly to a $9 million increase from higher rates for the distribution of WGN America, partially offset by a decline in the number of subscribers.\nBarter/Trade Revenues-Barter/trade revenues decreased 4%, or $2 million, in 2017.\nOther Revenues-Other revenues are primarily derived from profit sharing, revenue on syndicated content and copyright royalties. Other revenues decreased 21%, or $9 million, in 2017 due primarily to 2016 including profit sharing from original programming that was cancelled.\nOperating Expenses-Television and Entertainment operating expenses for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18-17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17-16\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>558,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>544,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>550,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Programming\n</td> <td>489,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>604,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>515,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-19\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+17\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>44,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization\n</td> <td>166,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>289,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>281,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>307,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of spectrum\n</td> <td>(133,197\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,415,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,639,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,585,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Represents positive or negative change in excess of 100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table> 2018 compared to 2017\nTelevision and Entertainment operating expenses decreased 14%, or $224 million, in 2018 largely due to a net pretax gain of $133 million in 2018 related to licenses sold in the FCC spectrum auction and a $115 million decline in programming expense, partially offset by increases in compensation expense and other expense, as further described below.\nCompensation Expense-Compensation expense, which is included in both direct operating expenses and SG&A expense, increased 3%, or $14 million, in 2018 due to a $4 million increase in retention bonuses ($5 million in 2018 compared to $1 million in 2017), a $9 million increase in incentive compensation and a $3 million increase in severance expense, partially offset by decreases in direct pay and benefits and stock-based compensation.\nProgramming Expense-Programming expense decreased 19%, or $115 million, in 2018 due primarily to the decrease of $51 million in program impairment charges described above as well as lower amortization of license fees, the absence of barter expense in 2018 and the $19 million of additional expense in 2017 related to the shift in programming strategy at WGN America, partially offset by higher network affiliate fees. The decrease in amortization of license fees of $73 million was primarily attributable to three originals airing in the first half of 2017 (Outsiders, Underground and Salem) versus airing lower cost programming in 2018. Barter expense decreased $28 million as we no longer recognize barter revenue and expense as a result of adopting new revenue guidance in 2018. Network affiliate fees increased by $59 million mainly due to the renewal of network affiliation agreements in eight markets with FOX during the third quarter of 2018, along with other contractual increases.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense-Depreciation expense increased 5%, or $2 million, in 2018. Amortization expense remained flat in 2018.\nOther Expenses-Other expenses include sales and marketing, occupancy, outside services and other miscellaneous expenses, which are included in direct operating expenses or SG&A expense, as applicable. Other expenses increased 3%, or $8 million, in 2018. The increase was due primarily to a $5 million increase in outside national sales representative commissions, a $6 million increase in outside services expense driven by increases in costs associated with spectrum sharing arrangements and costs for operating websites, $4 million of costs related to a litigation reserve and a non-cash impairment charge of $3 million related to the impairment of an FCC license at one of our television stations in 2018. The increase was partially offset by $11 million of spectrum repack reimbursements.\nGain on Sales of Spectrum-In 2018, we recorded a net pretax gain of $133 million related to the licenses sold in the FCC spectrum auction for which the spectrum of these television stations was surrendered in January 2018, as further described in Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\n2017 compared to 2016\nTelevision and Entertainment operating expenses increased 3%, or $54 million, in 2017 largely due to higher programming expense, partially offset by lower other expenses and a decline in compensation expense, as further described below.\nCompensation Expense-Compensation expense, which is included in both direct operating expenses and SG&A expense, decreased 1%, or $6 million, in 2017 primarily due to a $5 million decrease in severance expense and a $3 million decrease in incentive compensation, partially offset by a $2 million increase in stock-based compensation. Severance expense was $4 million in 2017 compared to $9 million in 2016.\nProgramming Expense-Programming expense increased 17%, or $88 million, in 2017 due primarily to the increase of $43 million in program impairment charges and $19 million of additional expenses related to the shift in programming strategy at WGN America, higher network affiliate fees and higher amortization of license fees. Network affiliate fees increased by $27 million mainly due to renewals of certain network affiliate agreements in the third quarter of 2016 as well as other contractual increases. The increase in amortization of license fees of $7 million was primarily attributable to airing higher cost feature presentations on WGN America.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense-Depreciation expense decreased 5%, or $2 million, in 2017 due to lower levels of depreciable property. Amortization expense remained flat in 2017.\nOther Expenses-Other expenses include sales and marketing, occupancy, outside services and other miscellaneous expenses, which are included in direct operating expenses or SG&A expense, as applicable. Other expenses decreased 8%, or $26 million, in 2017. The decrease was due primarily to a $9 million decline in promotion expense, a $5 million decline in outside national sales commissions, a $3 million decrease due to impairment charges recorded in 2016 associated with one real estate property, a $3 million decrease in outside services primarily related to professional fees and costs for operating websites, a $2 million decrease in bad debt write-offs and 2016 included impairment charges of $3 million related to the impairment of FCC licenses at two of our television stations.\nCORPORATE AND OTHER\nOperating Revenues and Expenses-Corporate and Other operating revenues and expenses for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18-17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17-16\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-64\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-66\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate (2)\n</td> <td>120,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of real estate\n</td> <td>(24,657\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,216\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(213,083\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-87\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45,901\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Represents positive or negative change in excess of 100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Real estate operating expenses included $1 million, $2 million and $2 million of depreciation expense in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Corporate operating expenses included $8 million, $12 million and $11 million of depreciation expense in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> 2018 compared to 2017\nReal Estate Revenues-Real estate revenues decreased 18%, or $2 million, in 2018 primarily due to the loss of revenue from real estate properties sold during 2017 and 2018.\nReal Estate Expenses-Real estate operating expenses decreased 11%, or $1 million, in 2018 primarily resulting from the absence of impairment charges in 2018 compared to $2 million of impairment charges recorded in 2017 associated with certain real estate properties.\nCorporate Expenses-Corporate expenses decreased 15%, or $20 million, in 2018 primarily due to lower compensation expense, other expenses and depreciation. Compensation expense decreased $13 million as the prior year included $13 million of expense ($6 million of severance and $7 million of stock-based compensation expense) related to the resignation of the CEO in the first quarter of 2017. In addition, direct pay and benefits decreased by $1 million and severance decreased by $1 million, offset by a $2 million increase in retention bonuses ($9 million in 2018 compared to $6 million in 2017). Additionally, depreciation expense decreased by $3 million and other expense decreased by $4 million largely due to a decline in rent expense.\nGain on Sales of Real Estate-In 2018, we recorded net pretax gains of $25 million related to the sales of our real estate properties in Melville, NY and Hartford, CT, as further described in Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\n2017 compared to 2016\nReal Estate Revenues-Real estate revenues decreased 64%, or $24 million, in 2017 primarily due to the loss of revenue from real estate properties sold during 2016 and 2017.\nReal Estate Expenses-Real estate operating expenses decreased 66%, or $23 million, in 2017 primarily resulting from a $12 million decrease in real estate taxes and other costs associated with real estate sold in 2016 as well as a $9 million reduction of impairment charges associated with certain real estate properties from $12 million in 2016 to $2 million in 2017.\nCorporate Expenses-Corporate expenses increased 6%, or $8 million, in 2017 primarily due to a $5 million increase in compensation expense as a result of $6 million of severance expense related to the resignation of the CEO in the first quarter of 2017, a $5 million increase in transaction related bonuses, and a $2 million increase in outside services, partially offset by a $4 million decrease in equity compensation and a $2 million decrease in other compensation. The $2 million increase in outside services was driven by a $14 million increase in professional and legal fees primarily associated with the Sinclair Merger Agreement that was terminated on August 9, 2018, partially offset by a $12 million decrease in professional fees primarily related to technology.\nGain on Sales of Real Estate-In 2017, we recorded net pretax gains of $28 million primarily related to the sales of our real estate properties in Costa Mesa, CA and Ft. Lauderdale, FL, as further described in Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nINCOME ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET\nIncome on equity investments, net from continuing operations was as follows (in thousands):\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18-17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17-16\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from equity investments, net, before amortization of basis difference\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>202,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of basis difference (1)\n</td> <td>(49,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53,502\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54,602\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from equity investments, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>See Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the discussion of the amortization of basis difference.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome on equity investments, net increased 23%, or $32 million, in 2018 due to higher equity income from TV Food Network and CareerBuilder. The increase in the equity income of TV Food Network was due to higher reported net income. The increase in the equity income of CareerBuilder was largely due to the absence of non-recurring transaction expenses incurred by CareerBuilder in 2017 related to the CareerBuilder sale on July 31, 2017, as further described in Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements, along with recognizing our share of the gain on the sale of one of CareerBuilder's business operations on May 14, 2018, and a $3 million decline in amortization of basis difference as a result of the write-down of our investment in CareerBuilder in 2017, which eliminated the remaining basis difference for that investment. We sold our remaining ownership interest in CareerBuilder on September 13, 2018 and received pretax proceeds of $11 million, as further described in Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements. We recognized a pretax loss of $5 million on the sale of our ownership interest in CareerBuilder, which is included in the (loss) gain on investment transactions, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIncome on equity investments, net decreased 7%, or $11 million, in 2017 primarily due to lower equity income from CareerBuilder of $29 million as a result of a decline in operating performance, a decline in our ownership due to the sale of a majority of our interest in CareerBuilder on July 31, 2017, and non-recurring transaction expenses incurred by CareerBuilder in connection with the transaction. This decline was partially offset by an increase in equity income from TV Food Network of $18 million.\nIn 2017, we recorded non-cash pretax impairment charges of $181 million to write down our investment in CareerBuilder. Additionally, we recorded a non-cash pretax impairment charge of $10 million to write down our investment in Dose Media. These impairment charges are included in write-downs of investments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nCash distributions from our equity method investments were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18-17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17-16\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash distributions from equity investments (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>201,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Certain distributions received from CareerBuilder in 2017 exceeded the Company's share of CareerBuilder's cumulative earnings.

Cash distributions in the year ended December 31, 2018 included $6 million of distributions from CareerBuilder, of which $5 million related to a distribution of proceeds from the sale of one of its business operations in 2018. Cash distributions in the year ended December 31, 2017 included a $16 million distribution of excess cash from CareerBuilder prior to the closing of the CareerBuilder sale.\nTV Food Network cash distributions declined in 2018 due to lower required distributions to cover our taxes on our share of partnership income based on the reduction in tax rates from Tax Reform. This only impacts the timing of distributions and does not impact total expected excess cash distributions from TV Food Network related to 2018 operations.\nINTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT)\nInterest and dividend income, interest expense and income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18-17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17-16\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and dividend income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit) (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(301,373\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>347,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> *\n</td> <td>Represents positive or negative change in excess of 100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Interest expense excludes $1 million and $15 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to discontinued operations.

The increase of $9 million in 2018 was primarily due to higher interest income earned on our average outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents during 2018.\nInterest Expense-Interest expense from continuing operations was $169 million in 2018, $159 million in 2017 and $153 million in 2016 from our borrowing under the Secured Credit Facility and our borrowing under the Notes. Interest expense in 2018, 2017 and 2016 includes amortized debt issue costs of $6 million, $7 million and $10 million, respectively, and amortization of original issue discounts of $1 million in each year.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)-In 2018, we recorded income tax expense related to continuing operations of $113 million. The effective tax rate on pretax income from continuing operations was 21.5% in 2018. This rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state income taxes (net of federal benefit), other non-deductible expenses, a $24 million discrete income tax benefit primarily resulting from return to provision adjustments which have the effect of adjusting the provisional discrete net tax benefit recorded due to Tax Reform, as defined and described in Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements, partially offset by a $1 million charge primarily due to a decrease in our net state deferred tax assets as a result of a change in our state effective income tax rate. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform and net favorable adjustments, the effective tax rate on pretax income was 26.1%.\nIn 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit related to continuing operations of $301 million. The effective tax rate on pretax loss from continuing operations was 254.8% in 2017. This rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% at the time primarily due to a $256 million provisional discrete net tax benefit due to Tax Reform as further described in Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements, state income taxes (net of federal benefit), a benefit of $7 million due to a decrease to our net state deferred tax liabilities as a result of a change in our state effective income tax rate, the domestic production activities deduction, and other non-deductible expenses. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform and net favorable adjustments, the effective tax rate on pretax income was 33.1%.\nIn 2016, we recorded income tax expense related to continuing operations of $347 million. The effective tax rate on pretax income from continuing operations was 80.0% in 2016. This rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% at the time primarily due to state income taxes (net of federal benefit), a $103 million charge related to the settlement of the Newsday dispute, a related $88 million charge to adjust our deferred taxes (as further described in Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements), the domestic production activities deduction, other non-deductible expenses, a $12 million benefit related to the resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters and other adjustments, a $4 million charge related to the write-off of unrealized deferred tax assets related to stock-based compensation and a $3 million benefit resulting from a change in the Company's state tax rates. Excluding the Newsday settlement impact and net favorable adjustments, the effective tax rate on pretax income was 38.5%.\nAlthough we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable, the resolutions of our income tax issues are unpredictable and could result in income tax liabilities that are significantly higher or lower than that which has been provided by us.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash flows generated from operating activities is our primary source of liquidity. We expect to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, income tax payments, potential payments related to our uncertain tax positions, dividend payments on our Common Stock (see -Cash Dividends\u201d below) and related distributions to holders of Warrants and other operating requirements in the next twelve months through a combination of cash flows from operations, cash on our balance sheet, distributions from or sales of our investments, sales of real estate assets, available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, and any refinancings thereof, additional debt financing, if any, and disposals of assets or operations, if any. We intend to continue to maximize the monetization of our real estate portfolio to take advantage of robust market conditions although there can be no assurance that any such divestitures can be completed in a timely manner, on favorable terms or at all. The Nexstar Merger Agreement for the proposed Nexstar Merger places certain limitations on our use of cash, including our application of cash to repurchase shares of our Common Stock, our ability to declare any dividends other than quarterly cash dividends of $0.25 or less per share, our ability to make certain capital expenditures (except pursuant to our capital expenditures budget), and our ability to pursue significant business acquisitions.\nFor our long-term liquidity needs, in addition to these sources, we may rely upon the issuance of long-term debt, the issuance of equity or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for equity, or the sale of non-core\nassets. The Nexstar Merger Agreement for the proposed Nexstar Merger places certain limitations on the amount of debt we can incur.\nOur financial and operating performance remains subject to prevailing economic and industry conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and, despite our current liquidity position, no assurances can be made that cash flows from operations and investments, future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, and any refinancings thereof, or dispositions of assets or operations will be sufficient to satisfy our future liquidity needs.\nSources and Uses\nFor the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2018\nThe table below details the total operating, investing and financing activity cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>469,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>222,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>284,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>10,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>953,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>402,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(91,782\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,095,566\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(358,735\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Increase in Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>388,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>327,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $469 million in 2018, up $247 million from $223 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher cash flows from operating results and lower cash paid for income taxes, partially offset by 2018 pension contributions and lower distributions from our equity investments. Cash paid for income taxes, net of income tax refunds, decreased by $116 million to $66 million in 2018, from $183 million in 2017. Distributions from equity investments decreased by $27 million to $172 million in 2018 from $198 million in 2017 primarily due to timing of TV Food Network distributions related to Tax Reform, as further described above.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $223 million in 2017, down $62 million from $284 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower cash flows from operating results and unfavorable working capital changes, partially offset by lower cash paid for income taxes and higher distributions from equity investments. Cash paid for income taxes, net of income tax refunds, decreased by $83 million to $183 million in 2017, from $266 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the payment of taxes in the third quarter of 2016 related to the Newsday settlement. Distributions from equity investments increased by $28 million to $198 million in 2017 from $171 million in 2016.\nInvesting activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities totaled $11 million in 2018. Our capital expenditures totaled $76 million in 2018 and included $24 million related to the FCC spectrum repacking project. In 2018, we received net proceeds of $59 million primarily related to the sales of real estate, $15 million from the sales of investments and $11 million of repack reimbursements from the FCC.\nNet cash provided by investing activities totaled $953 million in 2017. Our capital expenditures totaled $67 million in 2017. In 2017, we received $554 million from the Gracenote Sale, $172 million related to gross proceeds from the sale of certain FCC licenses in the FCC spectrum auction, $148 million related to the sales of investments and $144 million primarily related to the sales of real estate. We made investments of $5 million in 2017, primarily consisting of a capital contribution to New Cubs LLC.\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $402 million in 2016. Our capital expenditures totaled $100 million in 2016. We had investments of $6 million and we received net proceeds of approximately $508 million from the sales of our real estate and other assets (see Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information).\nFinancing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $92 million in 2018. During 2018, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $88 million and paid $6 million of tax withholdings related to net share settlements of share-based awards.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.096 billion in 2017. During 2017, we repaid $704 million of borrowings under our Term Loan Facility and the Dreamcatcher Credit Facility, which included using $400 million of proceeds from the Gracenote Sale to prepay a portion of our Term B Loans in the first quarter of 2017 and using $102 million of after-tax proceeds received from our participation in the FCC spectrum auction to prepay $10 million of the Term B Loans and $91 million of the Term C Loans in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, we used $203 million of long-term borrowings of Term C Loans to repay $184 million of Term B Loans, with the remainder used to pay fees associated with the amendment to the Secured Credit Facility (the 2017 Amendment\u201d). We paid dividends of $586 million consisting of quarterly cash dividends of $87 million and the special cash dividend of $499 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $359 million in 2016. During 2016, we paid regular quarterly cash dividends of $90 million. In 2016, cash paid for the Class A Common Stock repurchases pursuant to our $400 million stock repurchase program totaled $232 million (see Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information).\nDebt and Capital Structure\nOur debt consisted of the following (in thousands):\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loan Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term B Loans due 2020, effective interest rate of 3.84%, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of $1,268 and $1,900\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>187,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term C Loans due 2024, effective interest rate of 3.85%, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance cost of $18,305 and $21,783\n</td> <td>1,647,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,644,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.875% Senior Notes due 2022, net of debt issuance costs of $9,861 and $12,649\n</td> <td>1,090,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,087,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,926,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,919,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSecured Credit Facility-On December 27, 2013, in connection with our acquisition of Local TV, we, as borrower, along with certain of our operating subsidiaries as guarantors, entered into a $4.073 billion Secured Credit Facility. The Secured Credit Facility consisted of the $3.773 billion Term Loan Facility and a $300 million Revolving Credit Facility. On June 24, 2015, we, all our domestic subsidiaries, other than certain excluded subsidiaries (the Guarantors\u201d) and JPMorgan, as administrative agent, entered into an amendment (the 2015 Amendment\u201d) to the Secured Credit Facility. Prior to the 2015 Amendment and the Prepayment (as defined below), $3.479 billion of term loans (the Former Term Loans\u201d) were outstanding under the Secured Credit Facility. Pursuant to the 2015 Amendment, certain lenders under the Secured Credit Facility converted their Former Term Loans into the new tranche of term loans (the Converted Term B Loans\u201d) in an aggregate amount, along with term loans advanced by certain new lenders, of $1.802 billion (the New Term B Loans\u201d and, together with the Converted Term B Loans, the Term B Loans\u201d). The proceeds of Term B Loans advanced by the new lenders were used to prepay in full all of the Former Term Loans that were not converted into Term B Loans. In addition, we used the net\nproceeds from the sale of the Notes (as defined below), together with cash on hand, to prepay (the Prepayment\u201d) $1.100 billion of Term B Loans. After giving effect to the 2015 Amendment and all prepayments contemplated thereby (including the Prepayment), there were $2.379 billion of Term B Loans outstanding under the Secured Credit Facility. See Note 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information and significant terms and conditions associated with the Secured Credit Facility, including, but not limited to, interest rates, repayment terms, fees, restrictions, and affirmative and negative covenants. The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility are available for working capital and other purposes not prohibited under the Secured Credit Facility. At December 31, 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility; however, there were $20 million of standby letters of credit outstanding primarily in support of our workers' compensation insurance programs.\nOn January 27, 2017, we, certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors (the Subsidiary Guarantors\u201d), JPMorgan, as administrative agent and certain extending lenders, entered into the 2017 Amendment pursuant to which we converted term loans outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the 2017 Amendment (the Existing Term Loans\u201d) into a new tranche of term loans in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.761 billion (the Term C Loans\u201d) and extended the maturity date of the Term C Loans. Under the Secured Credit Facility, the Term C Loans bear interest, at our election, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the sum of LIBOR, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements on Euro currency liabilities ( Adjusted LIBOR\u201d), subject to a minimum rate of 0.75%, plus an applicable margin of 3.0% or (ii) the sum of a base rate determined as the highest of (a) the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 0.5%, (b) the prime rate of interest announced by the administrative agent as its prime rate, and (c) Adjusted LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin of 2.0%. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, the loans made pursuant to a new tranche of revolving commitments (the New Initial Revolving Credit Commitment\u201d) bear interest initially, at the Company's election, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the sum of Adjusted LIBOR, subject to a minimum rate of zero, plus an applicable margin of 3.0% or (ii) the sum of a base rate determined as the highest of (a) the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 0.5%, (b) the prime rate of interest announced by the administrative agent as its prime rate, and (c) Adjusted LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin of 2.0%.\nThe Term C Loans and the New Initial Revolving Credit Loans are secured by the same collateral and guaranteed by the same guarantors as the Existing Term Loans. Voluntary prepayments of the Term C Loans are permitted at any time, in minimum principal amounts, without premium or penalty. The financial covenant is the same as in the existing credit agreement, except such covenant is only required to be tested at the end of each fiscal quarter if the aggregate amount of revolving loans, swingline loans and letters of credit (other than undrawn letters of credit and letters of credit that have been fully cash collateralized) outstanding exceed 35% of the aggregate amount of revolving commitments as of the date of the 2017 Amendment (after giving effect to Revolving Credit Facility Increase). The other terms of the Term C Loans and the New Initial Revolving Credit Loans are also generally the same as the terms of the Existing Term Loans and the revolving loans outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the 2017 Amendment (the Existing Revolving Loans\u201d). A portion of each of the Existing Term Loans and the Existing Revolving Loans remained in place following the 2017 Amendment and each will mature on its respective existing maturity date.\nOn January 27, 2017, immediately following effectiveness of the 2017 Amendment, we increased the amount of commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility from $300 million to $420 million (the Revolving Credit Facility Increase\u201d). In accordance with the 2017 Amendment, on December 27, 2018, the amount of commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility was reduced to $338 million.\nAs further described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, on February 1, 2017, we used $400 million of proceeds from the Gracenote Sale to prepay a portion of our Term B Loans. Subsequent to this payment, the quarterly installments related to the remaining principal amount of Term B Loans are no longer due. During the third quarter of 2017, we used $102 million of after-tax proceeds received from our participation in the FCC spectrum auction to prepay $10 million of the Term B Loans and $91 million of the Term C Loans. Subsequent to these payments, our quarterly installments related to the remaining principal amount of the Term C Loans are not due until the third quarter of 2022. See Note 10 to our\naudited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our participation in the FCC's incentive auction.\nAs a result of the 2017 Amendment and the Term Loan Facility prepayments, we recorded charges of $20 million on the extinguishments and modification of debt in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nUnder the Nexstar Merger Agreement, we may not incur debt, other than pursuant to our Revolving Credit Facility.\n5.875% Senior Notes due 2022-On June 24, 2015, we issued $1.100 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022, which we exchanged for substantially identical securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on May 4, 2016. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.875% per annum and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15, commencing on January 15, 2016. The Notes mature on July 15, 2022.\nDreamcatcher Credit Facility-We and the Guarantors guaranteed the obligations of Dreamcatcher under its Dreamcatcher Credit Facility. See Note 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a description of the Dreamcatcher Credit Facility. During the third quarter of 2017, we used $12.6 million of after-tax proceeds from the FCC spectrum auction to prepay the Dreamcatcher Credit Facility as any proceeds received by Dreamcatcher as a result of the FCC spectrum auction were required to first be used to repay the Dreamcatcher Credit Facility. The debt extinguishment charge recorded in 2017 associated with this prepayment was immaterial. We made the final payment to pay off the Dreamcatcher Credit Facility in full in September 2017.\nCapital Structure\nAs of the Effective Date, we issued 78,754,269 shares of Class A Common Stock and 4,455,767 shares of Class B Common Stock. In addition, on the Effective Date, we entered into the Warrant Agreement, pursuant to which we issued 16,789,972 Warrants. As permitted under the Plan, we adopted a new equity incentive plan for the purpose of granting awards to our directors, officers and employees and the directors, officers and employees of our subsidiaries (see Note 13 and Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information related to our capital structure and equity incentive plan, respectively). At December 31, 2018, the following amounts were issued: 101,790,837 shares of Class A Common Stock, of which 14,102,185 were held in treasury, 5,557 shares of Class B Common Stock and 30,551 Warrants.\nSince the Effective Date, we have substantially consummated the various transactions contemplated under the Plan. In particular, we have made all distributions of cash, common stock and warrants that were required to be made under the terms of the Plan to creditors holding allowed claims as of December 31, 2012. Claims of general unsecured creditors that become allowed on or after the Effective Date have been or will be paid on the next quarterly distribution date after such allowance.\nPursuant to the terms of the Plan, we are also obligated to make certain additional payments to certain creditors, including certain distributions that may become due and owing subsequent to the Effective Date and certain payments to holders of administrative expense priority claims and fees earned by professional advisors during the Chapter 11 proceedings. At December 31, 2018, restricted cash and cash equivalents held by the Company to satisfy the remaining claim obligations was $17 million and is estimated to be sufficient to satisfy such obligations.\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below includes future payments required for long-term debt, contractual agreements for broadcast rights recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, future minimum lease payments to be made under certain non-cancellable operating leases, and expected future payments under our multi-year talent and employment contracts related to our Television and Entertainment operations as well as certain other purchase obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Required or Expected Payments by Fiscal Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,955,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,123,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,642,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt (1)(2)\n</td> <td>745,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>323,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>247,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Broadcast rights contracts payable\n</td> <td>465,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>232,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>212,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum operating lease payments\n</td> <td>221,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Talent and employment contracts (3)\n</td> <td>127,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Programming not yet available for broadcast\n</td> <td>602,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>323,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other purchase obligations (4)\n</td> <td>120,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (5)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,238,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>899,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,035,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,536,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,767,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2018, we have $1.666 billion of Term C Loans outstanding.

See Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our funding obligations for these benefit plans.\nRepurchases of Equity Securities\nOn February 24, 2016, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $400 million of our outstanding Class A Common Stock. During 2016, we repurchased 6,432,455 shares for $232 million at an average price of $36.08 per share. We did not repurchase any shares of Common Stock during 2017 and 2018 due to restrictions contained in the now terminated Sinclair Merger Agreement. The Nexstar Merger Agreement prohibits us from engaging in additional share repurchases.\nCash Dividends\nThe Board declared quarterly cash dividends on our Common Stock to holders of record of Common Stock and Warrants as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nAmount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First quarter\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second quarter\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third quarter\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth quarter\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total quarterly cash dividends declared and paid\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn February 3, 2017, we paid a special cash dividend of $5.77 per share to holders of record of our Common Stock at the close of business on January 13, 2017. The total aggregate payment on February 3, 2017 totaled $499 million, including the payment to holders of Warrants.\nOn February 21, 2019, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend on Common Stock of $0.25 per share to be paid on March 25, 2019 to holders of record of Common Stock and Warrants as of March 11, 2019.\nThe declaration of any future dividends and the establishment of the per share amount, record dates and payment dates for any such future dividends are at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon various factors then existing, including earnings, financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to payment of dividends (including the restricted payment covenant contained in the credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facility and the Indenture, as further described in Note 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements), restrictions imposed by applicable law, general business conditions and other factors that the Board may deem relevant. Under the Nexstar Merger Agreement, we may not pay dividends other than quarterly cash dividends of $0.25 or less per share. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Warrant Agreement, concurrently with any cash dividend made to holders of the Company's Common Stock, holders of Warrants are entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of the dividend paid per share of Common Stock for each Warrant held. See Item 5 Market For Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\u201d\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements as defined by the SEC include the following four categories: obligations under certain guarantee contracts; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support; obligations under certain derivative arrangements classified as equity; and obligations under material variable interests. Except as described in the following paragraph, we have not entered into any material arrangements which would fall under any of these four categories and would be reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.\nConcurrent with the closing of the Chicago Cubs Transactions as discussed and defined in Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements, we executed guarantees of collection of certain debt facilities entered into by New Cubs LLC in 2009. As of December 31, 2017, the guarantees were capped at $699 million plus unpaid interest. In the first quarter of 2018, New Cubs LLC refinanced a portion of the debt which was guaranteed by the Company and the Company ceased being a guarantor of the refinanced debt. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining guarantees were capped at $249 million plus unpaid interest. On August 21, 2018, NEH provided the Call Notice to us that NEH was exercising its right to purchase our 5% membership interest in CEV LLC. We sold our 5% ownership interest in CEV LLC on January 22, 2019, as previously described. Concurrently with the sale, the Company ceased being a guarantor of all debt facilities held by New Cubs LLC.\nCapital Spending\nOur capital expenditures, including expenditures by the Gracenote Companies prior to the Gracenote Sale, totaled $76 million in 2018, $67 million in 2017 and $100 million in 2016.\nMajor capital projects during 2018 included investments at Television and Entertainment for FCC spectrum repacking, news gathering equipment, studio and newsroom upgrades as well as production equipment, news vehicles, computers and buildings, including the build-out of a new office/studio for our radio station in Chicago. In 2018, capital spending associated with the FCC spectrum repacking totaled $24 million. Corporate and Other investments primarily consisted of the continued build-out of our Corporate office in Chicago and real estate improvements.\nMajor capital projects during 2017 included investments at Television and Entertainment to build a new facility for one of our television stations and to enhance and update news gathering equipment, studio production equipment, news vehicles and computers. Corporate and Other investments primarily consisted of the build out of new Corporate offices in Chicago.\nMajor capital projects during 2016 included investments at Television and Entertainment to continue improvements to our facilities and to enhance and update news gathering equipment, studio production equipment and master control hardware. Our Digital and Data business continued to invest in infrastructure to support new business platforms and computer hardware. Corporate and Other investments primarily consisted of technology upgrades and real estate improvements.\nThe Company currently expects capital spending to be $79 million in 2019, which represents a $3 million increase over 2018. Major projects for 2019 include continued capital spending related to several stations that are required to change frequencies due to the FCC spectrum repacking as well as certain new transmitters, newsroom upgrades and a new facility for one of our stations. We expect to spend approximately $23 million on capital expenditures for the FCC spectrum repacking in 2019, which would represent the majority of our total remaining expected capital expenditures associated with the FCC spectrum repacking. We expect that reimbursements from the FCC's special fund will cover the majority of our capital costs and expenses related to the repacking. However, we cannot currently predict the effect of the repacking, whether the special fund will be sufficient to reimburse all of our expenses related to the repacking, the timing of reimbursements or any spectrum-related FCC regulatory action.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements. These policies conform with U.S. GAAP and reflect practices appropriate to our businesses. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our policies, estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.\nOur critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition, broadcast rights, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, impairment review of long-lived assets, income taxes and pension and other postretirement benefits. Management continually evaluates the development, selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates. In addition, there are other items within the consolidated financial statements that require the application of accounting policies and estimation, but are not deemed to be critical accounting policies and estimates. Changes in the estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition-We recognize revenues when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Our revenue sources for the Television and Entertainment segment include advertising revenues, retransmission revenues, carriage fees revenue, barter/trade revenues and other revenues. We adopted the new revenue guidance in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those\ncontracts which were not completed as of December 31, 2017. The only identified impact to our financial statements relates to barter revenue and expense as well as barter-related broadcast rights and contracts payable for broadcast rights, which are no longer recognized. Results for reporting periods prior to adoption continue to be presented in accordance with our historical accounting under Topic 605. If accounted for under Topic 605, barter revenue and expense would have been $28 million for fiscal year 2018. For fiscal years 2017 and 2016, barter revenue was $28 million and $30 million, respectively. In addition to the operating revenues included in the Television and Entertainment segment, our consolidated operating revenues include other revenue in Corporate and Other which consists of real estate revenues.\nAdvertising Revenues-We generate revenue by delivering advertising on our broadcast television, cable, radio and digital platforms. Certain of our advertising contracts have guarantees whereby the customer is guaranteed a certain level of audience viewership referred to as impressions. Contracts are typically fixed price, short term in nature and revenue is recognized over time as the advertisements are aired or the impressions are delivered. If the guaranteed impressions are not achieved through the airing of the initially agreed upon advertisements, we will continue to air advertisements for the customer until the guaranteed impressions are achieved. For these advertising contracts with guaranteed impressions, we recognize revenue based on the proportion of the cumulative impressions achieved for the advertisements delivered in relation to the total guaranteed impressions. Under the advertising contracts, we are entitled to payment as advertisements are aired, and the time between invoice and payment is not significant. We also trade advertising for products or services. Revenue recognized under trade arrangements is valued at the estimated fair value of the products or services received and recognized as the related advertisements are aired. We utilize the practical expedients provided in the guidance and do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for advertising contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less and for contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amounts to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.\nRetransmission Revenues and Carriage Fees-We enter into agreements with MVPDs which allow the MVPDs to retransmit our television stations' broadcast programming and/or carry our cable channel. Typically, the agreements are multi-year and generally consist of a fixed price per subscriber as well as contractually agreed annual increases. The agreements are considered functional licenses of intellectual property resulting in us recognizing revenue at the point-in-time the broadcast signal is delivered to the MVPDs. The typical time between our performance and customer payment is not significant. As the agreements with MVPDs are considered licenses of intellectual property, we apply the sales/usage based royalty exception in Topic 606 and do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for the agreements.\nDeferred Revenues-We record deferred revenue when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance. For advertising, the performance primarily involves the delivery of advertisements and/or impressions to our customers. For the spectrum sharing arrangements where we are acting as the host, the upfront payments received from our channel-sharing customers in 2017 have been deferred and are being recognized over a 30-year term.\nContract Costs-In accordance with Topic 606, incremental costs to obtain a contract are capitalized and amortized over the contract term if the cost are expected to be recoverable. We do not capitalize incremental costs to obtain a contract where the contract duration is expected to be one year or less. As of December 31, 2018, we do not have any costs capitalized.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations-Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is generally determined based on the price charged to customers.\nBroadcast Rights-We acquire rights to broadcast syndicated programs, original licensed series and feature films. Pursuant to ASC Topic 920, Entertainment-Broadcasters,\u201d these rights and the related liabilities are recorded as an asset and a liability when the license period has begun, the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing. The current portion of programming inventory includes those rights available for broadcast that are expected to be amortized in the succeeding year. We amortize our broadcast rights costs over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived based on the timing of the usage and benefit from such programming. Newer licensed/acquired programming and original produced programming are\ngenerally amortized on an accelerated basis as the episodes are aired. For certain categories of licensed programming and feature films that have been exploited through previous cycles, amortization expense is recorded on a straight-line basis. Program amortization for certain categories of programming is calculated on either an accelerated or straight-line basis based upon the greater amortization resulting from either the number of episodes aired or the portion of the license period consumed. We also have commitments for network and sports programming that are expensed on a straight-line basis as the programs are available to air. Management's judgment is required in determining the timing of the expensing of these costs, and includes analyses of historical and estimated future revenue and ratings patterns for similar programming. We regularly review, and revise when necessary, our revenue estimates, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization. Amortization of broadcast rights are expensed to programming in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nWe carry the broadcast rights at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value. We evaluate the net realizable value of broadcast rights on a daypart, series, or title-by-title basis, as appropriate. Changes in management's intended usage of a specific daypart, series, or program would result in a reassessment of the net realizable value, which could result in an impairment. We determine the net realizable value and estimated fair value, as appropriate, based on a projection of the estimated advertising revenues and carriage/retransmission revenues, less certain direct costs of delivery, expected to be generated by the program material, all of which are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. If our estimates of future revenues decline, amortization expense could be accelerated or impairment adjustments may be required. We assess future seasons of syndicated programs that we are committed to acquire for impairment as they become available to us for airing. Any impairments of programming rights are expensed to programming in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAs a result of the evaluation of the recoverability of the unamortized costs associated with broadcast rights, we recognized impairment charges at WGN America of $28 million for the syndicated program Elementary in 2018, $80 million for the syndicated programs Person of Interest and Elementary in 2017 and $37 million for the syndicated program Elementary in 2016. We had commitments to acquire up to four additional seasons of Elementary in future periods; however, the show was cancelled in 2018 with the final season to be aired in 2019, which we are obligated to purchase. An additional impairment may be required when this season becomes available to air if estimates of future revenues for this program have not improved. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had broadcast rights assets of $194 million and $263 million, respectively.\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets-We review goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired, in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.\u201d Under ASC Topic 350, the impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization must be based on estimated fair values. On January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).\u201d We adopted the standard on a prospective basis, effective in the first quarter of 2017. The standard simplifies the subsequent measure of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04, companies recognize an impairment charge for the amount the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. However, the loss recognized cannot exceed the total goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Goodwill and other intangibles not subject to amortization totaled $3.981 billion and $3.984 billion at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nOur annual impairment review measurement date is in the fourth quarter of each year. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is at or one level below our operating segment level. The reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating results of the component.\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017, we conducted our annual impairment test in accordance with ASC Topic 350. In performing our annual assessment, we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that a reporting unit has been impaired. As part of the qualitative assessment of our reporting units, we evaluate the impact of factors that are specific to the reporting units as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific factors include a comparison of the current year results to prior\nyear, current year budget and the budget for next fiscal year. We also consider the significance of the excess fair value over the carrying value reflected in prior quantitative assessments, the changes to the reporting units' carrying value since the last impairment test and the change in the overall enterprise value of the Company compared to the prior year.\nIf we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired or if we elect not to perform the optional qualitative assessment, we will perform a quantitative assessment. The quantitative assessment tests for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with the reporting unit's carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recorded as the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the carrying value. In performing the quantitative assessment, the fair value of a reporting units is determined with consideration of both the income and market valuation approaches. Under the income approach, the fair value is based on projected future discounted cash flows, which requires management's assumptions of projected revenues and related growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and terminal growth rates. Under the market valuation approach, the fair value is based on market multiples and consideration of market valuations of comparable companies.\nDuring our 2018 annual goodwill impairment test, we performed a qualitative assessment of the television and cable reporting units (reporting units within the Television and Entertainment reportable segment) which, at December 31, 2018, had goodwill balances of $2.505 billion and $723 million, respectively. Based on the qualitative assessment, we concluded that there were no impairments for either reporting unit. The conclusion was supported by the overall and budgeted financial performance, the current carrying values after considering the headroom from the last quantitative analysis of 16% and 23%, for the television and cable reporting units, respectively, the overall increase of the Company's enterprise value and other industry and macroeconomic factors.\nNo goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2017 or 2016.\nThe estimated fair values of other intangible assets subject to the annual impairment review, which include FCC licenses and a trade name, are evaluated qualitatively or generally calculated based on projected future discounted cash flow analyses. The determination of estimated fair values of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets requires many judgments, assumptions and estimates of several critical factors, including projected revenues and related growth rates, projected operating margins and cash flows, estimated income tax rates, capital expenditures, market multiples and discount rates, as well as specific economic factors such as market share for broadcasting and royalty rates for the trade name intangible. For our FCC licenses, significant assumptions also include start-up operating costs for an independent station, initial capital investments and market revenue forecasts. Fair value estimates for each of our indefinite-lived intangible assets are inherently sensitive to changes in these estimates, particularly with respect to the FCC licenses. Adverse changes in expected operating results and/or unfavorable changes in other economic factors could result in additional non-cash impairment charges in the future under ASC Topic 350.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded a non-cash pretax impairment charge of $3 million related to one FCC license in connection with our annual impairment review under ASC Topic 350. See Note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information. No impairment charges were recorded in 2017 for either FCC licenses or the trade name. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded a non-cash pretax impairment charge of $3 million related to two of our FCC licenses in connection with our annual impairment review under ASC Topic 350. See Note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nImpairment Review of Long-Lived Assets-In accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment,\u201d we evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group may be impaired. The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the projected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the asset or asset group over its remaining depreciable life are less than its current carrying value. We measure impairment based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group. The fair value is determined primarily by using the projected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved as well as market valuations. Losses on long-lived assets to\nbe disposed of are determined in a similar manner, except that the fair values are reduced for an estimate of the cost to dispose or abandon.\nThere were no impairment charges for long-lived assets recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we recorded charges totaling $2 million and $15 million, respectively, to write down certain real estate properties to their estimated fair value, less the expected selling costs. Adverse changes in expected operating results and/or unfavorable changes in other economic factors used to estimate future undiscounted cash flows could result in additional non-cash impairment charges in the future under ASC Topic 360.\nIncome Taxes-Provisions for federal and state income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Taxable income reported to the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate often differs from pretax earnings because some items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for income tax purposes. We provide deferred taxes on these temporary differences in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Taxable income also may differ from pretax earnings due to statutory provisions under which specific revenues are exempt from taxation and specific expenses are not allowable as deductions. The consolidated tax provision and related accruals include estimates of the potential taxes and related interest as deemed appropriate. These estimates are reevaluated and adjusted, if appropriate, on a quarterly basis. Although management believes its estimates and judgments are reasonable, the resolutions of our tax issues are unpredictable and could result in tax liabilities that are significantly higher or lower than that which has been provided by us.\nASC Topic 740 addresses the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under ASC Topic 740, a company may recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. ASC Topic 740 requires the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements to be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC Topic 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. See Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nOur effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to future impacts of various items, including changes in tax laws, tax planning as well as forecasted financial results. Management believes current estimates are reasonable, however, actual results can differ from these estimates.\nTax Reform significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. Tax Reform requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of Tax Reform and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of Tax Reform will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As we completed our analysis of Tax Reform, collected and prepared necessary data, and interpreted additional guidance, in 2018, we recorded an additional income tax benefit of $24 million to our net deferred tax liabilities, adjusting the provisional discrete net tax benefit of $256 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits-Retirement benefits are provided to employees through defined benefit pension plans sponsored either by us or by unions. Under our company-sponsored plans, pension benefits are primarily a function of both the years of service and the level of compensation for a specified number of years, depending on the plan. It is our policy to fund the minimum for our company-sponsored pension plans as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ( ERISA\u201d). Contributions made to union-sponsored plans are based upon collective bargaining agreements. We also provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The expected cost of providing these benefits is accrued over the years that the employees render services. It is our policy to fund postretirement benefits as claims are incurred. Accounting for\npension and other postretirement benefits requires the use of several assumptions and estimates. Actual experience or changes to these assumptions and other estimates could have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. See Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of all of the key assumptions related to pension and other postretirement benefits as well as a description of our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as well as additional disclosures.\nWe recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income (loss).\nWe utilize the Aon Hewitt AA-Only Bond Universe Yield Curve (the Aon Hewitt Yield Curve\u201d) for discounting future benefit obligations and calculating interest cost. The Aon Hewitt Yield Curve represents the yield on high quality (AA and above) corporate bonds that closely match the cash flows of the estimated payouts for our benefit obligations. As of December 31, 2018, a 0.5% decrease in our discount rate assumptions of 3.55% for our pension plans and 3.10% for our other postretirement plans would result in a $4 million increase in our 2018 net pension income and a $0.02 million increase in our 2018 other postretirement benefit income.\nWe used a multi-pronged approach to determine our 6.40% assumption for the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan assets. This approach included a review of actual historical returns achieved and anticipated long-term performance of each asset class. As of December 31, 2018, a 0.5% decrease in our long-term rate of return assumption would result in an $8 million decrease in our 2018 net pension income. Our pension plan assets earned a return of (6.5)% in 2018 and 14.6% in 2017. The asset returns are net of administrative expenses.\nOur pension actuarial valuation also incorporates other factors such as mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to, among other things, longer or shorter life spans of plan participants. Differences in these assumptions could significantly impact the actual amount of net periodic benefit cost and pension liability recorded by us.\nFor purposes of measuring postretirement health care costs for 2018, we assumed a 7.0% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% for 2025 and remain at that level thereafter. For purposes of measuring postretirement health care obligations at December 31, 2018, we assumed a 6.7% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% for 2025 and remain at that level thereafter.\nAssumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. As of December 31, 2018, a 1% change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects (in thousands): Table 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>1% Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1% Decrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service cost and interest cost\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected benefit obligation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(174\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 715, Compensation-Retirement Benefits,\u201d unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses will be recognized in net periodic pension expense over approximately 24 years, which represents the estimated average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants receiving benefits, due to plans being frozen and participants are deemed inactive for purposes of determining remaining useful life. Our policy is to incorporate asset-related gains and losses into the asset value used to calculate the expected return on plan assets and into the calculation of amortization of unrecognized net actuarial loss over a four-year period.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.", "summary": "-

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report, including Item 1. Business,\u201d Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and our audited consolidated financial statements for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 and notes thereto included in this Annual Report.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and other factors described throughout this Annual Report and particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nIntroduction\nThe following discussion and analysis compares our and our subsidiaries' results of operations for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018. As a result of the Gracenote Sale in 2017 (as further described below), the historical results of operations for the businesses included in the Gracenote Sale are reported as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Accordingly, all references made to financial data in this Annual Report are to Tribune Media Company's continuing operations, unless specifically noted.\nOverview\nWe are a diversified media and entertainment company comprised of 42 local television stations, which we refer to as our television stations,\u201d that are either owned by us or owned by others, but to which we provide certain services, along with a national general entertainment cable network, a radio station, a portfolio of real estate assets and investments in a variety of media, websites and other related assets.\nAs further described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements, on December 19, 2016, we entered into the Gracenote SPA with Nielsen to sell our equity interest in substantially all of the Digital and Data business as part of the transaction, which was completed on January 31, 2017. Prior to the Gracenote Sale, we reported our operations through the Television and Entertainment and Digital and Data reportable segments. Our Digital and Data segment consisted of several businesses driven by our expertise in collection, creation and distribution of data and innovation in unique services and recognition technology that used data, including Gracenote Video, Gracenote Music and Gracenote Sports. In accordance with ASU 2014-08, the results of operations of Digital and Data businesses included in the Gracenote Sale are reported as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nOur business consists of our Television and Entertainment operations and the management of certain of our real estate assets. As of December 31, 2018, we also held a variety of investments, including an equity method investment in TV Food Network, which provides substantial annual cash distributions, and an investment in CEV LLC, which was sold on January 22, 2019. Prior to the sale of our ownership interest on September 13, 2018, we also held an equity investment in CareerBuilder.\nTelevision and Entertainment is a reportable segment which provides audiences across the country with news, entertainment and sports programming on Tribune Broadcasting local television stations and distinctive, high quality television series and movies on WGN America as well as news, entertainment and sports information via our websites and other digital assets. Television and Entertainment includes 42 local television stations and related websites, including 39 owned stations and 3 stations to which we provide certain services (the SSAs\u201d) with Dreamcatcher; WGN America, a national general entertainment cable network; Antenna TV and THIS TV, national multicast networks; and WGN-AM, a radio station in Chicago. The television stations, including the 3 stations owned by Dreamcatcher (a fully-consolidated VIE), are comprised of 14 FOX television affiliates; 12 CW television\naffiliates; 6 CBS television affiliates; 3 ABC television affiliates; 3 MY television affiliates; 2 NBC television affiliates; and 2 independent television stations.\nIn addition, we report and include under Corporate and Other the management of certain of our real estate assets, including revenues from leasing our owned office and production facilities and any gains or losses from the sales of our owned real estate, as well as certain administrative activities associated with operating corporate office functions.\nTelevision and Entertainment represented 99% of our consolidated operating revenues in 2018. Approximately 66% of these revenues came from the sale of advertising spots. Changes in advertising revenues are heavily correlated with and influenced by changes in the level of economic activity and the demand for political advertising spots in the United States. Changes in gross domestic product, consumer spending levels, auto sales, political advertising levels, programming content, audience share, and rates all impact demand for advertising on our television stations. Our advertising revenues are subject to changes in these factors both on a national level and on a local level in the markets in which we operate. Television and Entertainment operating revenues also included retransmission revenues and carriage fees, which represented approximately 24% and 8%, respectively, of Television and Entertainment's 2018 total operating revenues.\nSignificant expense categories for Television and Entertainment include compensation expense, programming expense, depreciation expense, amortization expense, primarily resulting from the adoption of fresh-start reporting on the Effective Date (as defined below), and other expenses. Compensation expense represented 36% of Television and Entertainment's 2018 total operating expenses before the gain on sales of spectrum and is impacted by many factors, including the number of full-time equivalent employees, changes in the design and costs of the various employee benefit plans, the level of pay increases and our actions to reduce staffing levels. Programming expense represented 32% of Television and Entertainment's 2018 total operating expenses before the gain on sales of spectrum. The level of programming expense is affected by the cost of programs available for purchase and the selection of programs aired by our television stations. Depreciation expense and amortization expense represented 3% and 11% of Television and Entertainment's 2018 total operating expenses, respectively, before the gain on sales of spectrum. Other expenses represented 18% of Television and Entertainment's 2018 total operating expenses before the gain on sales of spectrum and are principally for sales and marketing activities, occupancy costs and other station operating expenses.\nWe use operating revenues and operating profit as ways to measure the financial performance of our business segments. In addition, we use audience and revenue share for our television stations, together with other factors, to measure our Television and Entertainment market shares and performance.\nOur results of operations, when examined on a quarterly basis, reflect the historical seasonality of our advertising revenues. Typically, second and fourth quarter advertising revenues are higher than first and third quarter advertising revenues. Results for the second quarter usually reflect spring seasonal advertising, while the fourth quarter includes advertising related to the holiday season. In addition, our operating results are subject to fluctuations from political advertising as political spending is usually significantly higher in even numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections.\nSignificant Events\nNexstar Merger Agreement\nOn November 30, 2018, we entered into the Nexstar Merger Agreement, providing for the acquisition by Nexstar of all of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, by means of a merger of Nexstar Merger Sub with and into Tribune Media Company, with the Company surviving the Nexstar Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nexstar.\nIn the Nexstar Merger, each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Nexstar Merger (the Effective Time\u201d) (other than shares held by (i) any Tribune subsidiary, Nexstar or any Nexstar subsidiary or (ii) Tribune shareholders who have not voted in favor of adopting the Nexstar Merger\nAgreement and who have demanded and perfected (and not validly withdrawn or waived) their appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL) will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment of $46.50 in cash (the base merger consideration\u201d), plus, if the Nexstar Merger closes after August 31, 2019 (the Adjustment Date\u201d), an additional amount in cash equal to (a) (i) $0.009863 multiplied by (ii) the number of calendar days elapsed after Adjustment Date to and including the date on which the Nexstar Merger closes, minus (b) the amount of any dividends declared by us after the Adjustment Date with a record date prior to the date on which the Nexstar Merger closes, in each case, without interest and less any required withholding taxes (the additional per share consideration\u201d, and together with the base merger consideration, the Nexstar Merger Consideration\u201d). The additional per share consideration will not be less than zero.\nEach option to purchase shares of Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, for each share of Common Stock subject to such stock option, a cash payment equal to the excess, if any, of the value of the Nexstar Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such stock option, without any interest and subject to all applicable withholding. Any stock option that has an exercise price per share that is greater than or equal to the Nexstar Merger Consideration will be cancelled for no consideration or payment. Each award of restricted stock units outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, will immediately vest and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of the total number of shares of Common Stock underlying such restricted stock unit multiplied by the Nexstar Merger Consideration, without any interest and subject to all applicable withholding (the RSU Consideration\u201d), except that each award of restricted stock units granted to an employee on or after December 1, 2018 (other than restricted stock units required to be granted pursuant to employment agreements or offer letters) ( Annual Tribune RSUs\u201d) that has vested as of the Effective Time of the Nexstar Merger will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the RSU Consideration and any Annual Tribune RSUs that remain unvested as of the Effective Time of the Nexstar Merger will be cancelled for no consideration or payment. Each award of performance stock units outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, will immediately vest (with performance conditions for each open performance period as of the closing date deemed achieved at the applicable target\u201d level performance for such performance stock units) and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of the total number of shares of Common Stock underlying such performance stock units multiplied by the Nexstar Merger Consideration, without any interest and subject to all applicable withholding. Each outstanding award of deferred stock units outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of the total number of shares of Common Stock underlying such deferred stock units multiplied by the Nexstar Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to all applicable withholding. Each unexercised warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be assumed by Nexstar and converted into a warrant exercisable for the Nexstar Merger Consideration which the shares of Common Stock underlying such warrant would have been entitled to receive upon consummation of the Nexstar Merger and otherwise upon the same terms and conditions of such warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time.\nThe consummation of the Nexstar Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions, including, among others: (i) the adoption of the Nexstar Merger by holders of a majority of our outstanding Common Stock, (ii) the receipt of approval from the FCC and the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the Nexstar Merger under the HSR Act and (iii) the absence of any order or law of any governmental authority that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Nexstar Merger. Our and Nexstar's respective obligations to consummate the Nexstar Merger are also subject to certain additional customary conditions, including (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (generally subject to a material adverse effect\u201d standard), (ii) performance by the other party of its covenants in the Nexstar Merger Agreement in all material respects and (iii) with respect to Nexstar's obligation to consummate the Nexstar Merger, since the date of the Nexstar Merger Agreement, no material adverse effect with respect to Tribune having occurred.\nThe applications for FCC Approval were filed on January 7, 2019. On February 14, 2019, the FCC issued a public notice of filing of the applications which set deadlines for petitions to deny the applications, oppositions to petitions to deny and replies to oppositions to petitions to deny.\nOn February 7, 2019, we received a request for additional information and documentary material, often referred to as a second request,\u201d from the DOJ in connection with the Nexstar Merger Agreement. The second request was issued under the HSR Act. Nexstar received a substantively identical request for additional information and documentary material from the DOJ in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Nexstar Merger Agreement. Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Nexstar Merger Agreement is conditioned on expiration of the waiting period applicable under the HSR Act, among other conditions. Issuance of the second request extends the waiting period under the HSR Act until 30 days after Nexstar and the Company have substantially complied with the second request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the DOJ or the parties voluntarily extend the time for closing.\nThe Nexstar Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time: (i) by mutual written consent of Nexstar and us; (ii) by either Nexstar or us (a) if the Effective Time has not occurred on or before November 30, 2019, provided that (x) if, on the initial end date, any of the conditions to the consummation of the Nexstar Merger related to the HSR Approval or the FCC Approval have not been satisfied, but all other conditions the consummation of the Nexstar Merger have been satisfied or waived or capable of being satisfied, then the end date will be automatically extended to February 29, 2020 and (y) in the event the marketing period for the debt financing for the transaction has commenced but has not completed by the end date, the end date may be extended (or further extended) by Nexstar on one occasion in its sole discretion by providing written notice thereof to us at least one business day prior to the end date until the date that is four business days after the last scheduled expiration date of the marketing period (unless the failure of the Effective Time to occur before the end date was primarily due to such party's breach of any of its obligations under the Nexstar Merger Agreement), (b) if any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction has issued an order permanently prohibiting the consummation of the Nexstar Merger and such order has become final and non-appealable (unless such order was primarily attributable to such party's breach of the Nexstar Merger Agreement), or (c) if, after completion of the special meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof), our shareholders have not approved the adoption of the Nexstar Merger Agreement; and (iii) either Nexstar or us in certain circumstances, as described in the Nexstar Merger Agreement.\nWe must pay Nexstar a termination fee of $135 million if Nexstar terminates the Nexstar Merger Agreement due to (a) our board or any committee thereof (i) withdrawing, rescinding, amending, changing, modifying or qualifying, or otherwise proposing publicly to take any of the foregoing actions in a manner adverse to Nexstar, its recommendation that our shareholders adopt the Nexstar Merger Agreement, (ii) failing to make such recommendation in our proxy statement, (iii) adopting, approving or recommending, or otherwise proposing publicly to adopt, approve or recommend, an alternative acquisition proposal, (iv) failing to publicly recommend against an alternative acquisition proposal that has been publicly disclosed within ten business days of Nexstar's request and failing to reaffirm its recommendation within such period upon such request (provided that such a request may be delivered by Nexstar only once with respect to each alternative acquisition proposal, with the right to make an additional request with respect to each subsequent material amendment or modification thereto), or (v) taking any action to make the provisions of any fair price,\u201d moratorium,\u201d control share acquisition,\u201d business combination\u201d or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation inapplicable to any transaction other than the transactions contemplated by the Nexstar Merger Agreement; (b) we or any of our subsidiaries having entered into any agreement, other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement, with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal; or (c) we terminate the Nexstar Merger Agreement due to our board authorizing us to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement.\nAs further described in the Nexstar Merger Agreement, we must pay Nexstar a termination fee of $135 million (except that the termination fee of $135 million will be reduced by any previously paid amounts relating to the documented, out-of-pocket expenses of Nexstar in an amount not to exceed $15 million) if: (a) we or Nexstar terminate the Nexstar Merger Agreement if the Effective Time has not occurred prior to the end date of November 30, 2019, subject to an automatic extension to February 29, 2020 in certain circumstances if the only outstanding\nunfulfilled conditions relate to HSR Approval or FCC Approval (and an additional extension, at Nexstar's election, if the marketing period for the debt financing for the transaction has not ended by the end date); (b) we or Nexstar terminate the Nexstar Merger Agreement if, after completion of the special meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof), our shareholders have not approved the adoption of the Nexstar Merger Agreement; or (c) Nexstar terminates the Nexstar Merger Agreement in respect of a willful breach of our covenants or agreements that would give rise to the failure of a closing condition that is incapable of being cured within a specified time period, and, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses, an alternative acquisition proposal has been made to us and publicly announced or otherwise disclosed and has not been withdrawn prior to the termination of the Nexstar Merger Agreement, the date of the special meeting (in the case of a termination for failure to obtain approval of the adoption of the Nexstar Merger Agreement by our shareholders) or the date of the applicable breach giving rise to termination, as applicable, and within twelve months after termination of the Nexstar Merger Agreement, we enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal (and subsequently consummates such transaction) or consummates a transaction with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal.\nWe must pay Nexstar the documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Nexstar in an amount not to exceed $15 million if we or Nexstar terminate the Nexstar Merger Agreement because our shareholders do not approve the transaction.\nTermination of Sinclair Merger Agreement\nOn May 8, 2017, we entered into the Sinclair Merger Agreement with Sinclair, providing for the acquisition by Sinclair of all of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock by means of a merger of Samson Merger Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Sinclair, with and into Tribune Media Company, with Tribune Media Company surviving the Sinclair Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Sinclair.\nThe consummation of the Sinclair Merger was subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain important conditions, including, among others: the receipt of approval from the FCC and the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the Sinclair Merger under the HSR Act. Pursuant to the Sinclair Merger Agreement, we had the right to terminate the Sinclair Merger Agreement if Sinclair failed to perform in all material respects its covenants, and such failure was not cured by the end date of August 8, 2018. Additionally, either party could terminate the Sinclair Merger Agreement if the Sinclair Merger was not consummated on or before August 8, 2018 (and the failure for the Sinclair Merger to have been consummated by such date was not primarily due to a breach of the Sinclair Merger Agreement by the party terminating the Sinclair Merger Agreement). On August 9, 2018, we provided notification to Sinclair that we had terminated the Sinclair Merger Agreement, effective immediately, on the basis of Sinclair's willful and material breaches of its covenants and the expiration of the end date thereunder. Additionally, on August 9, 2018, we filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Sinclair (the Complaint\u201d), alleging that Sinclair willfully and materially breached its obligations under the Sinclair Merger Agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain regulatory approval of the Sinclair Merger so as to enable the Sinclair Merger to close as soon as reasonably practicable. The lawsuit seeks damages for all losses incurred as a result of Sinclair's breach of contract under the Sinclair Merger Agreement. On August 29, 2018, Sinclair filed an answer to our Complaint and a counterclaim (the Counterclaim\u201d). The Counterclaim alleges that we materially and willfully breached the Sinclair Merger Agreement by failing to use reasonable best efforts to obtain regulatory approval of the Sinclair Merger. On September 18, 2018, we filed an answer to the Counterclaim. We believe the Counterclaim is without merit and intend to defend it vigorously.\nOn May 8, 2018, we, Sinclair Television Group, Inc. ( Sinclair Television\u201d) and Fox Television Stations, LLC ( Fox\u201d) entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Fox Purchase Agreement\u201d) to sell the assets of seven network affiliates for $910 million in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments. The network affiliates subject to the Fox Purchase Agreement were: KCPQ (Tacoma, WA); KDVR (Denver, CO); KSTU (Salt Lake City, UT); KSWB-TV (San Diego, CA); KTXL (Sacramento, CA); WJW (Cleveland, OH); and WSFL-TV (Miami, FL). In connection with the termination of the Sinclair Merger Agreement on August 9, 2018, we provided notification to Fox that we terminated the Fox Purchase Agreement, effective immediately. Under the terms of the Fox Purchase Agreement, no termination fees were payable by any party.\nTax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Reform\u201d) was signed into law. Under ASC Topic 740, the effects of Tax Reform are recognized in the period of enactment and as such were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Consistent with the guidance under ASC Topic 740, and subject to Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB\u201d) 118, which provides for a measurement period to complete the accounting for certain elements of Tax Reform, we recorded the provisional impact from the enactment of Tax Reform in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result of Tax Reform, we recorded a provisional discrete net tax benefit of $256 million, primarily due to a remeasurement of the net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In 2018, we completed the accounting for income tax effects of Tax Reform and recorded an additional income tax benefit of $24 million to the net deferred tax liabilities, primarily resulting from return to provision adjustments which have the effect of adjusting the provisional discrete net tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. The tax benefit was recorded as the result of new information, including higher than expected pension contributions and new filing positions reported in the Company's income tax returns as they became due. While we consider the income tax accounting related to Tax Reform to be complete, we continue to evaluate new guidance and tax legislation as it is issued. Tax Reform also provided for a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) through the year ended December 31, 2017. We do not have any net accumulated E&P in our foreign subsidiaries and therefore are not subject to tax for the year ended December 31, 2017. Further, we have analyzed the effects of new taxes due on certain foreign income, such as global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d), base-erosion anti-abuse tax ( BEAT\u201d), foreign-derived intangible income ( FDII\u201d) and limitations on interest expense deductions (if certain conditions apply) that are effective starting in fiscal 2018. We have determined that these new provisions are not applicable to us.\nMonetization of Real Estate Assets\nIn the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, we sold several properties for net pretax proceeds totaling $59 million, $144 million and $506 million, respectively, and recognized a net pretax gain of $25 million, $29 million and $213 million, respectively. We define net proceeds as pretax cash proceeds on the sale of properties, net of associated selling costs. See Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements for details on real estate sales for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018.\nFCC Spectrum Auction\nOn April 13, 2017, the FCC announced the conclusion of the incentive auction, the results of the reverse and forward auction and the repacking of broadcast television spectrum. We participated in the auction and have received approximately $191 million in pretax proceeds (including $26 million of proceeds received by a Dreamcatcher station) as of December 31, 2017. The proceeds reflect the FCC's acceptance of one or more bids placed by us or channel share partners of television stations owned or operated by us during the auction to modify and/or surrender spectrum used by certain of such bidder's television stations. We used $102 million of after-tax proceeds to prepay a portion of our Term Loan Facility. After-tax proceeds of $12.6 million received by a Dreamcatcher station were used to prepay a substantial portion of the Dreamcatcher Credit Facility. FCC licenses with a carrying value of $39 million were included in assets held for sale as of December 31, 2017. In 2017, we received $172 million in gross pretax proceeds for these licenses as part of the FCC spectrum auction, and in the\nfirst quarter of 2018, we recognized a net pretax gain of $133 million related to the surrender of the spectrum of these television stations in January 2018. In 2017, we also received $84 million of pretax proceeds for sharing arrangements whereby we will provide hosting services to the counterparties. Additionally, we paid $66 million of proceeds in 2017 to counterparties who will host certain of our television stations under sharing arrangements.\nTwenty-two of our television stations (including WTTK, which operates as a satellite station of WTTV) are required to change frequencies or otherwise modify their operations as a result of the repacking, as further described in Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements. In doing so, the stations could incur substantial conversion costs, reduction or loss of over-the-air signal coverage or an inability to provide high definition programming and additional program streams. The legislation authorizing the incentive auction provides the FCC with a $1.750 billion special fund to reimburse reasonable capital costs and expenses incurred by stations that are reassigned to new channels in the repacking, which amount was increased by $1 billion pursuant to the adoption of an amended version of the Repack Airwaves Yielding Better Access for Users of Modern Services (RAY BAUM'S) Act of 2018 by the U.S. Congress on March 23, 2018. A majority of our capital expenditures for the FCC spectrum repacking occurred in 2018 and are expected to occur in 2019. Through December 31, 2018, we incurred $27 million in capital expenditures for the spectrum repack, of which $24 million were incurred in 2018. We received FCC reimbursements of $11 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The reimbursements are included as a reduction to SG&A expense in our audited Consolidated Statement of Operations and are presented as an investing inflow in our audited Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We expect that the reimbursements from the FCC's special fund will cover the majority of our capital costs and expenses related to the repacking. However, we cannot currently predict the effect of the repacking, whether the special fund will be sufficient to reimburse all of our expenses related to the repacking, the timing of reimbursements or any spectrum-related FCC regulatory action.\nChapter 11 Reorganization\nOn December 8, 2008 (the Petition Date\u201d) the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief (collectively, the Chapter 11 Petitions\u201d) under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. As further defined and described in Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements, a plan of reorganization for the Debtors became effective and the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11 on December 31, 2012. The Bankruptcy Court has entered final decrees that have collectively closed 106 of the Debtors' Chapter 11 cases. The remaining Debtors' Chapter 11 proceedings continue to be jointly administered under the caption In re: Tribune Media Company, et al., Case No.08-13141.\nFrom the Petition Date and until the Effective Date, the Debtors operated their businesses as debtors-in-possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and applicable orders of the Bankruptcy Court. In general, as debtors-in-possession, the Debtors were authorized under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to continue to operate as ongoing businesses, but could not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court.\nOn the Effective Date, all of the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied or waived, the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11, and the settlements, agreements and transactions contemplated by the Plan to be effected on the Effective Date were implemented, including, among other things, the appointment of a new board of directors and the initiation of distributions to creditors. As a result, our ownership changed from the ESOP to certain of our creditors on the Effective Date. On January 17, 2013, our Board of Directors appointed a chairman of the board and a new chief executive officer. Such appointments were effective immediately.\nSince the Effective Date, we have substantially consummated the various transactions contemplated under the Plan. In particular, we have made all distributions of cash, Common Stock and Warrants that were required to be made under the terms of the Plan to creditors holding allowed claims as of December 31, 2012. Claims of general unsecured creditors that become allowed claims on or after the Effective Date have been or will be paid on the next quarterly distribution date after such allowance. At December 31, 2018, restricted cash and cash equivalents held by us to satisfy the remaining claims obligations was $17 million and is estimated to be sufficient to satisfy such\nobligations. If the aggregate allowed amount of the remaining claims exceeds the restricted cash and cash equivalents held for satisfying such claims, we will be required to satisfy the allowed claims from our cash on hand from operations. See Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Chapter 11 proceedings.\nChicago Cubs Transactions\nAs further described in Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements, we consummated the closing of the Chicago Cubs Transactions on October 27, 2009. As a result of these transactions, NEH owned 95% and we owned 5% of the membership interests in CEV LLC. The fair market value of the contributed assets exceeded the tax basis and did not result in an immediate taxable gain because the transaction was structured to comply with the partnership provisions of the IRC and related regulations. On June 28, 2016, the IRS issued to us a Notice of Deficiency ( Notice\u201d) which presents the IRS's position that the gain should have been included in our 2009 taxable income. Accordingly, the IRS has proposed a $182 million tax and a $73 million gross valuation misstatement penalty. In addition, after-tax interest on the aforementioned proposed tax and penalty through December 31, 2018 would be approximately $81 million. We continue to disagree with the IRS's position that the transaction generated a taxable gain in 2009, the proposed penalty and the IRS's calculation of the gain. During the third quarter of 2016, we filed a petition in U.S. Tax Court to contest the IRS's determination. We continue to pursue resolution of this disputed tax matter with the IRS. If the IRS prevails in their position, the gain on the Chicago Cubs Transactions would be deemed to be taxable in 2009. We estimate that the federal and state income taxes would be approximately $225 million before interest and penalties. Any tax, interest and penalty due will be offset by tax payments made relating to this transaction subsequent to 2009. As of December 31, 2018, we have paid or accrued approximately $80 million of federal and state tax payments through our regular tax reporting process. We do not maintain any tax reserves relating to the Chicago Cubs Transactions. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 include a deferred tax liability of $69 million and $96 million, respectively, related to the future recognition of taxable income related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions.\nOn August 21, 2018, NEH provided the Call Notice to us that NEH was exercising its right to purchase our 5% membership interest in CEV LLC. We sold our 5% ownership interest in CEV LLC on January 22, 2019 and received pretax proceeds of $107.5 million. We expect to recognize a pretax gain of $86 million in the first quarter of 2019. As a result of the sale, the total remaining deferred tax liability of $69 million will become currently payable in 2019. The sale of our ownership interest in CEV LLC has no impact on our dispute with the IRS.\nEmployee Reductions\nWe recorded pretax charges, mainly consisting of employee severance costs, associated termination benefits and related expenses totaling $7 million, $5 million and $10 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These charges are included in direct operating expenses or SG&A expense, as appropriate, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table summarizes these severance and related charges included in income from continuing operations by business segment (in thousands):\n\nThe accrued liability for severance and related expenses was $7 million and $5 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nNon-Operating Items\nNon-operating items were as follows (in thousands):\n\nNon-operating items for 2018 included a pretax loss of $5 million from the sale of our remaining ownership interest in CareerBuilder and a pretax gain of $4 million from the sale of one of our other equity investments.\nNon-operating items for 2017 included a $20 million pretax loss on the extinguishments and modification of debt. The loss included a write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $7 million and an unamortized discount of $2 million as a portion of the Term Loan Facility was considered extinguished for accounting purposes as well as an expense of $12 million of third party fees as a portion of the Term Loan Facility was considered a modification transaction under ASC 470, Debt.\u201d (Loss) gain on investment transactions, net included a pretax gain of $5 million from the sale of our Tribune Publishing shares and a pretax gain of $4 million from the partial sale of CareerBuilder. Write-downs of investments included non-cash pretax impairment charges of $193 million to write down our investments in CareerBuilder and Dose Media, LLC ( Dose Media\u201d) and one of our other equity investments (as further described in Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements).\nNon-operating items for 2016 included a $5 million non-cash favorable workers' compensation reserve adjustment related to businesses divested by us in prior years.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion of our annual results of operations only relates to our continuing operations, unless otherwise noted.\nAs described previously, on December 19, 2016, we entered into the Gracenote SPA with Nielsen to sell our equity interest in substantially all of the Digital and Data business. As a result, the historical results of operations for the businesses included in the Gracenote Sale are reported in discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Television and Entertainment reportable segment includes the operations of Covers, a sports betting information website, which was previously included in the Digital and Data reportable segment. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation; the impact of this reclassification was immaterial.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( Topic 606\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2014-09 created Topic 606 and superseded the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.\u201d We adopted the new revenue guidance in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of December 31, 2017. Results for reporting periods prior to adoption continue to be presented in accordance with our historical accounting under Topic 605. The only identified impact to our financial statements relates to barter revenue and expense as well as barter-related broadcast rights and contracts payable for broadcast rights, which are no longer recognized.\nFor the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2018\nCONSOLIDATED\nConsolidated operating results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are shown in the table below (in thousands).\n\n \n * Represents positive or negative change in excess of 100%  Operating Revenues and Profit (Loss)-Consolidated operating revenues and operating profit (loss) by business segment were as follows (in thousands):\n\n \n * Represents positive or negative change in excess of 100%  2018 compared to 2017\nConsolidated operating revenues increased 9%, or $161 million, in 2018 primarily due to an increase of $163 million in Television and Entertainment revenues driven by higher advertising revenue, retransmission revenues and carriage fees, partially offset by the absence of barter revenue due to the new revenue guidance adopted in 2018. Consolidated operating profit was $488 million in 2018 compared to $86 million in 2017, representing an increase of $403 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher Television and Entertainment operating profit largely due to a net pretax gain of $133 million related to licenses sold in the FCC spectrum auction, an increase in revenue and lower programming expenses as well as a lower Corporate and Other operating loss primarily due to a decrease in compensation, other expenses and depreciation. Programming expenses included a program impairment charge of $28 million for the syndicated program Elementary at WGN America in 2018 compared to a program impairment charge of $80 million in 2017 for the syndicated programs Elementary and Person of Interest at WGN America.\n2017 compared to 2016\nConsolidated operating revenues decreased 5%, or $99 million, in 2017 primarily due to a decrease of $74 million in Television and Entertainment revenues driven by lower advertising and other revenue, partially offset by higher retransmission revenue and carriage fees. Additionally, Corporate and Other revenues declined by $24 million primarily due to the loss of revenue from real estate properties sold in 2016 and 2017. Consolidated operating profit was $86 million in 2017 compared to $409 million in 2016, representing a decrease of $323 million primarily due to a $185 million decline in gains recorded on the sales of real estate from $213 million in 2016 to $29 million in 2017 and lower Television and Entertainment operating profit. Television and Entertainment operating profit decreased due to lower revenues and higher programming expenses partly resulting from a $43 million increase in program impairment charges. Programming expenses included a program impairment charge of $80 million for the syndicated programs Elementary and Person of Interest at WGN America in 2017 compared to a program impairment charge of $37 million in 2016 for the syndicated program Elementary at WGN America.\nOperating Expenses-Consolidated operating expenses were as follows (in thousands):\n\n \n * Represents positive or negative change in excess of 100%  2018 compared to 2017\nProgramming expenses, which represented 24% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 33% for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased 19%, or $115 million, due largely to the $51 million decrease in program impairment charges described above as well as lower amortization of license fees, the absence of barter expense in 2018 and a total of $19 million of additional expense in 2017 related to a shift in programming strategy at WGN America in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher network affiliate fees. The decrease in amortization of license fees of $73 million was primarily attributable to three originals airing in the first half of 2017 (Outsiders, Underground and Salem) versus airing lower cost programming in 2018. Barter expense decreased $28 million as we no longer recognize barter revenue and expense as a result of adopting new revenue guidance in 2018. Network affiliate fees increased by $59 million mainly due to the renewal of network affiliation agreements in eight markets with FOX during the third quarter of 2018, along with other contractual increases.\nDirect operating expenses, which represented 20% of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 21% for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased 2%, or $10 million, due mainly to increases in compensation and outside services expense. Compensation expense increased $5 million due to higher direct pay and benefits. Outside services expense increased $4 million primarily due to costs associated with spectrum sharing arrangements and costs for operating websites.\nSG&A expenses, which represented 28% of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 31% for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased 1%, or $5 million, primarily due to lower compensation and other expenses, partially offset by an increase in outside services expense. Compensation expense decreased 1%, or $4\nmillion, due to a $13 million decline at Corporate and Other, partially offset by a $10 million increase at Television & Entertainment. The decline at Corporate and Other was primarily due to the prior year expense of $13 million ($6 million of severance and $7 million of stock-based compensation) related to the resignation of the CEO in the first quarter of 2017. In addition, direct pay and benefits decreased by $1 million and severance decreased by $1 million, offset by a $2 million increase in retention bonuses ($9 million in 2018 compared to $7 million in 2017). Compensation expense increased $10 million at Television & Entertainment due to a $9 million increase in incentive compensation, a $4 million increase in retention bonuses ($5 million in 2018 compared to $1 million in 2017) and a $3 million increase in severance, partially offset by a $6 million decrease in direct pay and benefits and a $1 million decrease in stock-based compensation. Other expenses decreased 2%, or $4 million, as the receipt of $11 million of spectrum repack reimbursements, a $2 million decrease in rent expense and a $1 million decrease in promotion expense were partially offset by a $5 million increase in outside national sales representative commissions, $4 million of costs related to a litigation reserve and a non-cash impairment charge of $3 million related to the impairment of an FCC license at one of our television stations in 2018. Outside services expense increased 2%, or $2 million, driven by higher professional and legal fees.\nGain on sales of real estate, net of $25 million for 2018 related to the sales of our properties in Melville, NY and Hartford, CT, as further described in Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation expense fell 4%, or $2 million, in 2018. Amortization expense remained flat in 2018.\nGain on sales of spectrum of $133 million for 2018 relates to licenses sold in the FCC spectrum auction for which the spectrum of these television stations was surrendered in January 2018, as further described in Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\n2017 compared to 2016\nProgramming expenses, which represented 33% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 26% for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased 17%, or $88 million, due largely to a $43 million increase in program impairment charges and a total of $19 million of expense related to the shift in programming strategy at WGN America in the second quarter of 2017. This included cancellation costs for Outsiders and Underground and the associated accelerated amortization of remaining programming assets for both shows as well as the write-off of certain other capitalized program development projects. The remaining increase was due to higher network affiliate fees of $27 million and $7 million of higher amortization of license fees primarily related to airing higher cost feature presentations on WGN America.\nDirect operating expenses, which represented 21% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 20% for the year ended December 31, 2016, were essentially flat as a $2 million increase in compensation expense at Television and Entertainment was mostly offset by declines in other direct operating expenses.\nSG&A expenses, which represented 31% of revenues for year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 32% for the year ended December 31, 2016, decreased 8%, or $47 million, due mainly to lower other expenses and outside services expense. Outside services expense decreased 6%, or $5 million, driven by a $12 million decrease in professional fees primarily related to technology, a $3 million decrease in costs for operating websites and a $3 million decrease in costs associated with real estate sold in 2016, partially offset by a $14 million increase in professional and legal fees primarily associated with the terminated Sinclair Merger. Other expenses decreased 16%, or $39 million, primarily due to a $9 million decline in promotion expense, a $13 million decline in real estate impairment charges, a $5 million decline in outside national sales representative commissions, a $2 million decrease in bad debt write-offs, and a $9 million decrease in real estate taxes and other costs associated with real estate sold in 2016. Additionally, 2016 included non-cash impairment charges of $3 million related to the impairment of FCC licenses at two of our television stations.\nGain on sales of real estate, net of $29 million for 2017 primarily related to the sales of our properties in Costa Mesa, CA and Ft. Lauderdale, FL.\nDepreciation expense fell 4%, or $3 million, in 2017. The decrease is primarily due to lower levels of depreciable property. Amortization expense remained flat in 2017.\nIncome (Loss) From Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes-The results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 include the operating results of the Digital and Data businesses included in the Gracenote Sale. Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes in 2017 totaled $14 million, including a pretax gain on the sale of $33 million, compared to a loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in 2016 of $73 million. Interest expense allocated to discontinued operations totaled $1 million and $15 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The results of discontinued operations also include transaction costs, including legal and professional fees, incurred by us to complete the Gracenote Sale, of $10 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information.\nTELEVISION AND ENTERTAINMENT\nOperating Revenues and Profit-Television and Entertainment operating revenues include advertising revenues, retransmission revenues, carriage fees, barter/trade revenues and other revenues. The following table presents Television and Entertainment operating revenues, operating expenses and operating profit (in thousands):\n\n \n * Represents positive or negative change in excess of 100%  (1) Barter revenues are no longer recognized under the new revenue guidance adopted in 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, barter revenue totaled $28 million and $30 million, respectively. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method.\n2018 compared to 2017\nTelevision and Entertainment operating revenues increased 9%, or $163 million, in 2018 largely due to increases in advertising revenues, retransmission revenues, carriage fees and other revenue partially offset by the absence of barter revenue, as further described below.\nTelevision and Entertainment operating profit increased $387 million to $583 million in 2018 compared to $196 million in 2017. The increase was due primarily to a $163 million increase in operating revenues, a net pretax gain of $133 million in 2018 related to licenses sold in the FCC spectrum auction and a $115 million decrease in programming expenses, partially offset by higher compensation expense and other expense, as further described below.\n2017 compared to 2016\nTelevision and Entertainment operating revenues decreased 4%, or $74 million, in 2017 due largely to a decrease in advertising and other revenue, partially offset by an increase in retransmission revenues and carriage fees, as further described below.\nTelevision and Entertainment operating profit decreased $129 million to $196 million in 2017 compared to $325 million in 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a $74 million decline in operating revenues and an $88 million increase in programming expenses, mainly from a $43 million increase in program impairment charges, higher network affiliate fees and additional expense related to the shift in programming strategy at WGN America, partially offset by a $26 million decrease in other expenses and a $6 million decrease in compensation expense, as further described below.\nOperating Revenues-Television and Entertainment operating revenues, by classification, were as follows (in thousands):\n\n2018 compared to 2017\nAdvertising Revenues-Advertising revenues, net of agency commissions, grew 7%, or $90 million, in 2018 primarily due to a $150 million increase in political advertising revenues that was partially offset by a $62 million decrease in core advertising revenues (comprised of local and national advertising, excluding political and digital). The decrease in core advertising revenue was primarily due to a reduction in inventory available for local and national spots due to political advertising, a decline in television advertising in certain of our markets, a decrease in revenues associated with airing the Super Bowl on 2 NBC-affiliated stations in 2018 compared to 14 FOX-affiliated stations in 2017 and the 2018 Winter Olympics, which negatively impacted the non-NBC affiliated stations' advertising revenues. Political advertising revenues, which are a component of total advertising revenues, were $172 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $22 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, as 2018 was an election year.\nRetransmission Revenues-Retransmission revenues increased 14%, or $59 million, in 2018 primarily due to a $74 million increase from higher rates included in retransmission consent renewals of our MVPD agreements, partially offset by a decrease in the number of subscribers.\nCarriage Fees-Carriage fees increased 26%, or $33 million, in 2018 primarily due to higher rates for the distribution of WGN America.\nBarter/Trade Revenues-Barter/trade revenues decreased 76%, or $28 million, in 2018 as barter revenues are no longer recognized under the new revenue guidance adopted in 2018. We recognized $28 million of barter revenue in 2017.\nOther Revenues-Other revenues are primarily derived from profit sharing, revenue on syndicated content and copyright royalties. Other revenues increased 28%, or $9 million, in 2018 mainly due to a $4 million increase in copyright royalties, $3 million of revenue for the broadcast of third party digital multicast network programming and $3 million of deferred revenue recognized related to spectrum sharing arrangements.\n2017 compared to 2016\nAdvertising Revenues-Advertising revenues, net of agency commissions, decreased 11%, or $149 million, in 2017 primarily due to a $115 million decrease in political advertising revenues and a $36 million decrease in core advertising revenues (comprised of local and national advertising, excluding political and digital), partially offset by a $2 million increase in digital revenues. The decrease in core advertising revenue was primarily due to a decline in market revenues, partially offset by an increase in revenues associated with airing the Super Bowl on 14 FOX-affiliated stations in 2017 compared to 6 CBS-affiliated stations in 2016. Political advertising revenues, which are a component of total advertising revenues, were $22 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $137 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 as 2016 was a presidential election year.\nRetransmission Revenues-Retransmission revenues increased 23%, or $78 million, in 2017 primarily due to a $76 million increase from higher rates included in retransmission consent renewals of our MVPD agreements, partially offset by a decrease in the number of subscribers. Additionally, 2016 was negatively impacted due to the blackout of our stations by DISH network from June 12, 2016 to September 3, 2016.\nCarriage Fees-Carriage fees increased 6%, or $7 million, in 2017 due mainly to a $9 million increase from higher rates for the distribution of WGN America, partially offset by a decline in the number of subscribers.\nBarter/Trade Revenues-Barter/trade revenues decreased 4%, or $2 million, in 2017.\nOther Revenues-Other revenues are primarily derived from profit sharing, revenue on syndicated content and copyright royalties. Other revenues decreased 21%, or $9 million, in 2017 due primarily to 2016 including profit sharing from original programming that was cancelled.\nOperating Expenses-Television and Entertainment operating expenses for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands):\n ", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report, including Item 1. Business,\u201d Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and our audited consolidated financial statements for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 and notes thereto included in this Annual Report.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and other factors described throughout this Annual Report and particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nIntroduction\nThe following discussion and analysis compares our and our subsidiaries' results of operations for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018. As a result of the Gracenote Sale in 2017 (as further described below), the historical results of operations for the businesses included in the Gracenote Sale are reported as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Accordingly, all references made to financial data in this Annual Report are to Tribune Media Company's continuing operations, unless specifically noted.\nOverview\nWe are a diversified media and entertainment company comprised of 42 local television stations, which we refer to as our television stations,\u201d that are either owned by us or owned by others, but to which we provide certain services, along with a national general entertainment cable network, a radio station, a portfolio of real estate assets and investments in a variety of media, websites and other related assets.\nAs further described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements, on December 19, 2016, we entered into the Gracenote SPA with Nielsen to sell our equity interest in substantially all of the Digital and Data business as part of the transaction, which was completed on January 31, 2017. Prior to the Gracenote Sale, we reported our operations through the Television and Entertainment and Digital and Data reportable segments. Our Digital and Data segment consisted of several businesses driven by our expertise in collection, creation and distribution of data and innovation in unique services and recognition technology that used data, including Gracenote Video, Gracenote Music and Gracenote Sports. In accordance with ASU 2014-08, the results of operations of Digital and Data businesses included in the Gracenote Sale are reported as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nOur business consists of our Television and Entertainment operations and the management of certain of our real estate assets. As of December 31, 2018, we also held a variety of investments, including an equity method investment in TV Food Network, which provides substantial annual cash distributions, and an investment in CEV LLC, which was sold on January 22, 2019. Prior to the sale of our ownership interest on September 13, 2018, we also held an equity investment in CareerBuilder.\nTelevision and Entertainment is a reportable segment which provides audiences across the country with news, entertainment and sports programming on Tribune Broadcasting local television stations and distinctive, high quality television series and movies on WGN America as well as news, entertainment and sports information via our websites and other digital assets. Television and Entertainment includes 42 local television stations and related websites, including 39 owned stations and 3 stations to which we provide certain services (the SSAs\u201d) with Dreamcatcher; WGN America, a national general entertainment cable network; Antenna TV and THIS TV, national multicast networks; and WGN-AM, a radio station in Chicago. The television stations, including the 3 stations owned by Dreamcatcher (a fully-consolidated VIE), are comprised of 14 FOX television affiliates; 12 CW television\naffiliates; 6 CBS television affiliates; 3 ABC television affiliates; 3 MY television affiliates; 2 NBC television affiliates; and 2 independent television stations.\nIn addition, we report and include under Corporate and Other the management of certain of our real estate assets, including revenues from leasing our owned office and production facilities and any gains or losses from the sales of our owned real estate, as well as certain administrative activities associated with operating corporate office functions.\nTelevision and Entertainment represented 99% of our consolidated operating revenues in 2018. Approximately 66% of these revenues came from the sale of advertising spots. Changes in advertising revenues are heavily correlated with and influenced by changes in the level of economic activity and the demand for political advertising spots in the United States. Changes in gross domestic product, consumer spending levels, auto sales, political advertising levels, programming content, audience share, and rates all impact demand for advertising on our television stations. Our advertising revenues are subject to changes in these factors both on a national level and on a local level in the markets in which we operate. Television and Entertainment operating revenues also included retransmission revenues and carriage fees, which represented approximately 24% and 8%, respectively, of Television and Entertainment's 2018 total operating revenues.\nSignificant expense categories for Television and Entertainment include compensation expense, programming expense, depreciation expense, amortization expense, primarily resulting from the adoption of fresh-start reporting on the Effective Date (as defined below), and other expenses. Compensation expense represented 36% of Television and Entertainment's 2018 total operating expenses before the gain on sales of spectrum and is impacted by many factors, including the number of full-time equivalent employees, changes in the design and costs of the various employee benefit plans, the level of pay increases and our actions to reduce staffing levels. Programming expense represented 32% of Television and Entertainment's 2018 total operating expenses before the gain on sales of spectrum. The level of programming expense is affected by the cost of programs available for purchase and the selection of programs aired by our television stations. Depreciation expense and amortization expense represented 3% and 11% of Television and Entertainment's 2018 total operating expenses, respectively, before the gain on sales of spectrum. Other expenses represented 18% of Television and Entertainment's 2018 total operating expenses before the gain on sales of spectrum and are principally for sales and marketing activities, occupancy costs and other station operating expenses.\nWe use operating revenues and operating profit as ways to measure the financial performance of our business segments. In addition, we use audience and revenue share for our television stations, together with other factors, to measure our Television and Entertainment market shares and performance.\nOur results of operations, when examined on a quarterly basis, reflect the historical seasonality of our advertising revenues. Typically, second and fourth quarter advertising revenues are higher than first and third quarter advertising revenues. Results for the second quarter usually reflect spring seasonal advertising, while the fourth quarter includes advertising related to the holiday season. In addition, our operating results are subject to fluctuations from political advertising as political spending is usually significantly higher in even numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections.\nSignificant Events\nNexstar Merger Agreement\nOn November 30, 2018, we entered into the Nexstar Merger Agreement, providing for the acquisition by Nexstar of all of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, by means of a merger of Nexstar Merger Sub with and into Tribune Media Company, with the Company surviving the Nexstar Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nexstar.\nIn the Nexstar Merger, each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Nexstar Merger (the Effective Time\u201d) (other than shares held by (i) any Tribune subsidiary, Nexstar or any Nexstar subsidiary or (ii) Tribune shareholders who have not voted in favor of adopting the Nexstar Merger\nAgreement and who have demanded and perfected (and not validly withdrawn or waived) their appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL) will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment of $46.50 in cash (the base merger consideration\u201d), plus, if the Nexstar Merger closes after August 31, 2019 (the Adjustment Date\u201d), an additional amount in cash equal to (a) (i) $0.009863 multiplied by (ii) the number of calendar days elapsed after Adjustment Date to and including the date on which the Nexstar Merger closes, minus (b) the amount of any dividends declared by us after the Adjustment Date with a record date prior to the date on which the Nexstar Merger closes, in each case, without interest and less any required withholding taxes (the additional per share consideration\u201d, and together with the base merger consideration, the Nexstar Merger Consideration\u201d). The additional per share consideration will not be less than zero.\nEach option to purchase shares of Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, for each share of Common Stock subject to such stock option, a cash payment equal to the excess, if any, of the value of the Nexstar Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such stock option, without any interest and subject to all applicable withholding. Any stock option that has an exercise price per share that is greater than or equal to the Nexstar Merger Consideration will be cancelled for no consideration or payment. Each award of restricted stock units outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, will immediately vest and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of the total number of shares of Common Stock underlying such restricted stock unit multiplied by the Nexstar Merger Consideration, without any interest and subject to all applicable withholding (the RSU Consideration\u201d), except that each award of restricted stock units granted to an employee on or after December 1, 2018 (other than restricted stock units required to be granted pursuant to employment agreements or offer letters) ( Annual Tribune RSUs\u201d) that has vested as of the Effective Time of the Nexstar Merger will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the RSU Consideration and any Annual Tribune RSUs that remain unvested as of the Effective Time of the Nexstar Merger will be cancelled for no consideration or payment. Each award of performance stock units outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, will immediately vest (with performance conditions for each open performance period as of the closing date deemed achieved at the applicable target\u201d level performance for such performance stock units) and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of the total number of shares of Common Stock underlying such performance stock units multiplied by the Nexstar Merger Consideration, without any interest and subject to all applicable withholding. Each outstanding award of deferred stock units outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of the total number of shares of Common Stock underlying such deferred stock units multiplied by the Nexstar Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to all applicable withholding. Each unexercised warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be assumed by Nexstar and converted into a warrant exercisable for the Nexstar Merger Consideration which the shares of Common Stock underlying such warrant would have been entitled to receive upon consummation of the Nexstar Merger and otherwise upon the same terms and conditions of such warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time.\nThe consummation of the Nexstar Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions, including, among others: (i) the adoption of the Nexstar Merger by holders of a majority of our outstanding Common Stock, (ii) the receipt of approval from the FCC and the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the Nexstar Merger under the HSR Act and (iii) the absence of any order or law of any governmental authority that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Nexstar Merger. Our and Nexstar's respective obligations to consummate the Nexstar Merger are also subject to certain additional customary conditions, including (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (generally subject to a material adverse effect\u201d standard), (ii) performance by the other party of its covenants in the Nexstar Merger Agreement in all material respects and (iii) with respect to Nexstar's obligation to consummate the Nexstar Merger, since the date of the Nexstar Merger Agreement, no material adverse effect with respect to Tribune having occurred.\nThe applications for FCC Approval were filed on January 7, 2019. On February 14, 2019, the FCC issued a public notice of filing of the applications which set deadlines for petitions to deny the applications, oppositions to petitions to deny and replies to oppositions to petitions to deny.\nOn February 7, 2019, we received a request for additional information and documentary material, often referred to as a second request,\u201d from the DOJ in connection with the Nexstar Merger Agreement. The second request was issued under the HSR Act. Nexstar received a substantively identical request for additional information and documentary material from the DOJ in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Nexstar Merger Agreement. Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Nexstar Merger Agreement is conditioned on expiration of the waiting period applicable under the HSR Act, among other conditions. Issuance of the second request extends the waiting period under the HSR Act until 30 days after Nexstar and the Company have substantially complied with the second request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the DOJ or the parties voluntarily extend the time for closing.\nThe Nexstar Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time: (i) by mutual written consent of Nexstar and us; (ii) by either Nexstar or us (a) if the Effective Time has not occurred on or before November 30, 2019, provided that (x) if, on the initial end date, any of the conditions to the consummation of the Nexstar Merger related to the HSR Approval or the FCC Approval have not been satisfied, but all other conditions the consummation of the Nexstar Merger have been satisfied or waived or capable of being satisfied, then the end date will be automatically extended to February 29, 2020 and (y) in the event the marketing period for the debt financing for the transaction has commenced but has not completed by the end date, the end date may be extended (or further extended) by Nexstar on one occasion in its sole discretion by providing written notice thereof to us at least one business day prior to the end date until the date that is four business days after the last scheduled expiration date of the marketing period (unless the failure of the Effective Time to occur before the end date was primarily due to such party's breach of any of its obligations under the Nexstar Merger Agreement), (b) if any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction has issued an order permanently prohibiting the consummation of the Nexstar Merger and such order has become final and non-appealable (unless such order was primarily attributable to such party's breach of the Nexstar Merger Agreement), or (c) if, after completion of the special meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof), our shareholders have not approved the adoption of the Nexstar Merger Agreement; and (iii) either Nexstar or us in certain circumstances, as described in the Nexstar Merger Agreement.\nWe must pay Nexstar a termination fee of $135 million if Nexstar terminates the Nexstar Merger Agreement due to (a) our board or any committee thereof (i) withdrawing, rescinding, amending, changing, modifying or qualifying, or otherwise proposing publicly to take any of the foregoing actions in a manner adverse to Nexstar, its recommendation that our shareholders adopt the Nexstar Merger Agreement, (ii) failing to make such recommendation in our proxy statement, (iii) adopting, approving or recommending, or otherwise proposing publicly to adopt, approve or recommend, an alternative acquisition proposal, (iv) failing to publicly recommend against an alternative acquisition proposal that has been publicly disclosed within ten business days of Nexstar's request and failing to reaffirm its recommendation within such period upon such request (provided that such a request may be delivered by Nexstar only once with respect to each alternative acquisition proposal, with the right to make an additional request with respect to each subsequent material amendment or modification thereto), or (v) taking any action to make the provisions of any fair price,\u201d moratorium,\u201d control share acquisition,\u201d business combination\u201d or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation inapplicable to any transaction other than the transactions contemplated by the Nexstar Merger Agreement; (b) we or any of our subsidiaries having entered into any agreement, other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement, with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal; or (c) we terminate the Nexstar Merger Agreement due to our board authorizing us to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement.\nAs further described in the Nexstar Merger Agreement, we must pay Nexstar a termination fee of $135 million (except that the termination fee of $135 million will be reduced by any previously paid amounts relating to the documented, out-of-pocket expenses of Nexstar in an amount not to exceed $15 million) if: (a) we or Nexstar terminate the Nexstar Merger Agreement if the Effective Time has not occurred prior to the end date of November 30, 2019, subject to an automatic extension to February 29, 2020 in certain circumstances if the only outstanding\nunfulfilled conditions relate to HSR Approval or FCC Approval (and an additional extension, at Nexstar's election, if the marketing period for the debt financing for the transaction has not ended by the end date); (b) we or Nexstar terminate the Nexstar Merger Agreement if, after completion of the special meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof), our shareholders have not approved the adoption of the Nexstar Merger Agreement; or (c) Nexstar terminates the Nexstar Merger Agreement in respect of a willful breach of our covenants or agreements that would give rise to the failure of a closing condition that is incapable of being cured within a specified time period, and, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses, an alternative acquisition proposal has been made to us and publicly announced or otherwise disclosed and has not been withdrawn prior to the termination of the Nexstar Merger Agreement, the date of the special meeting (in the case of a termination for failure to obtain approval of the adoption of the Nexstar Merger Agreement by our shareholders) or the date of the applicable breach giving rise to termination, as applicable, and within twelve months after termination of the Nexstar Merger Agreement, we enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal (and subsequently consummates such transaction) or consummates a transaction with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal.\nWe must pay Nexstar the documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Nexstar in an amount not to exceed $15 million if we or Nexstar terminate the Nexstar Merger Agreement because our shareholders do not approve the transaction.\nTermination of Sinclair Merger Agreement\nOn May 8, 2017, we entered into the Sinclair Merger Agreement with Sinclair, providing for the acquisition by Sinclair of all of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock by means of a merger of Samson Merger Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Sinclair, with and into Tribune Media Company, with Tribune Media Company surviving the Sinclair Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Sinclair.\nThe consummation of the Sinclair Merger was subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain important conditions, including, among others: the receipt of approval from the FCC and the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the Sinclair Merger under the HSR Act. Pursuant to the Sinclair Merger Agreement, we had the right to terminate the Sinclair Merger Agreement if Sinclair failed to perform in all material respects its covenants, and such failure was not cured by the end date of August 8, 2018. Additionally, either party could terminate the Sinclair Merger Agreement if the Sinclair Merger was not consummated on or before August 8, 2018 (and the failure for the Sinclair Merger to have been consummated by such date was not primarily due to a breach of the Sinclair Merger Agreement by the party terminating the Sinclair Merger Agreement). On August 9, 2018, we provided notification to Sinclair that we had terminated the Sinclair Merger Agreement, effective immediately, on the basis of Sinclair's willful and material breaches of its covenants and the expiration of the end date thereunder. Additionally, on August 9, 2018, we filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Sinclair (the Complaint\u201d), alleging that Sinclair willfully and materially breached its obligations under the Sinclair Merger Agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain regulatory approval of the Sinclair Merger so as to enable the Sinclair Merger to close as soon as reasonably practicable. The lawsuit seeks damages for all losses incurred as a result of Sinclair's breach of contract under the Sinclair Merger Agreement. On August 29, 2018, Sinclair filed an answer to our Complaint and a counterclaim (the Counterclaim\u201d). The Counterclaim alleges that we materially and willfully breached the Sinclair Merger Agreement by failing to use reasonable best efforts to obtain regulatory approval of the Sinclair Merger. On September 18, 2018, we filed an answer to the Counterclaim. We believe the Counterclaim is without merit and intend to defend it vigorously.\nOn May 8, 2018, we, Sinclair Television Group, Inc. ( Sinclair Television\u201d) and Fox Television Stations, LLC ( Fox\u201d) entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Fox Purchase Agreement\u201d) to sell the assets of seven network affiliates for $910 million in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments. The network affiliates subject to the Fox Purchase Agreement were: KCPQ (Tacoma, WA); KDVR (Denver, CO); KSTU (Salt Lake City, UT); KSWB-TV (San Diego, CA); KTXL (Sacramento, CA); WJW (Cleveland, OH); and WSFL-TV (Miami, FL). In connection with the termination of the Sinclair Merger Agreement on August 9, 2018, we provided notification to Fox that we terminated the Fox Purchase Agreement, effective immediately. Under the terms of the Fox Purchase Agreement, no termination fees were payable by any party.\nTax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Reform\u201d) was signed into law. Under ASC Topic 740, the effects of Tax Reform are recognized in the period of enactment and as such were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Consistent with the guidance under ASC Topic 740, and subject to Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB\u201d) 118, which provides for a measurement period to complete the accounting for certain elements of Tax Reform, we recorded the provisional impact from the enactment of Tax Reform in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result of Tax Reform, we recorded a provisional discrete net tax benefit of $256 million, primarily due to a remeasurement of the net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In 2018, we completed the accounting for income tax effects of Tax Reform and recorded an additional income tax benefit of $24 million to the net deferred tax liabilities, primarily resulting from return to provision adjustments which have the effect of adjusting the provisional discrete net tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. The tax benefit was recorded as the result of new information, including higher than expected pension contributions and new filing positions reported in the Company's income tax returns as they became due. While we consider the income tax accounting related to Tax Reform to be complete, we continue to evaluate new guidance and tax legislation as it is issued. Tax Reform also provided for a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) through the year ended December 31, 2017. We do not have any net accumulated E&P in our foreign subsidiaries and therefore are not subject to tax for the year ended December 31, 2017. Further, we have analyzed the effects of new taxes due on certain foreign income, such as global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d), base-erosion anti-abuse tax ( BEAT\u201d), foreign-derived intangible income ( FDII\u201d) and limitations on interest expense deductions (if certain conditions apply) that are effective starting in fiscal 2018. We have determined that these new provisions are not applicable to us.\nMonetization of Real Estate Assets\nIn the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, we sold several properties for net pretax proceeds totaling $59 million, $144 million and $506 million, respectively, and recognized a net pretax gain of $25 million, $29 million and $213 million, respectively. We define net proceeds as pretax cash proceeds on the sale of properties, net of associated selling costs. See Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements for details on real estate sales for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018.\nFCC Spectrum Auction\nOn April 13, 2017, the FCC announced the conclusion of the incentive auction, the results of the reverse and forward auction and the repacking of broadcast television spectrum. We participated in the auction and have received approximately $191 million in pretax proceeds (including $26 million of proceeds received by a Dreamcatcher station) as of December 31, 2017. The proceeds reflect the FCC's acceptance of one or more bids placed by us or channel share partners of television stations owned or operated by us during the auction to modify and/or surrender spectrum used by certain of such bidder's television stations. We used $102 million of after-tax proceeds to prepay a portion of our Term Loan Facility. After-tax proceeds of $12.6 million received by a Dreamcatcher station were used to prepay a substantial portion of the Dreamcatcher Credit Facility. FCC licenses with a carrying value of $39 million were included in assets held for sale as of December 31, 2017. In 2017, we received $172 million in gross pretax proceeds for these licenses as part of the FCC spectrum auction, and in the\nfirst quarter of 2018, we recognized a net pretax gain of $133 million related to the surrender of the spectrum of these television stations in January 2018. In 2017, we also received $84 million of pretax proceeds for sharing arrangements whereby we will provide hosting services to the counterparties. Additionally, we paid $66 million of proceeds in 2017 to counterparties who will host certain of our television stations under sharing arrangements.\nTwenty-two of our television stations (including WTTK, which operates as a satellite station of WTTV) are required to change frequencies or otherwise modify their operations as a result of the repacking, as further described in Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements. In doing so, the stations could incur substantial conversion costs, reduction or loss of over-the-air signal coverage or an inability to provide high definition programming and additional program streams. The legislation authorizing the incentive auction provides the FCC with a $1.750 billion special fund to reimburse reasonable capital costs and expenses incurred by stations that are reassigned to new channels in the repacking, which amount was increased by $1 billion pursuant to the adoption of an amended version of the Repack Airwaves Yielding Better Access for Users of Modern Services (RAY BAUM'S) Act of 2018 by the U.S. Congress on March 23, 2018. A majority of our capital expenditures for the FCC spectrum repacking occurred in 2018 and are expected to occur in 2019. Through December 31, 2018, we incurred $27 million in capital expenditures for the spectrum repack, of which $24 million were incurred in 2018. We received FCC reimbursements of $11 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The reimbursements are included as a reduction to SG&A expense in our audited Consolidated Statement of Operations and are presented as an investing inflow in our audited Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We expect that the reimbursements from the FCC's special fund will cover the majority of our capital costs and expenses related to the repacking. However, we cannot currently predict the effect of the repacking, whether the special fund will be sufficient to reimburse all of our expenses related to the repacking, the timing of reimbursements or any spectrum-related FCC regulatory action.\nChapter 11 Reorganization\nOn December 8, 2008 (the Petition Date\u201d) the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief (collectively, the Chapter 11 Petitions\u201d) under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. As further defined and described in Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements, a plan of reorganization for the Debtors became effective and the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11 on December 31, 2012. The Bankruptcy Court has entered final decrees that have collectively closed 106 of the Debtors' Chapter 11 cases. The remaining Debtors' Chapter 11 proceedings continue to be jointly administered under the caption In re: Tribune Media Company, et al., Case No.08-13141.\nFrom the Petition Date and until the Effective Date, the Debtors operated their businesses as debtors-in-possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and applicable orders of the Bankruptcy Court. In general, as debtors-in-possession, the Debtors were authorized under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to continue to operate as ongoing businesses, but could not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court.\nOn the Effective Date, all of the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied or waived, the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11, and the settlements, agreements and transactions contemplated by the Plan to be effected on the Effective Date were implemented, including, among other things, the appointment of a new board of directors and the initiation of distributions to creditors. As a result, our ownership changed from the ESOP to certain of our creditors on the Effective Date. On January 17, 2013, our Board of Directors appointed a chairman of the board and a new chief executive officer. Such appointments were effective immediately.\nSince the Effective Date, we have substantially consummated the various transactions contemplated under the Plan. In particular, we have made all distributions of cash, Common Stock and Warrants that were required to be made under the terms of the Plan to creditors holding allowed claims as of December 31, 2012. Claims of general unsecured creditors that become allowed claims on or after the Effective Date have been or will be paid on the next quarterly distribution date after such allowance. At December 31, 2018, restricted cash and cash equivalents held by us to satisfy the remaining claims obligations was $17 million and is estimated to be sufficient to satisfy such\nobligations. If the aggregate allowed amount of the remaining claims exceeds the restricted cash and cash equivalents held for satisfying such claims, we will be required to satisfy the allowed claims from our cash on hand from operations. See Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Chapter 11 proceedings.\nChicago Cubs Transactions\nAs further described in Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements, we consummated the closing of the Chicago Cubs Transactions on October 27, 2009. As a result of these transactions, NEH owned 95% and we owned 5% of the membership interests in CEV LLC. The fair market value of the contributed assets exceeded the tax basis and did not result in an immediate taxable gain because the transaction was structured to comply with the partnership provisions of the IRC and related regulations. On June 28, 2016, the IRS issued to us a Notice of Deficiency ( Notice\u201d) which presents the IRS's position that the gain should have been included in our 2009 taxable income. Accordingly, the IRS has proposed a $182 million tax and a $73 million gross valuation misstatement penalty. In addition, after-tax interest on the aforementioned proposed tax and penalty through December 31, 2018 would be approximately $81 million. We continue to disagree with the IRS's position that the transaction generated a taxable gain in 2009, the proposed penalty and the IRS's calculation of the gain. During the third quarter of 2016, we filed a petition in U.S. Tax Court to contest the IRS's determination. We continue to pursue resolution of this disputed tax matter with the IRS. If the IRS prevails in their position, the gain on the Chicago Cubs Transactions would be deemed to be taxable in 2009. We estimate that the federal and state income taxes would be approximately $225 million before interest and penalties. Any tax, interest and penalty due will be offset by tax payments made relating to this transaction subsequent to 2009. As of December 31, 2018, we have paid or accrued approximately $80 million of federal and state tax payments through our regular tax reporting process. We do not maintain any tax reserves relating to the Chicago Cubs Transactions. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 include a deferred tax liability of $69 million and $96 million, respectively, related to the future recognition of taxable income related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions.\nOn August 21, 2018, NEH provided the Call Notice to us that NEH was exercising its right to purchase our 5% membership interest in CEV LLC. We sold our 5% ownership interest in CEV LLC on January 22, 2019 and received pretax proceeds of $107.5 million. We expect to recognize a pretax gain of $86 million in the first quarter of 2019. As a result of the sale, the total remaining deferred tax liability of $69 million will become currently payable in 2019. The sale of our ownership interest in CEV LLC has no impact on our dispute with the IRS.\nEmployee Reductions\nWe recorded pretax charges, mainly consisting of employee severance costs, associated termination benefits and related expenses totaling $7 million, $5 million and $10 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These charges are included in direct operating expenses or SG&A expense, as appropriate, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table summarizes these severance and related charges included in income from continuing operations by business segment (in thousands):\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Television and Entertainment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>(398\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe accrued liability for severance and related expenses was $7 million and $5 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nNon-Operating Items\nNon-operating items were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishments and modification of debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20,487\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) gain on investment transactions, net\n</td> <td>(1,113\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Write-downs of investments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(193,494\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-operating gain, net\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-operating (loss) gain, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,045\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(205,779\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-operating items for 2018 included a pretax loss of $5 million from the sale of our remaining ownership interest in CareerBuilder and a pretax gain of $4 million from the sale of one of our other equity investments.\nNon-operating items for 2017 included a $20 million pretax loss on the extinguishments and modification of debt. The loss included a write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $7 million and an unamortized discount of $2 million as a portion of the Term Loan Facility was considered extinguished for accounting purposes as well as an expense of $12 million of third party fees as a portion of the Term Loan Facility was considered a modification transaction under ASC 470, Debt.\u201d (Loss) gain on investment transactions, net included a pretax gain of $5 million from the sale of our Tribune Publishing shares and a pretax gain of $4 million from the partial sale of CareerBuilder. Write-downs of investments included non-cash pretax impairment charges of $193 million to write down our investments in CareerBuilder and Dose Media, LLC ( Dose Media\u201d) and one of our other equity investments (as further described in Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements).\nNon-operating items for 2016 included a $5 million non-cash favorable workers' compensation reserve adjustment related to businesses divested by us in prior years.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion of our annual results of operations only relates to our continuing operations, unless otherwise noted.\nAs described previously, on December 19, 2016, we entered into the Gracenote SPA with Nielsen to sell our equity interest in substantially all of the Digital and Data business. As a result, the historical results of operations for the businesses included in the Gracenote Sale are reported in discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Television and Entertainment reportable segment includes the operations of Covers, a sports betting information website, which was previously included in the Digital and Data reportable segment. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation; the impact of this reclassification was immaterial.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( Topic 606\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2014-09 created Topic 606 and superseded the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.\u201d We adopted the new revenue guidance in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of December 31, 2017. Results for reporting periods prior to adoption continue to be presented in accordance with our historical accounting under Topic 605. The only identified impact to our financial statements relates to barter revenue and expense as well as barter-related broadcast rights and contracts payable for broadcast rights, which are no longer recognized.\nFor the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2018\nCONSOLIDATED\nConsolidated operating results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are shown in the table below (in thousands).\nTable 136:

operating revenues increased 9%, or $161 million, in 2018 primarily due to an increase of $163 million in Television and Entertainment revenues driven by higher advertising revenue, retransmission revenues and carriage fees, partially offset by the absence of barter revenue due to the new revenue guidance adopted in 2018. Consolidated operating profit was $488 million in 2018 compared to $86 million in 2017, representing an increase of $403 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher Television and Entertainment operating profit largely due to a net pretax gain of $133 million related to licenses sold in the FCC spectrum auction, an increase in revenue and lower programming expenses as well as a lower Corporate and Other operating loss primarily due to a decrease in compensation, other expenses and depreciation. Programming expenses included a program impairment charge of $28 million for the syndicated program Elementary at WGN America in 2018 compared to a program impairment charge of $80 million in 2017 for the syndicated programs Elementary and Person of Interest at WGN America.\n2017 compared to 2016\nConsolidated operating revenues decreased 5%, or $99 million, in 2017 primarily due to a decrease of $74 million in Television and Entertainment revenues driven by lower advertising and other revenue, partially offset by higher retransmission revenue and carriage fees. Additionally, Corporate and Other revenues declined by $24 million primarily due to the loss of revenue from real estate properties sold in 2016 and 2017. Consolidated operating profit was $86 million in 2017 compared to $409 million in 2016, representing a decrease of $323 million primarily due to a $185 million decline in gains recorded on the sales of real estate from $213 million in 2016 to $29 million in 2017 and lower Television and Entertainment operating profit. Television and Entertainment operating profit decreased due to lower revenues and higher programming expenses partly resulting from a $43 million increase in program impairment charges. Programming expenses included a program impairment charge of $80 million for the syndicated programs Elementary and Person of Interest at WGN America in 2017 compared to a program impairment charge of $37 million in 2016 for the syndicated program Elementary at WGN America.\nOperating Expenses-Consolidated operating expenses were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18-17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17-16\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Programming\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>489,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>604,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>515,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-19\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+17\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>401,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>390,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>567,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>620,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>54,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization\n</td> <td>166,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of spectrum\n</td> <td>(133,197\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of real estate, net\n</td> <td>(24,657\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,533\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(213,086\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-87\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,521,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,763,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,539,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n * Represents positive or negative change in excess of 100%  2018 compared to 2017\nProgramming expenses, which represented 24% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 33% for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased 19%, or $115 million, due largely to the $51 million decrease in program impairment charges described above as well as lower amortization of license fees, the absence of barter expense in 2018 and a total of $19 million of additional expense in 2017 related to a shift in programming strategy at WGN America in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher network affiliate fees. The decrease in amortization of license fees of $73 million was primarily attributable to three originals airing in the first half of 2017 (Outsiders, Underground and Salem) versus airing lower cost programming in 2018. Barter expense decreased $28 million as we no longer recognize barter revenue and expense as a result of adopting new revenue guidance in 2018. Network affiliate fees increased by $59 million mainly due to the renewal of network affiliation agreements in eight markets with FOX during the third quarter of 2018, along with other contractual increases.\nDirect operating expenses, which represented 20% of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 21% for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased 2%, or $10 million, due mainly to increases in compensation and outside services expense. Compensation expense increased $5 million due to higher direct pay and benefits. Outside services expense increased $4 million primarily due to costs associated with spectrum sharing arrangements and costs for operating websites.\nSG&A expenses, which represented 28% of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 31% for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased 1%, or $5 million, primarily due to lower compensation and other expenses, partially offset by an increase in outside services expense. Compensation expense decreased 1%, or $4\nmillion, due to a $13 million decline at Corporate and Other, partially offset by a $10 million increase at Television & Entertainment. The decline at Corporate and Other was primarily due to the prior year expense of $13 million ($6 million of severance and $7 million of stock-based compensation) related to the resignation of the CEO in the first quarter of 2017. In addition, direct pay and benefits decreased by $1 million and severance decreased by $1 million, offset by a $2 million increase in retention bonuses ($9 million in 2018 compared to $7 million in 2017). Compensation expense increased $10 million at Television & Entertainment due to a $9 million increase in incentive compensation, a $4 million increase in retention bonuses ($5 million in 2018 compared to $1 million in 2017) and a $3 million increase in severance, partially offset by a $6 million decrease in direct pay and benefits and a $1 million decrease in stock-based compensation. Other expenses decreased 2%, or $4 million, as the receipt of $11 million of spectrum repack reimbursements, a $2 million decrease in rent expense and a $1 million decrease in promotion expense were partially offset by a $5 million increase in outside national sales representative commissions, $4 million of costs related to a litigation reserve and a non-cash impairment charge of $3 million related to the impairment of an FCC license at one of our television stations in 2018. Outside services expense increased 2%, or $2 million, driven by higher professional and legal fees.\nGain on sales of real estate, net of $25 million for 2018 related to the sales of our properties in Melville, NY and Hartford, CT, as further described in Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation expense fell 4%, or $2 million, in 2018. Amortization expense remained flat in 2018.\nGain on sales of spectrum of $133 million for 2018 relates to licenses sold in the FCC spectrum auction for which the spectrum of these television stations was surrendered in January 2018, as further described in Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\n2017 compared to 2016\nProgramming expenses, which represented 33% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 26% for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased 17%, or $88 million, due largely to a $43 million increase in program impairment charges and a total of $19 million of expense related to the shift in programming strategy at WGN America in the second quarter of 2017. This included cancellation costs for Outsiders and Underground and the associated accelerated amortization of remaining programming assets for both shows as well as the write-off of certain other capitalized program development projects. The remaining increase was due to higher network affiliate fees of $27 million and $7 million of higher amortization of license fees primarily related to airing higher cost feature presentations on WGN America.\nDirect operating expenses, which represented 21% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 20% for the year ended December 31, 2016, were essentially flat as a $2 million increase in compensation expense at Television and Entertainment was mostly offset by declines in other direct operating expenses.\nSG&A expenses, which represented 31% of revenues for year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 32% for the year ended December 31, 2016, decreased 8%, or $47 million, due mainly to lower other expenses and outside services expense. Outside services expense decreased 6%, or $5 million, driven by a $12 million decrease in professional fees primarily related to technology, a $3 million decrease in costs for operating websites and a $3 million decrease in costs associated with real estate sold in 2016, partially offset by a $14 million increase in professional and legal fees primarily associated with the terminated Sinclair Merger. Other expenses decreased 16%, or $39 million, primarily due to a $9 million decline in promotion expense, a $13 million decline in real estate impairment charges, a $5 million decline in outside national sales representative commissions, a $2 million decrease in bad debt write-offs, and a $9 million decrease in real estate taxes and other costs associated with real estate sold in 2016. Additionally, 2016 included non-cash impairment charges of $3 million related to the impairment of FCC licenses at two of our television stations.\nGain on sales of real estate, net of $29 million for 2017 primarily related to the sales of our properties in Costa Mesa, CA and Ft. Lauderdale, FL.\nDepreciation expense fell 4%, or $3 million, in 2017. The decrease is primarily due to lower levels of depreciable property. Amortization expense remained flat in 2017.\nIncome (Loss) From Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes-The results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 include the operating results of the Digital and Data businesses included in the Gracenote Sale. Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes in 2017 totaled $14 million, including a pretax gain on the sale of $33 million, compared to a loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in 2016 of $73 million. Interest expense allocated to discontinued operations totaled $1 million and $15 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The results of discontinued operations also include transaction costs, including legal and professional fees, incurred by us to complete the Gracenote Sale, of $10 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

The decrease was due primarily to a $74 million decline in operating revenues and an $88 million increase in programming expenses, mainly from a $43 million increase in program impairment charges, higher network affiliate fees and additional expense related to the shift in programming strategy at WGN America, partially offset by a $26 million decrease in other expenses and a $6 million decrease in compensation expense, as further described below.\nOperating Revenues-Television and Entertainment operating revenues, by classification, were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18-17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17-16\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,315,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,225,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,374,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retransmission revenues\n</td> <td>471,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>412,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Carriage fees\n</td> <td>161,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+26\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Barter/trade\n</td> <td>9,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-76\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>40,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+28\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-21\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,998,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,835,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,909,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 compared to 2017\nAdvertising Revenues-Advertising revenues, net of agency commissions, grew 7%, or $90 million, in 2018 primarily due to a $150 million increase in political advertising revenues that was partially offset by a $62 million decrease in core advertising revenues (comprised of local and national advertising, excluding political and digital). The decrease in core advertising revenue was primarily due to a reduction in inventory available for local and national spots due to political advertising, a decline in television advertising in certain of our markets, a decrease in revenues associated with airing the Super Bowl on 2 NBC-affiliated stations in 2018 compared to 14 FOX-affiliated stations in 2017 and the 2018 Winter Olympics, which negatively impacted the non-NBC affiliated stations' advertising revenues. Political advertising revenues, which are a component of total advertising revenues, were $172 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $22 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, as 2018 was an election year.\nRetransmission Revenues-Retransmission revenues increased 14%, or $59 million, in 2018 primarily due to a $74 million increase from higher rates included in retransmission consent renewals of our MVPD agreements, partially offset by a decrease in the number of subscribers.\nCarriage Fees-Carriage fees increased 26%, or $33 million, in 2018 primarily due to higher rates for the distribution of WGN America.\nBarter/Trade Revenues-Barter/trade revenues decreased 76%, or $28 million, in 2018 as barter revenues are no longer recognized under the new revenue guidance adopted in 2018. We recognized $28 million of barter revenue in 2017.\nOther Revenues-Other revenues are primarily derived from profit sharing, revenue on syndicated content and copyright royalties.
