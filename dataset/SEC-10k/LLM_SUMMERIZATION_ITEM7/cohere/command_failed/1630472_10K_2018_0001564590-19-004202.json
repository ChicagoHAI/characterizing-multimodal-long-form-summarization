Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those in this discussion as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Part, 1. Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nIntroduction\nWe are a commercial real estate finance company externally managed by TPG RE Finance Trust Management, L.P. and sponsored by TPG. We directly originate, acquire and manage commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate-related debt instruments in North America for our balance sheet. We operate our business as one segment.\nWe have made an election to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our initial taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We believe we have been organized and have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and we believe that our organization and current and intended manner of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. We operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain an exclusion or exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act.\n2018 Highlights\nOperating Results:\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Generated GAAP net income of $106.9 million, an increase of $12.6 million, or 13.3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Increased Core Earnings to $107.4 million, or $1.70 per share, an increase of $13.0 million, or 13.8%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Declared dividends of $109.1 million, or $1.71 per share, representing a dividend yield of 8.7% on a Book Value per Common Share of $19.76 as of December 31, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Portfolio Activity:\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Originated 26 loans with a total commitment of $2.52 billion, an initial unpaid principal balance of $2.09 billion, unfunded commitments upon closing of $436.2 million, and a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.6%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Funded $258.3 million in connection with existing loans having future funding obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Received cash proceeds of $1.2 billion from principal repayments, including $2.6 million from loan sales.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPortfolio Financing Activity:\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Closed two collateralized loan obligations totaling $1.9 billion, financing 51 existing first mortgage loan investments, comprising 48 pari passu participation interests and three whole loans, significantly reducing cost of funds and increasing non-recourse, matched-term financing of the loan portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Closed a non-recourse term loan facility of up to $750 million and established a $160 million secured credit agreement to table fund new loan investments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Raised gross proceeds of $138.7 million through an underwritten common stock offering of 7 million shares at a price of $19.82 per share.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAvailable Liquidity:\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> At December 31, 2018, we had unrestricted cash available for investment of $39.7 million, a portion of which is subject to certain liquidity covenants, and CMBS investments with an aggregate face amount of $76.4 million available for sale.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> At December 31, 2018, we had undrawn capacity (liquidity available to us without the need to pledge more collateral to our lenders) of $236.5 million under secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, and a term loan facility, with eight lenders:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $236.5 million of undrawn capacity in connection with our secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, and a term loan facility, with an aggregate maximum commitment amount of $4.0 billion and a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.0% as of December 31, 2018, providing stable financing, with mark-to-market provisions limited to asset and, in one instance, market specific events and a weighted average term to extended maturity (assuming we have exercised all extension options and term out provisions) of 3.4 years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2018, we had $2.6 billion of financing capacity under secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, and a term loan facility, provided by nine lenders.

For the three months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded earnings per share of $0.43, declared a dividend of $0.43 per share, and reported $0.43 per share of Core Earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded earnings per share of $1.70, declared dividends of $1.71 per share, and reported $1.70 per share of Core Earnings. In addition, our book value per common share as of December 31, 2018 was $19.76. As further described below, Core Earnings is a measure that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use Core Earnings to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan activity and operations.\nEarnings Per Common Share and Dividends Declared Per Common Share\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share and dividends declared per share (in thousands, except share and per share data):\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income Attributable to TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 106,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 94,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted Average Number of Common Shares\nOutstanding, Basic and Diluted(1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67,185,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,034,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,194,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic and Diluted Earnings per Common Share(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends Declared per Common Share(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Weighted average number of shares outstanding includes common stock and Class A common stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Share and per share data reflect the impact of the common stock and Class A common stock dividend which was paid upon completion of the Company's initial public offering on July 25, 2017 to holders of record as of July 3, 2017.

Core Earnings is a non-GAAP measure, which we define as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to our stockholders, including realized gains and losses not otherwise included in GAAP net income (loss), and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) unrealized gains (losses), and (iv) certain non-cash items. Core Earnings may also be adjusted from time to time to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash charges as determined by our Manager, subject to approval by a majority of our independent directors. The exclusion of depreciation and amortization from the calculation of Core Earnings only applies to debt investments related to real estate to the extent we foreclose upon the property or properties underlying such debt investments.\nWe believe that Core Earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to our net income and cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Although pursuant to the Management Agreement we calculate the incentive and base management fees due to our Manager using Core Earnings before incentive fee expense, we report Core Earnings after incentive fee expense, because we believe this is a more meaningful presentation of the economic performance of our common and Class A common stock.\nCore Earnings does not represent net income or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, or an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operations, a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. In addition, our methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and accordingly, our reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to the Core Earnings reported by other companies.\nFor additional information on the fees we pay our Manager, see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders to Core Earnings (in thousands, except share and per share data):\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 106,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 94,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-Cash Compensation Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and Amortization Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized Gains (Losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 107,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 94,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted-Average Common Shares Outstanding, Basic\nand Diluted(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67,185,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,034,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,194,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Earnings per Common Share, Basic and Diluted(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Represents GAAP net income attributable to our common and Class A common stockholders.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Share and per share data reflect the impact of the common stock and Class A common stock dividend which was paid upon completion of the Company's initial public offering on July 25, 2017 to holders of record as of July 3, 2017.

As of December 31, 2018, our CMBS portfolio consisted of four fixed rate securities, the underlying collateral of which consists of first mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate properties. The underlying real estate collateral is located across the United States, primarily in California and Texas, with no state representing more than 24.3% of an investment's current face amount. Additionally, the payment of principal and interest on the securities in our CMBS portfolio at December 31, 2018 is guaranteed by a U.S. Government agency or a U.S. government sponsored enterprise ( GSE\u201d). At December 31, 2018, there were no floating rate securities in our CMBS Portfolio.\nThe following table details overall statistics for our CMBS portfolio as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> CMBS Investment\nExposure\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of CMBS investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed rate CMBS investments (by current face amount)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Par value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 77,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current face amount(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average coupon(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average yield to expected maturity(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average life (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average principal repayment window (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual maturity (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Ratings(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Unrated\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Amounts disclosed are before giving effect to unamortized purchase price premium and discount and unrealized gains or losses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Weighted by market value as of December 31, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> The largest structured finance investment is 100% collateralized by multifamily mortgage loans underwritten by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( FHLMC\u201d), which loans are slated for near term securitization by FHLMC.

We are party to an agreement with Situs Asset Management, LLC ( Situs\u201d), one of the largest commercial mortgage loan servicers, pursuant to which Situs provides us with dedicated asset management employees for performing asset management services pursuant to our proprietary guidelines. Following the closing of an investment, this dedicated asset management team rigorously monitors the investment under our Manager's oversight, with an emphasis on ongoing financial, legal and quantitative analyses. Through the final repayment of an investment, the asset management team maintains regular contact with borrowers, servicers and local market experts monitoring performance of the collateral, anticipating borrower, property and market issues, and enforcing our rights and remedies when appropriate.\nOur Manager reviews our entire loan portfolio quarterly, undertakes an assessment of the performance of each loan, and assigns it a risk rating between 1\u201d and 5,\u201d from least risk to greatest risk, respectively. See Notes 2 and 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for a discussion regarding the risk rating system that we use in connection with our portfolio.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, we also had outstanding non-consolidated senior interests of $96.4 million.\nThe following table details our portfolio financing outstanding principal balances (dollars in thousands):\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Portfolio Financing\nOutstanding Principal Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collateralized loan obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,522,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Secured revolving repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,044,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,835,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior secured and secured credit agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 460,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Term loan facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 114,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset-specific financings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 289,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total indebtedness(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,173,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,125,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Excludes deferred financing costs of $23.8 million and $10.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollateralized Loan Obligations\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we closed two collateralized loan obligations totaling $1.9 billion, financing 51 existing first mortgage loan investments, comprising 48 pari passu participation interests and three whole loans, significantly reducing our cost of funds and increasing to 52.1% the non-recourse, matched-term financing of our loan portfolio borrowings. The collateralized loan obligations bear a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.28%, weighted average advance rate of 79.7%, and in one instance includes a reinvestment feature that provides additional liquidity that allows us to originate new loan investments funded in part or in whole by the CLO. As of December 31, 2018, the loan investments contributed to the collateralized loan obligations represented 42.3% of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of our loan investment portfolio, or $1.8 billion.\nSecured Revolving Repurchase Agreements\nAs of December 31, 2018, aggregate borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving repurchase agreements related to loans totaled $1.0 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.0% per annum, a weighted average all-in cost of credit, including associated fees and expenses, of LIBOR plus 2.6% per annum, and a weighted average advance rate of 76.6%. As of December 31, 2018, outstanding borrowings under these agreements had a weighted average term to extended maturity (assuming we have exercised all extension options and term out provisions) of 3.1 years.\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had two secured revolving repurchase agreements to finance its CMBS investing activities. Credit spreads vary depending upon the CMBS investment and advance rate. Assets pledged at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 consisted of two and three mortgage-backed securities, respectively. These agreements are 100% recourse to Holdco. The agreements include various covenants covering net worth, liquidity, recourse limitations, and debt coverage, as further discussed below.\nThe following tables detail our secured revolving

Once we identify an asset and the asset is approved by the secured revolving repurchase agreement lender to serve as collateral (which lender's approval is in its sole discretion), we and the lender may enter into a transaction whereby the lender advances to us a percentage of the value of the asset, which is referred to as the advance rate,\u201d as the purchase price for such transaction with an obligation of ours to repurchase the asset from the lender for an amount equal to the purchase price for the transaction plus a price differential, which is calculated based on an interest rate. For each transaction, we and the lender agree to a trade confirmation which sets forth, among other things, the purchase price, the maximum advance rate, the interest rate, the market value of the loan asset and any future funding obligations which are contemplated with respect to the specific transaction and/or the underlying loan asset. For loan assets which involve future funding obligations of ours, the repurchase transaction may provide for the repurchase lender to fund portions (for example, pro rata per the maximum advance rate of the related repurchase transaction) of such future funding obligations. Generally, our secured revolving repurchase agreements allow for revolving balances, which allow us to voluntarily repay balances and draw again on existing available credit. The primary obligor on each secured revolving repurchase agreement is a separate special purpose subsidiary of ours which is restricted from conducting activity other than activity related to the utilization of its secured revolving repurchase agreement. As additional credit support, our holding company subsidiary, Holdco, provides certain guarantees of the obligations of its subsidiaries. The liability of Holdco under the guarantees related to our secured revolving repurchase agreements secured by CMBS is in an amount equal to 100% of the outstanding obligations of the special purpose subsidiary which is the primary obligor under the related agreement. The liability of Holdco under the guarantees related to our secured revolving repurchase agreements secured by loans is generally capped at 25% of the outstanding obligations of the special purpose subsidiary which is the primary obligor under the related agreement. However, such liability cap under the guarantees related to our secured revolving repurchase agreements secured by loans does not apply in the event of certain bad boy\u201d defaults which can trigger recourse to Holdco for losses or the entire outstanding obligations of the borrower depending on the nature of the bad boy\u201d default in question. Examples of such bad boy\u201d defaults include, without limitation, fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful misconduct, incurrence of additional debt in violation of financing documents, and the filing of a voluntary or collusive involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of the special purpose entity subsidiary or the guarantor entity.\nEach of the secured revolving repurchase agreements have margin maintenance\u201d provisions, which are designed to allow the repurchase lender to maintain a certain margin of credit enhancement against the loan assets which serve as collateral. The lender's margin amount is typically based on a percentage of the market value of the loan asset and/or mortgaged property collateral; however, certain secured revolving repurchase agreements may also involve margin maintenance based on maintenance of a minimum debt yield with respect to the cash flow from the underlying real estate collateral. Market value determinations and redeterminations may be made by the repurchase lender in its sole discretion subject to any specified parameters regarding the repurchase lender's determination, which may involve the limitation or enumeration of factors which the repurchase lender may consider when determining market value.\nAt December 31, 2018, the weighted average haircut (which is equal to one minus the advance rate percentage against collateral for our secured revolving repurchase agreements taken as a whole) was 23.0%, as compared to 25.9% at December 31, 2017.\nGenerally, when the repurchase lender's margin amount has fallen below the outstanding purchase price for a transaction, a margin deficit exists and the repurchase lender may require that we prepay outstanding amounts on the secured revolving repurchase agreement to eliminate such margin deficit. In certain secured revolving repurchase agreement, the repurchase lender's ability to make a margin call is further limited by certain prerequisites, such as the existence of enumerated credit events\u201d or that the margin deficit exceed a specified minimum threshold.\nThe secured revolving repurchase agreements also include cash management features which generally require that income from collateral loan assets be deposited in a lender-controlled account and be disbursed in accordance with a specified waterfall of payments designed to keep facility-related obligations current before such income is disbursed for our own account. The cash management features generally require the trapping of cash in such controlled account if an uncured default remains outstanding. Furthermore, some secured revolving repurchase agreements may require an accelerated principal amortization schedule if the secured revolving repurchase agreement is in its final extended term.\nNotwithstanding that a loan asset may be subject to a financing arrangement and serve as collateral under a secured revolving repurchase agreement, we are generally granted the right to administer and service the loan and interact directly with the underlying obligors and sponsors of our loan assets so long as there is no default under the secured revolving repurchase agreement and so long as we do not engage in certain material modifications (including amendments, waivers, exercises of remedies, or releases of obligors and collateral, among other things) of the loan assets without the repurchase lender's prior consent.\nSenior Secured and Secured Credit Agreements\nOn July 12, 2018, the Company entered into a secured credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), as borrower, with Citibank, N.A. as administrative agent and lender, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as sole lead arranger and sole lead book running manager. The Credit Agreement governs a secured revolving credit agreement with aggregate secured borrowing capacity of up to $160.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability and certain other conditions, which the Company occasionally uses to finance originations or acquisitions of eligible loans on an interim basis until permanent financing is arranged. The Credit Agreement has an initial maturity date of July 12, 2020, and borrowings bear interest at an interest rate per annum equal to one-month LIBOR or the applicable base rate plus a margin of 2.25%. The initial advance rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement with respect to individual pledged assets varies and can range up to 70%, and may decline over the borrowing term of up to a 90-day period, after which borrowings against that respective asset must be repaid.\nOn September 29, 2017, the Company and Bank of America N.A. entered into a senior secured credit agreement that had a maximum commitment amount of $250 million, which could be increased from time to time, up to $500 million, at the Company's request and agreement by the lender. The Company previously exercised its accordion feature to increase the maximum commitment amount to $500 million. The current extended maturity of this agreement is September 29, 2022.\nTerm Loan Facility\nOn December 21, 2018, the Company entered into a term loan facility, as borrower, with an institutional asset manager as the lender. The term loan facility has a commitment amount of up to $750 million, bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.85%, and allows for an advance rate of no less than 70% and up to 85% based on the loans pledged to the facility. As of December 31, 2018, the Company pledged one loan investment to the facility with an outstanding borrowing of $114.3 million.\nAsset-Specific Financings\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had outstanding one and seven loan investments financed with one and three separate counterparties, respectively, as asset-specific financings. In instances where we have multiple asset-specific financings with the same lender, the financings are not cross-collateralized.\nThe following table details statistics for our asset-specific financing at December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td> Lender\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Count\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Commitment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Principal\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Undrawn\nCapacity(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Carrying\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest\nRate(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Extended\nMaturity(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BMO Harris\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collateral asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> L+5.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 04/09/22\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing provided\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> L+2.65%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 04/09/22\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collateral Asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> L+5.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing Provided\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> L+2.65%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Undrawn capacity represents the positive difference between the borrowing amount approved by the lender against collateral assets pledged by us and the amount actually drawn against those collateral assets.

The liability of Holdco under this guarantee is capped at 25% of the outstanding obligations of the special purpose subsidiary which is the primary obligor under the financing. In addition, Holdco has delivered a non-recourse carveout guarantee, which can trigger recourse to Holdco as a result of certain bad boy\u201d defaults for losses incurred by BMO Harris or the entire outstanding obligations of the financing borrower, depending on the nature of the bad boy\u201d default.\nExamples of bad boy\u201d defaults under the BMO Harris asset-specific financing include, without limitation: fraud; intentional misrepresentation; willful misconduct; incurrence of additional debt in violation of financing documents; and the filing of a voluntary or collusive involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of the special purpose entity subsidiary or the guarantor entity. The guarantee agreements for each of the asset-specific financings also contain financial covenants covering liquid assets and net worth requirements.\nNon-Consolidated Senior Interests\nIn certain instances, we create structural leverage through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third party. In either case, the senior mortgage loan (i.e., the non-consolidated senior interest) is not included on our balance sheet. When we create structural leverage through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third party, we retain on our balance sheet a mezzanine loan. As of December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding loans that we financed through the use of non-consolidated senior interests sold or co-originated in prior periods.\nFinancial Covenants for Outstanding Borrowings\nOn May 4, 2018, we amended and restated our financial covenants to align and simplify the financial covenants across the guarantees related to our secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, and asset-specific financings and to provide for additional leverage.

Accordingly, rising interest rates will generally increase our net interest income, while declining interest rates will generally decrease our net interest income. As of December 31, 2018, 100.0% of our loans by unpaid principal balance earned a floating rate of interest and were financed with liabilities that require interest payments based on floating rates, which resulted in approximately $1.2 billion of net floating rate exposure that is positively correlated to rising interest rates, subject to the impact of interest rate floors on certain of our floating rate loans. We had no fixed rate loans outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nOur liabilities are generally index-matched to each collateral asset, resulting in a net exposure to movements in benchmark rates that vary based on the relative proportion of floating rate assets and liabilities. The following table details our portfolio's net floating rate exposure as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Floating rate assets(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,313,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,195,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Floating rate debt(1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,140,968\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,125,288\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net floating rate exposure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,172,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,070,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Floating rate mortgage loan assets and liabilities are indexed to LIBOR.

See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for details.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased $18.9 million, to $139.6 million, during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest income was due primarily to loan portfolio growth of $1.1 billion and a higher average LIBOR on the underlying loans. The increase in interest income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to increased borrowings of $1.0 billion to fund loan portfolio growth and a higher average borrowing rate, due to an increase in LIBOR, during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue is comprised of net gain/loss on the sale of certain loan and CMBS investments, interest income earned on certain cash collection accounts, and miscellaneous fee income. Other revenue decreased by $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in other revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to the recognition of a loss on sale of one loan and 17 CMBS investments during the year ended December 31, 2018 in addition to recording a gain on sale related to our CMBS investments of $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in other revenue was partially offset by higher cash balances and sweep interest earned during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses are comprised of professional fees, general and administrative expenses, servicing and asset management fees, management fees payable to our Manager, and collateral management fees. Other expenses increased by $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to: (i) an increase in management fees payable to our Manager of $5.3 million due to growth in the Company's quarterly common stockholder's equity base and Core Earnings and (ii) an increase of general and administrative expenses and professional fees of $1.1 million as a result of our continued growth in size and the complexities of being a public company. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in servicing and asset management fees and collateral management fees of $0.6 million primarily as a result of amending our servicing and asset management agreement during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSee Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for details regarding our Management Agreement and the revisions made in connection with the initial public offering.\nIncentive Compensation\nThe incentive compensation earned by our Manager increased by $0.05 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The incentive compensation to our Manager increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily as a result of the Management Agreement revisions in connection with the completion of our IPO, growth in the Company's quarterly common stockholder's equity base due to our common stock issuance in August 2018 and completion of our IPO during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSee Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for details regarding our Management Agreement and the revisions made in connection with the IPO.\nDividends Declared Per Share\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we declared common and class A common stock dividends of $1.71 per share, or $109.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we declared common and class A common stock dividends of $1.56 per share, or $85.0 million. The increase of dividends declared was primarily due to loan portfolio growth and increased net interest income during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nUnrealized (Loss) Gain on CMBS\nOther comprehensive (loss) increased $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is primarily related to fair value fluctuations of certain CMBS investments and changes in the size and composition of our CMBS investment portfolio from the year ended December 31, 2017.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased $28.7 million, to $120.6 million, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in interest income was due primarily to loan portfolio growth of $727.0 million and a higher average LIBOR on the underlying loans. The increase in interest income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to increased borrowings of $992.5 million to fund loan portfolio growth and a higher average borrowing rate, due to an increase in LIBOR, during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue is comprised of net gain/loss on the sale of certain loans and CMBS investments, interest income earned on certain cash collection accounts, and miscellaneous fee income. Other revenue increased by $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in other revenue was partially due to higher cash balances during the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, we recognized a gain on sale related to our CMBS investments of $0.3 million and a $0.1 million increase in miscellaneous fee income as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses are comprised of professional fees, general and administrative expenses, servicing and asset management fees, management fees payable to our Manager, and collateral management fees. Due primarily to increased operating costs as a public company and increased fees payable to our Manager as a result of our initial public offering and the calculation of such fees in our new Management Agreement, we expect these expenses to continue to increase following the completion of our initial public offering. Our general and administrative expenses are higher as a public company than when private due to investor relations and SEC reporting costs, increased accounting fees, NYSE costs, regulatory compliance, and other items required of a public company.\nOther expenses increased by $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to: (i) an increase in management fees payable to our Manager of $5.3 million due to growth in the Company's quarterly common stockholder's equity base of $211.6 million due to our IPO and growth in Core Earnings and (ii) a net increase of general and administrative expenses and professional fees of $0.6 million as a result of our continued growth in size and the complexities of being a public company. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in servicing and asset management fees and collateral management fees of $1.2 million primarily as a result of terminating our CLO during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSee Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for details regarding our Management Agreement and the revisions made in connection with the initial public offering.\nIncentive Compensation\nThe incentive compensation earned by our Manager increased by $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in incentive compensation to our Manager was primarily a result of the Management Agreement revisions in connection with the completion of our IPO, growth in the Company's quarterly common stockholder's equity base of $211.6 million due to our IPO and growth in Core Earnings during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSee Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for details regarding our Management Agreement and the revisions made in connection with the IPO.\nDividends Declared Per Share\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we declared dividends of $1.56 per share, or $85.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we declared dividends of $1.62 per share, or $66.9 million. The per share decrease was primarily due to an increase of shares outstanding of our common stock and Class A common stock of 21.1 million shares resulting from our IPO and stock dividend completed during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nUnrealized (Loss) Gain on CMBS\nOther comprehensive (loss) income decreased $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily related to the sale of a CMBS investment in the year ended December 31, 2017 and fair value fluctuations related to our remaining CMBS investments from 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapitalization\nWe have capitalized our business to date through, among other things, the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, borrowings under secured revolving repurchase agreements, collateralized loan obligations, senior secured and secured credit agreements, a term loan facility, and asset-specific financings. Additionally, during prior years we have utilized the sale of non-consolidated senior interests, a private collateralized loan obligation, and a subscription secured credit facility to finance our operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding 67.2 million shares of our common stock and Class A common stock representing $1.3 billion of stockholders' equity, and $3.2 billion of outstanding borrowings used to finance our operations.\nSee Notes 5 and 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for additional details regarding our borrowings under secured revolving repurchase agreements, collateralized loan obligations, senior secured and secured credit agreements, a term loan facility, and asset-specific financings.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, available borrowings under secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, a term loan facility, and

accounts receivable from our servicers until released, and the proceeds from such repayments become available for us to reinvest.\nLiquidity Needs\nIn addition to our ongoing loan activity, our primary liquidity needs include interest and principal payments under our $3.2 billion of outstanding borrowings under secured revolving repurchase agreements, collateralized loan obligations, senior secured and secured credit agreements, a term loan facility, and asset-specific financings, $634.2 million of unfunded loan commitments, dividend distributions to our stockholders, and operating

This is only an estimate, as actual amounts borrowed and rates will vary over time. Our floating rate loans and related liabilities are indexed to LIBOR.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWith respect to our debt obligations that are contractually due within the next five years, we plan to employ several strategies to meet these obligations, including: (i) applying repayments from underlying loans to satisfy the debt obligations which they secure; (ii) exercising maturity date extension options that exist in our current financing arrangements; (iii) negotiating extensions of terms with our providers of credit; (iv) periodically accessing the capital markets to raise cash to fund new investments or the repayment of indebtedness; (v) the issuance of additional structured finance vehicles, such as a collateralized loan obligations similar to TRTX 2018-FL1 or TRTX 2018-FL2, as a method of financing; (vi) term loans with private lenders; and/or (vii) selling loan or CMBS investments to generate cash to repay our debt obligations.\nWe are required to pay our Manager a base management fee, an incentive fee, and reimbursements for certain expenses pursuant to our Management Agreement. The table above does not include the amounts payable to our Manager under our Management Agreement as they are not fixed and determinable. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional terms and details of the fees payable under our Management Agreement.\nAs a REIT, we generally must distribute substantially all of our net taxable income to stockholders in the form of dividends to comply with the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Our REIT taxable income does not necessarily equal our net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP or our Core Earnings as described above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the net change in our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (dollars in thousands):\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 107,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 91,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,192,865\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (702,582\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (544,891\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,050,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 583,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 457,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (35,017\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28,238\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,976\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe experienced a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a net decrease of $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $107.7 million related primarily to net interest income. During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash flows used in investing activities totaled $1.2 billion due primarily to loan originations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $1.1 billion due primarily to proceeds from our collateralized loan obligations (TRTX 2018-FL1 and TRTX 2018-FL2) and common stock issuances and net secured financing proceeds. We used the proceeds from our investing and financing activities, including cash provided by loan principal repayments and debt investments, to originate new loans and acquire CMBS investments of $2.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe experienced a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net decrease of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $91.2 million related primarily to net interest income. During the year ended December 31, 2017, cash flows used in investing activities totaled $702.6 million due primarily to loan originations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $583.2 million due primarily to proceeds from secured financing agreements, the completion of our initial public offering, and the sale of $53.0 million of non-consolidated senior interests. We used the proceeds from our investing and financing activities, including cash provided by principal repayments and debt investments, to originate new loans and acquire CMBS investments of $2.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCorporate Activities\nIncome Taxes\nWe made an election to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our initial taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws.\nOur qualification as a REIT also depends on our ability to meet various other requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, which relate to organizational structure, diversity of stock ownership, and certain restrictions with regard to the nature of our assets and the sources of our income. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal income and excise taxes and state and local taxes on our income and assets. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT for any taxable year, we may be subject to material penalties as well as U.S. federal, state and local income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and we would not be able to qualify as a REIT for the subsequent four full taxable years. We believe we have complied with all REIT requirements since our initial taxable year.\nCommon Stock Issuance\nOn August 10, 2018, the Company completed a common stock offering of 7 million shares at a price of $19.82 per share for gross proceeds of $138.7 million. The Company used the proceeds from the offering to repay certain borrowings under its secured revolving repurchase agreements, and to originate or acquire commercial mortgage loans consistent with its investment strategy and investment guidelines.\nDividends\nOn December 18, 2018, we declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of 2018, to holders of record of our common stock and Class A common stock as of December 28, 2018, in the amount of $0.43 per share of common stock and Class A common stock, or $29.0 million in the aggregate, which dividend was paid on January 25, 2019.\n10b5-1 Plan\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 23,577 shares of common stock, at a weighted average price of $18.18 per share, for total consideration (including commissions and related fees) of $0.4 million.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn July 25, 2017, we completed our initial public offering in which we sold 11,000,000 shares of our common stock at an initial public offering price of $20.00 per share. The shares offered and sold in the initial public offering were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-217446), which was declared effective by the SEC on July 19, 2017. The aggregate offering price for the shares registered and sold by us was approximately $220 million. The underwriters of the offering were Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., TPG Capital BD, LLC and JMP Securities LLC.\nThe initial public offering generated $199.4 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts of $13.2 million and offering expenses payable by us of approximately $7.4 million. On August 17, 2017, the underwriters of the Company's initial public offering partially exercised their option to purchase up to an additional 1,650,000 shares of common stock. On August 22, 2017, the Company issued and sold, and the underwriters purchased, 650,000 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $12.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts of $0.8 million. TPG Capital BD, LLC, an underwriter in the offering, is an affiliate and received underwriting discounts of approximately $0.6 million. No other offering expenses were paid directly or indirectly to any of our directors or officers (or their associates), persons owning 10 percent or more of our common stock or any other affiliates.\nWe used the net proceeds from the offering to originate commercial mortgage loans consistent with our investment strategy and investment guidelines.\nArticles of Amendment and Restatement\nOn July 19, 2017, we filed Articles of Amendment and Restatement with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland. The Articles of Amendment and Restatement increased our authorized common stock to 300,000,000 shares of common stock and 2,500,000 shares of Class A common stock with $0.001 par value per share. Additionally, the Articles of Amendment and Restatement increased our authorized preferred stock to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a $0.001 par value per share.\nStock Dividend\nOn July 3, 2017, we declared a stock dividend that resulted in the issuance of 9,224,268 shares of our common stock and 230,815 shares of our Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial public offering. The stock dividend was paid on July 25, 2017 to holders of record of our common stock and Class A common stock as of July 3, 2017.\nTermination of Pre-IPO Capital Commitments\nIn connection with the completion of our initial public offering, all of the obligations of certain of our pre-IPO stockholders to purchase additional shares of our common stock and Class A common stock using the undrawn portion of their capital commitments was terminated.\nTermination of Stockholders Agreement\nUpon the completion of our initial public offering, the stockholders agreement between us and certain of our pre-IPO stockholders terminated in accordance with its terms.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. During 2018, our Manager reviewed and evaluated our critical accounting policies and believes them to be appropriate. The following is a summary of our significant accounting policies that we believe are the most affected by our Manager's judgments, estimates, and assumptions:\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest income on loans is accrued using the interest method based on the contractual terms of the loan, adjusted for credit impairment, if any. The objective of the interest method is to arrive at periodic interest income including recognition of fees and costs at a constant effective yield. Premiums, discounts, and origination fees are amortized or accreted into interest income over the lives of the loans using the interest method, or on a straight line basis when it approximates the interest method. Extension and modification fees are accreted into income on a straight line basis, when it approximates the interest method, over the related extension or modification period. Exit fees are accreted into income on a straight line basis, when it approximates the interest method, over the lives of the loans to which they relate unless they can be waived by the Company or a co-lender in connection with a loan refinancing. Prepayment penalties from borrowers are recognized as interest income when received. Certain of the Company's loan investments have in the past and may in the future provide for additional interest based on the borrower's operating cash flow or appreciation of the underlying collateral. Such amounts are considered contingent interest and are reflected as interest income only upon certainty of collection.\nThe Company considers a loan to be non-performing and places the loan on non-accrual status when: (1) management determines the borrower is incapable of, or has ceased efforts toward, curing the cause of a default; (2) the loan becomes 90 days delinquent; or (3) the loan experiences a maturity default. Based on the Company's judgment as to the collectability of principal, a loan on non-accrual status is either accounted for on a cash basis, where interest income is recognized only upon receipt of cash for principal and interest payments, or on a cost-\nrecovery basis, where all cash receipts reduce the loan's carrying value, and interest income is only recorded when such carrying value has been fully recovered.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, no loans were placed on non-accrual status and no losses or impairments were recorded to our loan portfolio.\nLoans Held for Investment\nLoans that the Company has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or repayment, are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any premiums, discounts, loan origination fees and loan loss allowances, if any. Loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are deferred and recognized in interest income over the estimated life of the loans using the interest method, or on a straight line basis when it approximates the interest method, adjusted for actual prepayments.\nThe Company evaluates each loan classified as a loan held for investment for impairment on a quarterly basis. Impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If the loan is considered to be impaired, a loan loss allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the loan to the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate, or the fair value of the collateral securing the impaired loan, less estimated costs to sell such collateral, if recovery of the Company's investment is expected solely from the sale of such collateral. As part of the quarterly impairment review, the Company evaluates the risk of each loan and assigns a risk rating based on a variety of factors, grouped as follows to include, among other factors: (i) loan and credit structure, including the as-is loan-to-value ( LTV\u201d) and structural features; (ii) quality and stability of real estate value and operating cash flow, including debt yield, property type, dynamics of the geographic, property-type and local market, physical condition, stability of cash flow, leasing velocity and quality and diversity of tenancy; (iii) performance against underwritten business plan; and (iv) quality, experience and financial condition of sponsor, borrower and guarantor(s). Based on a 5-point scale, the Company's loans are rated 1\u201d through 5,\u201d from least risk to greatest risk, respectively, which ratings are defined as follows:\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Outperform-Exceeds performance metrics (for example, technical milestones, occupancy, rents, net operating income) included in original or current credit underwriting and business plan;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 256: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Meets or Exceeds Expectations-Collateral performance meets or exceeds substantially all performance metrics included in original or current underwriting / business plan;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 257: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Satisfactory-Collateral performance meets or is on track to meet underwriting; business plan is met or can reasonably be achieved;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 258: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Underperformance-Collateral performance falls short of original underwriting, material differences exist from business plan, or both; technical milestones have been missed; defaults may exist, or may soon occur absent material improvement; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 259: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Risk of Impairment/Default-Collateral performance is significantly worse than underwriting; major variance from business plan; loan covenants or technical milestones have been breached; timely exit from loan via sale or refinancing is questionable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSince Inception, the Company has not recognized any impairments on its loan portfolio and has not recorded any loan loss allowances against any of the loans in its portfolio. The Company's determination of asset-specific loan loss reserves, should any such reserves be necessary, relies on material estimates regarding the fair value of loan collateral. Such losses could be caused by various factors, including, but not limited to, unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or events adversely affecting specific assets, borrowers, industries in which our borrowers operate or markets in which our borrowers or their properties are located. Significant judgment is required when evaluating loans for impairment.\nThe Company's loans are typically collateralized by real estate, or in the case of mezzanine loans, by a partnership or similar equity interest in an entity that owns real estate. As a result, the Company regularly evaluates on a loan-by-loan basis the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower/sponsor. The Company also evaluates the financial strength of loan guarantors, if any, and the borrower's competency in managing and operating the property or properties. In addition, the Company considers the overall economic environment, real estate sector, and geographic sub-market in which the borrower operates. Such impairment\nanalyses are completed and reviewed by asset management personnel and evaluated by senior management, who utilize various data sources, including (i) periodic financial data such as property occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, the borrower's exit plan, and capitalization and discount rates, (ii) site inspections, (iii) sales and financing comparables, (iv) current credit spreads for refinancing and (v) other market data.\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a listing and description of our significant accounting policies.\nLoan

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those in this discussion as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Part, 1. Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nIntroduction\nWe are a commercial real estate finance company externally managed by TPG RE Finance Trust Management, L.P. and sponsored by TPG. We directly originate, acquire and manage commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate-related debt instruments in North America for our balance sheet. We operate our business as one segment.\nWe have made an election to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our initial taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We believe we have been organized and have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and we believe that our organization and current and intended manner of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. We operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain an exclusion or exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act.\n2018 Highlights\nOperating Results:\n \u2022 Generated GAAP net income of $106.9 million, an increase of $12.6 million, or 13.3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 Increased Core Earnings to $107.4 million, or $1.70 per share, an increase of $13.0 million, or 13.8%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 Declared dividends of $109.1 million, or $1.71 per share, representing a dividend yield of 8.7% on a Book Value per Common Share of $19.76 as of December 31, 2018. \nInvestment Portfolio Activity:\n \u2022 Originated 26 loans with a total commitment of $2.52 billion, an initial unpaid principal balance of $2.09 billion, unfunded commitments upon closing of $436.2 million, and a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.6%. \n \u2022 Funded $258.3 million in connection with existing loans having future funding obligations. \n \u2022 Received cash proceeds of $1.2 billion from principal repayments, including $2.6 million from loan sales. \nPortfolio Financing Activity:\n \u2022 Closed two collateralized loan obligations totaling $1.9 billion, financing 51 existing first mortgage loan investments, comprising 48 pari passu participation interests and three whole loans, significantly reducing cost of funds and increasing non-recourse, matched-term financing of the loan portfolio. \n \u2022 Closed a non-recourse term loan facility of up to $750 million and established a $160 million secured credit agreement to table fund new loan investments. \n \u2022 Raised gross proceeds of $138.7 million through an underwritten common stock offering of 7 million shares at a price of $19.82 per share. \nAvailable Liquidity:\n \u2022 At December 31, 2018, we had unrestricted cash available for investment of $39.7 million, a portion of which is subject to certain liquidity covenants, and CMBS investments with an aggregate face amount of $76.4 million available for sale. \n \u2022 At December 31, 2018, we had undrawn capacity (liquidity available to us without the need to pledge more collateral to our lenders) of $236.5 million under secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, and a term loan facility, with eight lenders: \n \u2022 $236.5 million of undrawn capacity in connection with our secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, and a term loan facility, with an aggregate maximum commitment amount of $4.0 billion and a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.0% as of December 31, 2018, providing stable financing, with mark-to-market provisions limited to asset and, in one instance, market specific events and a weighted average term to extended maturity (assuming we have exercised all extension options and term out provisions) of 3.4 years. \n \u2022 As of December 31, 2018, we had $2.6 billion of financing capacity under secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, and a term loan facility, provided by nine lenders. Our ability to draw on this capacity is dependent upon our lenders' willingness to accept as collateral loan or CMBS investments we pledge to them to secure additional borrowings: \n \u2022 $2.4 billion of financing capacity is available for loan investments under our secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, and a term loan facility for loan originations and acquisitions, with an aggregate maximum commitment amount of $4.0 billion and credit spreads based upon the LTV and other risk characteristics of collateral pledged, which together provide stable financing with mark-to-market provisions generally limited to asset and, in one instance, market specific events, and a weighted average term to extended maturity (assuming we have exercised all extension options and term out provisions) of 3.4 years. These financing arrangements are 25% and 100% recourse to Holdco. \n \u2022 $167.3 million of financing capacity is available for CMBS investments under two secured revolving repurchase agreements, with a maximum commitment amount of $200 million, credit spreads based upon the haircut and other risk characteristics of the collateral pledged, and a weighted average term to extended maturity (assuming we have exercised all extension options and term out provisions and have obtained the consent of our lenders) of 0.01 years (or approximately one month). These agreements are 100% recourse to Holdco. \nKey Financial Measures and Indicators\nAs a commercial real estate finance company, we believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are earnings per share, dividends declared per share, Core Earnings, and book value per share. For the three months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded earnings per share of $0.43, declared a dividend of $0.43 per share, and reported $0.43 per share of Core Earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded earnings per share of $1.70, declared dividends of $1.71 per share, and reported $1.70 per share of Core Earnings. In addition, our book value per common share as of December 31, 2018 was $19.76. As further described below, Core Earnings is a measure that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use Core Earnings to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan activity and operations.\nEarnings Per Common Share and Dividends Declared Per Common Share\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share and dividends declared per share (in thousands, except share and per share data):\n\n (1) Weighted average number of shares outstanding includes common stock and Class A common stock. \n (2) Share and per share data reflect the impact of the common stock and Class A common stock dividend which was paid upon completion of the Company's initial public offering on July 25, 2017 to holders of record as of July 3, 2017. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for details. \nCore Earnings\nWe use Core Earnings to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan activity and operations. Core Earnings is a non-GAAP measure, which we define as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to our stockholders, including realized gains and losses not otherwise included in GAAP net income (loss), and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) unrealized gains (losses), and (iv) certain non-cash items. Core Earnings may also be adjusted from time to time to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash charges as determined by our Manager, subject to approval by a majority of our independent directors. The exclusion of depreciation and amortization from the calculation of Core Earnings only applies to debt investments related to real estate to the extent we foreclose upon the property or properties underlying such debt investments.\nWe believe that Core Earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to our net income and cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Although pursuant to the Management Agreement we calculate the incentive and base management fees due to our Manager using Core Earnings before incentive fee expense, we report Core Earnings after incentive fee expense, because we believe this is a more meaningful presentation of the economic performance of our common and Class A common stock.\nCore Earnings does not represent net income or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, or an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operations, a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. In addition, our methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and accordingly, our reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to the Core Earnings reported by other companies.\nFor additional information on the fees we pay our Manager, see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders to Core Earnings (in thousands, except share and per share data):\n\n (1) Represents GAAP net income attributable to our common and Class A common stockholders. \n (2) Share and per share data reflect the impact of the common stock and Class A common stock dividend which was paid upon completion of the Company's initial public offering on July 25, 2017 to holders of record as of July 3, 2017. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for details. \nBook Value Per Common Share\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of our book value per share (in thousands, except share and per share data):\n\n (1) Includes shares of common and Class A common stock. \n (2) Share and per share data reflect the impact of the common stock and Class A common stock dividend which was paid upon completion of the Company's initial public offering on July 25, 2017 to holders of record as of July 3, 2017. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for details. \nInvestment Portfolio Overview\nLoan Portfolio\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2018, we originated five loans with a total loan commitment amount of $623.70 million, of which $452.08 million was funded at origination. Other loan fundings included $50.65 million of deferred fundings related to previously originated loan commitments. Proceeds from loan repayments during the three months ended December 31, 2018 totaled $367.9 million. We generated interest income of $71.7 million, incurred interest expense of $35.6 million, and generated net interest income of $36.1 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we originated 26 loans with a total loan commitment amount of $2.52 billion, of which $2.09 billion was funded at origination. Other loan fundings included $258.3 million of deferred fundings related to previously originated loan commitments. Proceeds from loan repayments and sales during the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.2 billion and $2.6 million, respectively, totaling $1.2 billion. We generated interest income of $265.6 million, incurred interest expense of $126.0 million, and generated net interest income of $139.6 million.\nThe following table details our loan activity by unpaid principal balance (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Additional fundings made under existing loan commitments. \nThe following table details overall statistics for our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Unfunded loan commitments may be funded over the term of each loan, subject in certain cases to an expiration date or a force-funding date, primarily to finance property improvements or lease-related expenditures by our borrowers, to finance operating deficits during renovation and lease-up, and in some instances to finance development. \n (2) As of December 31, 2018, our floating rate loans were indexed to LIBOR. In addition to credit spread, all-in yield includes the amortization of deferred origination fees, purchase price premium and discount, loan origination costs and accrual of both extension and exit fees. Credit spread and all-in yield for the total portfolio assumes the applicable floating benchmark rate as of December 31, 2018 for weighted average calculations. \n (3) Extended maturity assumes all extension options are exercised by the borrower; provided, however, that our loans may be repaid prior to such date. As of December 31, 2018, based on the unpaid principal balance of our total loan exposure, 76.8% of our loans were subject to yield maintenance or other prepayment restrictions and 23.2% were open to repayment by the borrower without penalty. \n (4) LTV is calculated as the total outstanding principal balance of the loan or participation interest in a loan plus any financing that is pari passu with or senior to such loan or participation interest as of December 31, 2018, divided by the applicable as-is real estate value at the time of origination or acquisition of such loan or participation interest in a loan. The as-is real estate value reflects our Manager's estimates, at the time of origination or acquisition of a loan or participation interest in a loan, of the real estate value underlying such loan or participation interest, determined in accordance with our Manager's underwriting standards and consistent with third-party appraisals obtained by our Manager. \nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for details about our mortgage loan originations subsequent to December 31, 2018.\nCMBS Portfolio\nWe invest from time to time in CMBS and CMBS-related assets as part of our investment strategy, often as a short-term cash management tool. As of December 31, 2018, our CMBS portfolio consisted of four fixed rate securities, the underlying collateral of which consists of first mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate properties. The underlying real estate collateral is located across the United States, primarily in California and Texas, with no state representing more than 24.3% of an investment's current face amount. Additionally, the payment of principal and interest on the securities in our CMBS portfolio at December 31, 2018 is guaranteed by a U.S. Government agency or a U.S. government sponsored enterprise ( GSE\u201d). At December 31, 2018, there were no floating rate securities in our CMBS Portfolio.\nThe following table details overall statistics for our CMBS portfolio as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Amounts disclosed are before giving effect to unamortized purchase price premium and discount and unrealized gains or losses. \n (2) Weighted by market value as of December 31, 2018. \n (3) The largest structured finance investment is 100% collateralized by multifamily mortgage loans underwritten by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( FHLMC\u201d), which loans are slated for near term securitization by FHLMC. Upon the contractual maturity of the structured finance investment, FHLMC is required to purchase all of the performing mortgage loans at par. Currently, all of the underlying mortgage loans are performing. The other CMBS investments are structured finance investments issued by Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae which are backed primarily by mortgage loans on multifamily properties that satisfy GSE program requirements. These bonds are unrated but carry a government guaranty. \nAsset Management\nWe proactively manage the assets in our portfolio from closing to final repayment. We are party to an agreement with Situs Asset Management, LLC ( Situs\u201d), one of the largest commercial mortgage loan servicers, pursuant to which Situs provides us with dedicated asset management employees for performing asset management services pursuant to our proprietary guidelines. Following the closing of an investment, this dedicated asset management team rigorously monitors the investment under our Manager's oversight, with an emphasis on ongoing financial, legal and quantitative analyses. Through the final repayment of an investment, the asset management team maintains regular contact with borrowers, servicers and local market experts monitoring performance of the collateral, anticipating borrower, property and market issues, and enforcing our rights and remedies when appropriate.\nOur Manager reviews our entire loan portfolio quarterly, undertakes an assessment of the performance of each loan, and assigns it a risk rating between 1\u201d and 5,\u201d from least risk to greatest risk, respectively. See Notes 2 and 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for a discussion regarding the risk rating system that we use in connection with our portfolio. The following table allocates the carrying value of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 based on our internal risk ratings (dollars in thousands):\n\nThe weighted average risk rating of our total loan exposure based on unpaid principal balance was 2.8 and 2.6 as of December 31, 2018 and December 31 2017, respectively.\nInvestment Portfolio Financing\nOur portfolio financing arrangements during the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 included collateralized loan obligations, secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, a term loan facility, and asset-specific financing arrangements. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we also had outstanding non-consolidated senior interests of $96.4 million.\nThe following table details our portfolio financing outstanding principal balances (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Excludes deferred financing costs of $23.8 million and $10.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. \nCollateralized Loan Obligations\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we closed two collateralized loan obligations totaling $1.9 billion, financing 51 existing first mortgage loan investments, comprising 48 pari passu participation interests and three whole loans, significantly reducing our cost of funds and increasing to 52.1% the non-recourse, matched-term financing of our loan portfolio borrowings. The collateralized loan obligations bear a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.28%, weighted average advance rate of 79.7%, and in one instance includes a reinvestment feature that provides additional liquidity that allows us to originate new loan investments funded in part or in whole by the CLO. As of December 31, 2018, the loan investments contributed to the collateralized loan obligations represented 42.3% of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of our loan investment portfolio, or $1.8 billion.\nSecured Revolving Repurchase Agreements\nAs of December 31, 2018, aggregate borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving repurchase agreements related to loans totaled $1.0 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.0% per annum, a weighted average all-in cost of credit, including associated fees and expenses, of LIBOR plus 2.6% per annum, and a weighted average advance rate of 76.6%. As of December 31, 2018, outstanding borrowings under these agreements had a weighted average term to extended maturity (assuming we have exercised all extension options and term out provisions) of 3.1 years.\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had two secured revolving repurchase agreements to finance its CMBS investing activities. Credit spreads vary depending upon the CMBS investment and advance rate. Assets pledged at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 consisted of two and three mortgage-backed securities, respectively. These agreements are 100% recourse to Holdco. The agreements include various covenants covering net worth, liquidity, recourse limitations, and debt coverage, as further discussed below.\nThe following tables detail our secured revolving repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Commitment amount represents the largest amount of borrowings available under a given agreement once sufficient collateral assets have been approved by the lender and pledged by us. \n (2) Represents the commitment amount less the approved borrowings which amount is available to be borrowed provided we pledge and the lender approves additional collateral assets. \n (3) Undrawn capacity represents the positive difference between the borrowing amount approved by the lender against collateral assets pledged by us and the amount actually drawn against those collateral assets. \n (4) Our ability to extend our secured revolving repurchase agreements to the dates shown above is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. Even if extended, our lenders retain sole discretion to determine whether to accept pledged collateral, and the advance rate and credit spread applicable to each borrowing thereunder. \n (5) Extended Maturity represents the sooner of the next maturity date of the agreement, or roll over date for the applicable underlying trade confirmation, subsequent to December 31, 2018. Weighted average interest rate includes the impact of the Overnight swap index ( OIS\u201d) rate used for CMBS secured revolving repurchase agreements. \nThe following table details our secured revolving repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Commitment amount represents the largest amount of borrowings available under a given agreement once sufficient collateral assets have been approved by the lender and pledged by us. \n (2) Represents the commitment amount less the approved borrowings which amount is available to be borrowed provided we pledge and the lender approves additional collateral assets. \n (3) Undrawn capacity represents the positive difference between the borrowing amount approved by the lender against collateral assets pledged by us and the amount actually drawn against those collateral assets. \n (4) Our ability to extend our secured revolving repurchase agreements to the dates shown above is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. Even if extended, our lenders retain sole discretion to determine whether to accept pledged collateral, and the advance rate and credit spread applicable to each borrowing thereunder. \n (5) Extended Maturity represents the sooner of the next maturity date of the agreement, or roll over date for the applicable underlying trade confirmation, subsequent to December 31, 2017. \nBorrowings under our secured revolving repurchase agreements are subject to the initial approval of eligible collateral loans (or CMBS, depending on the agreement) by the lender. The maximum advance rate and pricing rate of individual advances are determined with reference to the attributes of the respective collateral.\nThe maximum and average month end balances for our secured revolving repurchase agreements during the year ended December 31, 2018 are as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) The maximum month end balance subtotal and total represents the maximum outstanding borrowings on all secured revolving repurchase agreement at a month end during the year ended December 31, 2018. \nWe use secured revolving repurchase agreements to finance certain of our originations or acquisitions of our target assets, which may be accepted by a respective secured revolving repurchase agreement lender as collateral. Once we identify an asset and the asset is approved by the secured revolving repurchase agreement lender to serve as collateral (which lender's approval is in its sole discretion), we and the lender may enter into a transaction whereby the lender advances to us a percentage of the value of the asset, which is referred to as the advance rate,\u201d as the purchase price for such transaction with an obligation of ours to repurchase the asset from the lender for an amount equal to the purchase price for the transaction plus a price differential, which is calculated based on an interest rate. For each transaction, we and the lender agree to a trade confirmation which sets forth, among other things, the purchase price, the maximum advance rate, the interest rate, the market value of the loan asset and any future funding obligations which are contemplated with respect to the specific transaction and/or the underlying loan asset. For loan assets which involve future funding obligations of ours, the repurchase transaction may provide for the repurchase lender to fund portions (for example, pro rata per the maximum advance rate of the related repurchase transaction) of such future funding obligations. Generally, our secured revolving repurchase agreements allow for revolving balances, which allow us to voluntarily repay balances and draw again on existing available credit. The primary obligor on each secured revolving repurchase agreement is a separate special purpose subsidiary of ours which is restricted from conducting activity other than activity related to the utilization of its secured revolving repurchase agreement. As additional credit support, our holding company subsidiary, Holdco, provides certain guarantees of the obligations of its subsidiaries. The liability of Holdco under the guarantees related to our secured revolving repurchase agreements secured by CMBS is in an amount equal to 100% of the outstanding obligations of the special purpose subsidiary which is the primary obligor under the related agreement. The liability of Holdco under the guarantees related to our secured revolving repurchase agreements secured by loans is generally capped at 25% of the outstanding obligations of the special purpose subsidiary which is the primary obligor under the related agreement. However, such liability cap under the guarantees related to our secured revolving repurchase agreements secured by loans does not apply in the event of certain bad boy\u201d defaults which can trigger recourse to Holdco for losses or the entire outstanding obligations of the borrower depending on the nature of the bad boy\u201d default in question. Examples of such bad boy\u201d defaults include, without limitation, fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful misconduct, incurrence of additional debt in violation of financing documents, and the filing of a voluntary or collusive involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of the special purpose entity subsidiary or the guarantor entity.\nEach of the secured revolving repurchase agreements have margin maintenance\u201d provisions, which are designed to allow the repurchase lender to maintain a certain margin of credit enhancement against the loan assets which serve as collateral. The lender's margin amount is typically based on a percentage of the market value of the loan asset and/or mortgaged property collateral; however, certain secured revolving repurchase agreements may also involve margin maintenance based on maintenance of a minimum debt yield with respect to the cash flow from the underlying real estate collateral. Market value determinations and redeterminations may be made by the repurchase lender in its sole discretion subject to any specified parameters regarding the repurchase lender's determination, which may involve the limitation or enumeration of factors which the repurchase lender may consider when determining market value.\nAt December 31, 2018, the weighted average haircut (which is equal to one minus the advance rate percentage against collateral for our secured revolving repurchase agreements taken as a whole) was 23.0%, as compared to 25.9% at December 31, 2017.\nGenerally, when the repurchase lender's margin amount has fallen below the outstanding purchase price for a transaction, a margin deficit exists and the repurchase lender may require that we prepay outstanding amounts on the secured revolving repurchase agreement to eliminate such margin deficit. In certain secured revolving repurchase agreement, the repurchase lender's ability to make a margin call is further limited by certain prerequisites, such as the existence of enumerated credit events\u201d or that the margin deficit exceed a specified minimum threshold.\nThe secured revolving repurchase agreements also include cash management features which generally require that income from collateral loan assets be deposited in a lender-controlled account and be disbursed in accordance with a specified waterfall of payments designed to keep facility-related obligations current before such income is disbursed for our own account. The cash management features generally require the trapping of cash in such controlled account if an uncured default remains outstanding. Furthermore, some secured revolving repurchase agreements may require an accelerated principal amortization schedule if the secured revolving repurchase agreement is in its final extended term.\nNotwithstanding that a loan asset may be subject to a financing arrangement and serve as collateral under a secured revolving repurchase agreement, we are generally granted the right to administer and service the loan and interact directly with the underlying obligors and sponsors of our loan assets so long as there is no default under the secured revolving repurchase agreement and so long as we do not engage in certain material modifications (including amendments, waivers, exercises of remedies, or releases of obligors and collateral, among other things) of the loan assets without the repurchase lender's prior consent.\nSenior Secured and Secured Credit Agreements\nOn July 12, 2018, the Company entered into a secured credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), as borrower, with Citibank, N.A. as administrative agent and lender, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as sole lead arranger and sole lead book running manager. The Credit Agreement governs a secured revolving credit agreement with aggregate secured borrowing capacity of up to $160.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability and certain other conditions, which the Company occasionally uses to finance originations or acquisitions of eligible loans on an interim basis until permanent financing is arranged. The Credit Agreement has an initial maturity date of July 12, 2020, and borrowings bear interest at an interest rate per annum equal to one-month LIBOR or the applicable base rate plus a margin of 2.25%. The initial advance rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement with respect to individual pledged assets varies and can range up to 70%, and may decline over the borrowing term of up to a 90-day period, after which borrowings against that respective asset must be repaid.\nOn September 29, 2017, the Company and Bank of America N.A. entered into a senior secured credit agreement that had a maximum commitment amount of $250 million, which could be increased from time to time, up to $500 million, at the Company's request and agreement by the lender. The Company previously exercised its accordion feature to increase the maximum commitment amount to $500 million. The current extended maturity of this agreement is September 29, 2022.\nTerm Loan Facility\nOn December 21, 2018, the Company entered into a term loan facility, as borrower, with an institutional asset manager as the lender. The term loan facility has a commitment amount of up to $750 million, bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.85%, and allows for an advance rate of no less than 70% and up to 85% based on the loans pledged to the facility. As of December 31, 2018, the Company pledged one loan investment to the facility with an outstanding borrowing of $114.3 million.\nAsset-Specific Financings\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had outstanding one and seven loan investments financed with one and three separate counterparties, respectively, as asset-specific financings. In instances where we have multiple asset-specific financings with the same lender, the financings are not cross-collateralized.\nThe following table details statistics for our asset-specific financing at December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Undrawn capacity represents the positive difference between the borrowing amount approved by the lender against collateral assets pledged by us and the amount actually drawn against those collateral assets. In the case of asset-specific financings, our ability to draw the undrawn capacity is conditioned upon satisfaction by our borrower of conditions precedent to a funding on the underlying loan pledged as collateral, and by our pro rata funding with equity of the remaining future funding obligation. Amounts designated as undrawn capacity under our asset specific financings may only be used to satisfy our future funding obligations on the respective underlying pledged loan. \n (2) All of these floating rate loans and related liabilities are indexed to LIBOR. \n (3) For each of the Collateral Assets, extended maturity is determined based on the maximum maturity of each of the corresponding loans, assuming all extension options are exercised by the borrower; provided, however, that our loans may be repaid prior to such date. \nThe following table details our asset-specific financings at December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Undrawn capacity represents the positive difference between the borrowing amount approved by the lender against collateral assets pledged by us and the amount actually drawn against those collateral assets. In the case of asset-specific financings, our ability to draw the undrawn capacity is conditioned upon satisfaction by our borrower of conditions precedent to a funding on the underlying loan pledged as collateral, and by our pro rata funding with equity of the remaining future funding obligation.

The liability of Holdco under this guarantee is capped at 25% of the outstanding obligations of the special purpose subsidiary which is the primary obligor under the financing. In addition, Holdco has delivered a non-recourse carveout guarantee, which can trigger recourse to Holdco as a result of certain bad boy\u201d defaults for losses incurred by BMO Harris or the entire outstanding obligations of the financing borrower, depending on the nature of the bad boy\u201d default.\nExamples of bad boy\u201d defaults under the BMO Harris asset-specific financing include, without limitation: fraud; intentional misrepresentation; willful misconduct; incurrence of additional debt in violation of financing documents; and the filing of a voluntary or collusive involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of the special purpose entity subsidiary or the guarantor entity. The guarantee agreements for each of the asset-specific financings also contain financial covenants covering liquid assets and net worth requirements.\nNon-Consolidated Senior Interests\nIn certain instances, we create structural leverage through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third party. In either case, the senior mortgage loan (i.e., the non-consolidated senior interest) is not included on our balance sheet. When we create structural leverage through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third party, we retain on our balance sheet a mezzanine loan. As of December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding loans that we financed through the use of non-consolidated senior interests sold or co-originated in prior periods.\nFinancial Covenants for Outstanding Borrowings\nOn May 4, 2018, we amended and restated our financial covenants to align and simplify the financial covenants across the guarantees related to our secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, and asset-specific financings and to provide for additional leverage. The amended and restated agreements require Holdco to maintain compliance with the following financial covenants (among others):\n \u2022 Cash Liquidity: maintenance of minimum cash liquidity of no less than the greater of $10.0 million and 5.0% of Holdco's recourse indebtedness; \n \u2022 Tangible Net Worth: maintenance of minimum tangible net worth of at least 75% of the net cash proceeds of all prior equity issuances made by Holdco or the Company plus 75% of the net cash proceeds of all subsequent equity issuances made by Holdco or the Company; \n \u2022 Debt to Equity: maintenance of a debt to equity ratio not to exceed 3.5 to 1.0; and \n \u2022 Interest Coverage: maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio (EBITDA to interest expense) of no less than 1.5 to 1.0. \nThe Company believes it was in compliance with all covenants for its secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, term loan facility, and asset-specific financings as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio and Total Leverage Ratio\nThe following table presents our debt-to-equity ratio and total leverage ratio:\n\n (1) Represents (i) total outstanding borrowings under financing arrangements, net, including collateralized loan obligations, secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, a term loan facility, and an asset-specific financing agreement, less cash, to (ii) total stockholders' equity, at period end. \n (2) Represents (i) total outstanding borrowings under financing arrangements, net, including collateralized loan obligations, secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, a term loan facility, and an asset-specific financing agreement, plus non-consolidated senior interests sold or co-originated (if any), less cash, to (ii) total stockholders' equity, at period end. \nFloating Rate Portfolio\nOur business model seeks to minimize our exposure to changing interest rates by match-indexing our assets using the same, or similar, benchmark indices, typically LIBOR, as well as durations. Accordingly, rising interest rates will generally increase our net interest income, while declining interest rates will generally decrease our net interest income. As of December 31, 2018, 100.0% of our loans by unpaid principal balance earned a floating rate of interest and were financed with liabilities that require interest payments based on floating rates, which resulted in approximately $1.2 billion of net floating rate exposure that is positively correlated to rising interest rates, subject to the impact of interest rate floors on certain of our floating rate loans. We had no fixed rate loans outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nOur liabilities are generally index-matched to each collateral asset, resulting in a net exposure to movements in benchmark rates that vary based on the relative proportion of floating rate assets and liabilities. The following table details our portfolio's net floating rate exposure as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Floating rate mortgage loan assets and liabilities are indexed to LIBOR. The net exposure to the underlying benchmark interest rate is directly correlated to our assets indexed to the same rate. Excludes CMBS investments and related liabilities. \n (2) Floating rate liabilities include secured revolving repurchase agreements, collateralized loan obligations, senior secured and secured credit agreements, a term loan facility, and asset-specific financings. \nInterest-Earning Assets and Interest-Bearing Liabilities\nThe following table presents the average balance of interest-earning assets and related interest-bearing liabilities, associated interest income and expense, and financing costs and the corresponding weighted average yields for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those in this discussion as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Part, 1. Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nIntroduction\nWe are a commercial real estate finance company externally managed by TPG RE Finance Trust Management, L.P. and sponsored by TPG. We directly originate, acquire and manage commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate-related debt instruments in North America for our balance sheet. We operate our business as one segment.\nWe have made an election to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our initial taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We believe we have been organized and have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and we believe that our organization and current and intended manner of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. We operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain an exclusion or exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act.\n2018 Highlights\nOperating Results:\n \u2022 Generated GAAP net income of $106.9 million, an increase of $12.6 million, or 13.3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 Increased Core Earnings to $107.4 million, or $1.70 per share, an increase of $13.0 million, or 13.8%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 Declared dividends of $109.1 million, or $1.71 per share, representing a dividend yield of 8.7% on a Book Value per Common Share of $19.76 as of December 31, 2018. \nInvestment Portfolio Activity:\n \u2022 Originated 26 loans with a total commitment of $2.52 billion, an initial unpaid principal balance of $2.09 billion, unfunded commitments upon closing of $436.2 million, and a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.6%. \n \u2022 Funded $258.3 million in connection with existing loans having future funding obligations. \n \u2022 Received cash proceeds of $1.2 billion from principal repayments, including $2.6 million from loan sales. \nPortfolio Financing Activity:\n \u2022 Closed two collateralized loan obligations totaling $1.9 billion, financing 51 existing first mortgage loan investments, comprising 48 pari passu participation interests and three whole loans, significantly reducing cost of funds and increasing non-recourse, matched-term financing of the loan portfolio. \n \u2022 Closed a non-recourse term loan facility of up to $750 million and established a $160 million secured credit agreement to table fund new loan investments. \n \u2022 Raised gross proceeds of $138.7 million through an underwritten common stock offering of 7 million shares at a price of $19.82 per share. \nAvailable Liquidity:\n \u2022 At December 31, 2018, we had unrestricted cash available for investment of $39.7 million, a portion of which is subject to certain liquidity covenants, and CMBS investments with an aggregate face amount of $76.4 million available for sale. \n \u2022 At December 31, 2018, we had undrawn capacity (liquidity available to us without the need to pledge more collateral to our lenders) of $236.5 million under secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, and a term loan facility, with eight lenders: \n \u2022 $236.5 million of undrawn capacity in connection with our secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, and a term loan facility, with an aggregate maximum commitment amount of $4.0 billion and a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.0% as of December 31, 2018, providing stable financing, with mark-to-market provisions limited to asset and, in one instance, market specific events and a weighted average term to extended maturity (assuming we have exercised all extension options and term out provisions) of 3.4 years. \n \u2022 As of December 31, 2018, we had $2.6 billion of financing capacity under secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, and a term loan facility, provided by nine lenders. Our ability to draw on this capacity is dependent upon our lenders' willingness to accept as collateral loan or CMBS investments we pledge to them to secure additional borrowings: \n \u2022 $2.4 billion of financing capacity is available for loan investments under our secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, and a term loan facility for loan originations and acquisitions, with an aggregate maximum commitment amount of $4.0 billion and credit spreads based upon the LTV and other risk characteristics of collateral pledged, which together provide stable financing with mark-to-market provisions generally limited to asset and, in one instance, market specific events, and a weighted average term to extended maturity (assuming we have exercised all extension options and term out provisions) of 3.4 years. These financing arrangements are 25% and 100% recourse to Holdco. \n \u2022 $167.3 million of financing capacity is available for CMBS investments under two secured revolving repurchase agreements, with a maximum commitment amount of $200 million, credit spreads based upon the haircut and other risk characteristics of the collateral pledged, and a weighted average term to extended maturity (assuming we have exercised all extension options and term out provisions and have obtained the consent of our lenders) of 0.01 years (or approximately one month). These agreements are 100% recourse to Holdco. \nKey Financial Measures and Indicators\nAs a commercial real estate finance company, we believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are earnings per share, dividends declared per share, Core Earnings, and book value per share. For the three months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded earnings per share of $0.43, declared a dividend of $0.43 per share, and reported $0.43 per share of Core Earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded earnings per share of $1.70, declared dividends of $1.71 per share, and reported $1.70 per share of Core Earnings. In addition, our book value per common share as of December 31, 2018 was $19.76. As further described below, Core Earnings is a measure that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use Core Earnings to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan activity and operations.\nEarnings Per Common Share and Dividends Declared Per Common Share\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share and dividends declared per share (in thousands, except share and per share data):\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income Attributable to TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 106,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 94,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted Average Number of Common Shares\nOutstanding, Basic and Diluted(1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67,185,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,034,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,194,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic and Diluted Earnings per Common Share(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends Declared per Common Share(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Weighted average number of shares outstanding includes common stock and Class A common stock. \n (2) Share and per share data reflect the impact of the common stock and Class A common stock dividend which was paid upon completion of the Company's initial public offering on July 25, 2017 to holders of record as of July 3, 2017. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for details. \nCore Earnings\nWe use Core Earnings to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan activity and operations. Core Earnings is a non-GAAP measure, which we define as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to our stockholders, including realized gains and losses not otherwise included in GAAP net income (loss), and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) unrealized gains (losses), and (iv) certain non-cash items. Core Earnings may also be adjusted from time to time to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash charges as determined by our Manager, subject to approval by a majority of our independent directors. The exclusion of depreciation and amortization from the calculation of Core Earnings only applies to debt investments related to real estate to the extent we foreclose upon the property or properties underlying such debt investments.\nWe believe that Core Earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to our net income and cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Although pursuant to the Management Agreement we calculate the incentive and base management fees due to our Manager using Core Earnings before incentive fee expense, we report Core Earnings after incentive fee expense, because we believe this is a more meaningful presentation of the economic performance of our common and Class A common stock.\nCore Earnings does not represent net income or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, or an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operations, a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. In addition, our methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and accordingly, our reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to the Core Earnings reported by other companies.\nFor additional information on the fees we pay our Manager, see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders to Core Earnings (in thousands, except share and per share data):\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 106,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 94,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-Cash Compensation Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and Amortization Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized Gains (Losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 107,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 94,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted-Average Common Shares Outstanding, Basic\nand Diluted(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67,185,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,034,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,194,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Earnings per Common Share, Basic and Diluted(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents GAAP net income attributable to our common and Class A common stockholders. \n (2) Share and per share data reflect the impact of the common stock and Class A common stock dividend which was paid upon completion of the Company's initial public offering on July 25, 2017 to holders of record as of July 3, 2017.

Other loan fundings included $50.65 million of deferred fundings related to previously originated loan commitments. Proceeds from loan repayments during the three months ended December 31, 2018 totaled $367.9 million. We generated interest income of $71.7 million, incurred interest expense of $35.6 million, and generated net interest income of $36.1 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we originated 26 loans with a total loan commitment amount of $2.52 billion, of which $2.09 billion was funded at origination. Other loan fundings included $258.3 million of deferred fundings related to previously originated loan commitments. Proceeds from loan repayments and sales during the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.2 billion and $2.6 million, respectively, totaling $1.2 billion. We generated interest income of $265.6 million, incurred interest expense of $126.0 million, and generated net interest income of $139.6 million.\nThe following table details our loan activity by unpaid principal balance (dollars in thousands):\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan originations- initial funding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 452,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,085,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other loan fundings(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 258,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan repayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (367,872\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,225,927\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,564\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loan fundings, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 134,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,115,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Additional fundings made under existing loan commitments. \nThe following table details overall statistics for our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Loan Portfolio\nExposure\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Floating rate loans (by unpaid principal balance)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loan commitment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,947,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unpaid principal balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,313,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unfunded loan commitments(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 634,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carrying value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,293,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average credit spread(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average all-in yield(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average term to extended maturity (in years)(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average LTV(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Unfunded loan commitments may be funded over the term of each loan, subject in certain cases to an expiration date or a force-funding date, primarily to finance property improvements or lease-related expenditures by our borrowers, to finance operating deficits during renovation and lease-up, and in some instances to finance development. \n (2) As of December 31, 2018, our floating rate loans were indexed to LIBOR. In addition to credit spread, all-in yield includes the amortization of deferred origination fees, purchase price premium and discount, loan origination costs and accrual of both extension and exit fees. Credit spread and all-in yield for the total portfolio assumes the applicable floating benchmark rate as of December 31, 2018 for weighted average calculations. \n (3) Extended maturity assumes all extension options are exercised by the borrower; provided, however, that our loans may be repaid prior to such date. As of December 31, 2018, based on the unpaid principal balance of our total loan exposure, 76.8% of our loans were subject to yield maintenance or other prepayment restrictions and 23.2% were open to repayment by the borrower without penalty. \n (4) LTV is calculated as the total outstanding principal balance of the loan or participation interest in a loan plus any financing that is pari passu with or senior to such loan or participation interest as of December 31, 2018, divided by the applicable as-is real estate value at the time of origination or acquisition of such loan or participation interest in a loan. The as-is real estate value reflects our Manager's estimates, at the time of origination or acquisition of a loan or participation interest in a loan, of the real estate value underlying such loan or participation interest, determined in accordance with our Manager's underwriting standards and consistent with third-party appraisals obtained by our Manager. \nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for details about our mortgage loan originations subsequent to December 31, 2018.\nCMBS Portfolio\nWe invest from time to time in CMBS and CMBS-related assets as part of our investment strategy, often as a short-term cash management tool. As of December 31, 2018, our CMBS portfolio consisted of four fixed rate securities, the underlying collateral of which consists of first mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate properties. The underlying real estate collateral is located across the United States, primarily in California and Texas, with no state representing more than 24.3% of an investment's current face amount. Additionally, the payment of principal and interest on the securities in our CMBS portfolio at December 31, 2018 is guaranteed by a U.S. Government agency or a U.S. government sponsored enterprise ( GSE\u201d). At December 31, 2018, there were no floating rate securities in our CMBS Portfolio.\nThe following table details overall statistics for our CMBS portfolio as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> CMBS Investment\nExposure\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of CMBS investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed rate CMBS investments (by current face amount)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Par value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 77,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current face amount(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average coupon(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average yield to expected maturity(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average life (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average principal repayment window (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual maturity (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Ratings(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Unrated\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Amounts disclosed are before giving effect to unamortized purchase price premium and discount and unrealized gains or losses. \n (2) Weighted by market value as of December 31, 2018. \n (3) The largest structured finance investment is 100% collateralized by multifamily mortgage loans underwritten by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( FHLMC\u201d), which loans are slated for near term securitization by FHLMC. Upon the contractual maturity of the structured finance investment, FHLMC is required to purchase all of the performing mortgage loans at par. Currently, all of the underlying mortgage loans are performing. The other CMBS investments are structured finance investments issued by Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae which are backed primarily by mortgage loans on multifamily properties that satisfy GSE program requirements. These bonds are unrated but carry a government guaranty. \nAsset Management\nWe proactively manage the assets in our portfolio from closing to final repayment. We are party to an agreement with Situs Asset Management, LLC ( Situs\u201d), one of the largest commercial mortgage loan servicers, pursuant to which Situs provides us with dedicated asset management employees for performing asset management services pursuant to our proprietary guidelines. Following the closing of an investment, this dedicated asset management team rigorously monitors the investment under our Manager's oversight, with an emphasis on ongoing financial, legal and quantitative analyses. Through the final repayment of an investment, the asset management team maintains regular contact with borrowers, servicers and local market experts monitoring performance of the collateral, anticipating borrower, property and market issues, and enforcing our rights and remedies when appropriate.\nOur Manager reviews our entire loan portfolio quarterly, undertakes an assessment of the performance of each loan, and assigns it a risk rating between 1\u201d and 5,\u201d from least risk to greatest risk, respectively. See Notes 2 and 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for a discussion regarding the risk rating system that we use in connection with our portfolio.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, we also had outstanding non-consolidated senior interests of $96.4 million.\nThe following table details our portfolio financing outstanding principal balances (dollars in thousands):\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Portfolio Financing\nOutstanding Principal Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collateralized loan obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,522,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Secured revolving repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,044,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,835,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior secured and secured credit agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 460,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Term loan facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 114,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset-specific financings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 289,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total indebtedness(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,173,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,125,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Excludes deferred financing costs of $23.8 million and $10.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. \nCollateralized Loan Obligations\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we closed two collateralized loan obligations totaling $1.9 billion, financing 51 existing first mortgage loan investments, comprising 48 pari passu participation interests and three whole loans, significantly reducing our cost of funds and increasing to 52.1% the non-recourse, matched-term financing of our loan portfolio borrowings. The collateralized loan obligations bear a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.28%, weighted average advance rate of 79.7%, and in one instance includes a reinvestment feature that provides additional liquidity that allows us to originate new loan investments funded in part or in whole by the CLO. As of December 31, 2018, the loan investments contributed to the collateralized loan obligations represented 42.3% of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of our loan investment portfolio, or $1.8 billion.\nSecured Revolving Repurchase Agreements\nAs of December 31, 2018, aggregate borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving repurchase agreements related to loans totaled $1.0 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.0% per annum, a weighted average all-in cost of credit, including associated fees and expenses, of LIBOR plus 2.6% per annum, and a weighted average advance rate of 76.6%. As of December 31, 2018, outstanding borrowings under these agreements had a weighted average term to extended maturity (assuming we have exercised all extension options and term out provisions) of 3.1 years.\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had two secured revolving repurchase agreements to finance its CMBS investing activities. Credit spreads vary depending upon the CMBS investment and advance rate. Assets pledged at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 consisted of two and three mortgage-backed securities, respectively. These agreements are 100% recourse to Holdco. The agreements include various covenants covering net worth, liquidity, recourse limitations, and debt coverage, as further discussed below.\nThe following tables detail our secured revolving

Once we identify an asset and the asset is approved by the secured revolving repurchase agreement lender to serve as collateral (which lender's approval is in its sole discretion), we and the lender may enter into a transaction whereby the lender advances to us a percentage of the value of the asset, which is referred to as the advance rate,\u201d as the purchase price for such transaction with an obligation of ours to repurchase the asset from the lender for an amount equal to the purchase price for the transaction plus a price differential, which is calculated based on an interest rate. For each transaction, we and the lender agree to a trade confirmation which sets forth, among other things, the purchase price, the maximum advance rate, the interest rate, the market value of the loan asset and any future funding obligations which are contemplated with respect to the specific transaction and/or the underlying loan asset. For loan assets which involve future funding obligations of ours, the repurchase transaction may provide for the repurchase lender to fund portions (for example, pro rata per the maximum advance rate of the related repurchase transaction) of such future funding obligations. Generally, our secured revolving repurchase agreements allow for revolving balances, which allow us to voluntarily repay balances and draw again on existing available credit. The primary obligor on each secured revolving repurchase agreement is a separate special purpose subsidiary of ours which is restricted from conducting activity other than activity related to the utilization of its secured revolving repurchase agreement. As additional credit support, our holding company subsidiary, Holdco, provides certain guarantees of the obligations of its subsidiaries. The liability of Holdco under the guarantees related to our secured revolving repurchase agreements secured by CMBS is in an amount equal to 100% of the outstanding obligations of the special purpose subsidiary which is the primary obligor under the related agreement. The liability of Holdco under the guarantees related to our secured revolving repurchase agreements secured by loans is generally capped at 25% of the outstanding obligations of the special purpose subsidiary which is the primary obligor under the related agreement. However, such liability cap under the guarantees related to our secured revolving repurchase agreements secured by loans does not apply in the event of certain bad boy\u201d defaults which can trigger recourse to Holdco for losses or the entire outstanding obligations of the borrower depending on the nature of the bad boy\u201d default in question. Examples of such bad boy\u201d defaults include, without limitation, fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful misconduct, incurrence of additional debt in violation of financing documents, and the filing of a voluntary or collusive involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of the special purpose entity subsidiary or the guarantor entity.\nEach of the secured revolving repurchase agreements have margin maintenance\u201d provisions, which are designed to allow the repurchase lender to maintain a certain margin of credit enhancement against the loan assets which serve as collateral. The lender's margin amount is typically based on a percentage of the market value of the loan asset and/or mortgaged property collateral; however, certain secured revolving repurchase agreements may also involve margin maintenance based on maintenance of a minimum debt yield with respect to the cash flow from the underlying real estate collateral. Market value determinations and redeterminations may be made by the repurchase lender in its sole discretion subject to any specified parameters regarding the repurchase lender's determination, which may involve the limitation or enumeration of factors which the repurchase lender may consider when determining market value.\nAt December 31, 2018, the weighted average haircut (which is equal to one minus the advance rate percentage against collateral for our secured revolving repurchase agreements taken as a whole) was 23.0%, as compared to 25.9% at December 31, 2017.\nGenerally, when the repurchase lender's margin amount has fallen below the outstanding purchase price for a transaction, a margin deficit exists and the repurchase lender may require that we prepay outstanding amounts on the secured revolving repurchase agreement to eliminate such margin deficit. In certain secured revolving repurchase agreement, the repurchase lender's ability to make a margin call is further limited by certain prerequisites, such as the existence of enumerated credit events\u201d or that the margin deficit exceed a specified minimum threshold.\nThe secured revolving repurchase agreements also include cash management features which generally require that income from collateral loan assets be deposited in a lender-controlled account and be disbursed in accordance with a specified waterfall of payments designed to keep facility-related obligations current before such income is disbursed for our own account. The cash management features generally require the trapping of cash in such controlled account if an uncured default remains outstanding. Furthermore, some secured revolving repurchase agreements may require an accelerated principal amortization schedule if the secured revolving repurchase agreement is in its final extended term.\nNotwithstanding that a loan asset may be subject to a financing arrangement and serve as collateral under a secured revolving repurchase agreement, we are generally granted the right to administer and service the loan and interact directly with the underlying obligors and sponsors of our loan assets so long as there is no default under the secured revolving repurchase agreement and so long as we do not engage in certain material modifications (including amendments, waivers, exercises of remedies, or releases of obligors and collateral, among other things) of the loan assets without the repurchase lender's prior consent.\nSenior Secured and Secured Credit Agreements\nOn July 12, 2018, the Company entered into a secured credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), as borrower, with Citibank, N.A. as administrative agent and lender, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as sole lead arranger and sole lead book running manager. The Credit Agreement governs a secured revolving credit agreement with aggregate secured borrowing capacity of up to $160.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability and certain other conditions, which the Company occasionally uses to finance originations or acquisitions of eligible loans on an interim basis until permanent financing is arranged. The Credit Agreement has an initial maturity date of July 12, 2020, and borrowings bear interest at an interest rate per annum equal to one-month LIBOR or the applicable base rate plus a margin of 2.25%. The initial advance rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement with respect to individual pledged assets varies and can range up to 70%, and may decline over the borrowing term of up to a 90-day period, after which borrowings against that respective asset must be repaid.\nOn September 29, 2017, the Company and Bank of America N.A. entered into a senior secured credit agreement that had a maximum commitment amount of $250 million, which could be increased from time to time, up to $500 million, at the Company's request and agreement by the lender. The Company previously exercised its accordion feature to increase the maximum commitment amount to $500 million. The current extended maturity of this agreement is September 29, 2022.\nTerm Loan Facility\nOn December 21, 2018, the Company entered into a term loan facility, as borrower, with an institutional asset manager as the lender. The term loan facility has a commitment amount of up to $750 million, bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.85%, and allows for an advance rate of no less than 70% and up to 85% based on the loans pledged to the facility. As of December 31, 2018, the Company pledged one loan investment to the facility with an outstanding borrowing of $114.3 million.\nAsset-Specific Financings\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had outstanding one and seven loan investments financed with one and three separate counterparties, respectively, as asset-specific financings. In instances where we have multiple asset-specific financings with the same lender, the financings are not cross-collateralized.\nThe following table details statistics for our asset-specific financing at December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td> Lender\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Count\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Commitment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Principal\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Undrawn\nCapacity(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Carrying\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest\nRate(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Extended\nMaturity(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BMO Harris\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collateral asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> L+5.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 04/09/22\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing provided\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> L+2.65%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 04/09/22\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collateral Asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> L+5.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing Provided\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> L+2.65%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Undrawn capacity represents the positive difference between the borrowing amount approved by the lender against collateral assets pledged by us and the amount actually drawn against those collateral assets.

The liability of Holdco under this guarantee is capped at 25% of the outstanding obligations of the special purpose subsidiary which is the primary obligor under the financing. In addition, Holdco has delivered a non-recourse carveout guarantee, which can trigger recourse to Holdco as a result of certain bad boy\u201d defaults for losses incurred by BMO Harris or the entire outstanding obligations of the financing borrower, depending on the nature of the bad boy\u201d default.\nExamples of bad boy\u201d defaults under the BMO Harris asset-specific financing include, without limitation: fraud; intentional misrepresentation; willful misconduct; incurrence of additional debt in violation of financing documents; and the filing of a voluntary or collusive involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of the special purpose entity subsidiary or the guarantor entity. The guarantee agreements for each of the asset-specific financings also contain financial covenants covering liquid assets and net worth requirements.\nNon-Consolidated Senior Interests\nIn certain instances, we create structural leverage through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third party. In either case, the senior mortgage loan (i.e., the non-consolidated senior interest) is not included on our balance sheet. When we create structural leverage through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third party, we retain on our balance sheet a mezzanine loan. As of December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding loans that we financed through the use of non-consolidated senior interests sold or co-originated in prior periods.\nFinancial Covenants for Outstanding Borrowings\nOn May 4, 2018, we amended and restated our financial covenants to align and simplify the financial covenants across the guarantees related to our secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, and asset-specific financings and to provide for additional leverage. The amended and restated agreements require Holdco to maintain compliance with the following financial covenants (among others):\n \u2022 Cash Liquidity: maintenance of minimum cash liquidity of no less than the greater of $10.0 million and 5.0% of Holdco's recourse indebtedness; \n \u2022 Tangible Net Worth: maintenance of minimum tangible net worth of at least 75% of the net cash proceeds of all prior equity issuances made by Holdco or the Company plus 75% of the net cash proceeds of all subsequent equity issuances made by Holdco or the Company; \n \u2022 Debt to Equity: maintenance of a debt to equity ratio not to exceed 3.5 to 1.0; and \n \u2022 Interest Coverage: maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio (EBITDA to interest expense) of no less than 1.5 to 1.0. \nThe Company believes it was in compliance with all covenants for its secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, term loan facility, and asset-specific financings as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio and Total Leverage Ratio\nThe following table presents our debt-to-equity ratio and total leverage ratio:\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt-to-equity ratio(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.36x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.71\n</td> <td> x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total leverage ratio(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.36x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.82\n</td> <td> x\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents (i) total outstanding borrowings under financing arrangements, net, including collateralized loan obligations, secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, a term loan facility, and an asset-specific financing agreement, less cash, to (ii) total stockholders' equity, at period end. \n (2) Represents (i) total outstanding borrowings under financing arrangements, net, including collateralized loan obligations, secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, a term loan facility, and an asset-specific financing agreement, plus non-consolidated senior interests sold or co-originated (if any), less cash, to (ii) total stockholders' equity, at period end. \nFloating Rate Portfolio\nOur business model seeks to minimize our exposure to changing interest rates by match-indexing our assets using the same, or similar, benchmark indices, typically LIBOR, as well as durations. Accordingly, rising interest rates will generally increase our net interest income, while declining interest rates will generally decrease our net interest income. As of December 31, 2018, 100.0% of our loans by unpaid principal balance earned a floating rate of interest and were financed with liabilities that require interest payments based on floating rates, which resulted in approximately $1.2 billion of net floating rate exposure that is positively correlated to rising interest rates, subject to the impact of interest rate floors on certain of our floating rate loans. We had no fixed rate loans outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nOur liabilities are generally index-matched to each collateral asset, resulting in a net exposure to movements in benchmark rates that vary based on the relative proportion of floating rate assets and liabilities. The following table details our portfolio's net floating rate exposure as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Floating rate assets(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,313,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,195,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Floating rate debt(1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,140,968\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,125,288\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net floating rate exposure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,172,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,070,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Floating rate mortgage loan assets and liabilities are indexed to LIBOR.
