MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral Overview\nOur principal business is residential homebuilding and the development of lifestyle communities with operations geographically focused in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas. We serve a wide array of consumer groups from coast to coast, including first time, move-up, luxury, and active adult buyers, building single and multi family attached and detached homes. Our homebuilding company operates under our Taylor Morrison and Darling Homes brand names. We also have operations which provide financial services to customers through our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, Taylor Morrison Home Funding ( TMHF\u201d), and title services through our wholly owned title services subsidiary, Inspired Title Services, LLC ( Inspired Title\u201d). Our business is organized into multiple homebuilding operating components, and a financial services component, all of which are managed as four reportable segments: East, Central, West and Financial Services, as follows:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Jacksonville, Orlando, Raleigh, Southwest Florida, and Tampa\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Austin, Dallas, Denver, and Houston\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Bay Area, Phoenix, Sacramento, and Southern California\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>TMHF and Inspired Title\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Highlights and Recent Developments\nOur financial and operational highlights for the year ended December 31, 2018 and recent developments subsequent to the year end are summarized below:\nFinancial:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In January 2018, we completed our final series of public offerings and repurchases of our Class A common Stock from TPG and Oaktree, resulting in a fully floated public company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On January 26, 2018 we amended the maturity date of our Revolving Credit Facility from April 2019 to January 2022 allowing incremental financial flexibility.

Significant and unusual items also consists of costs and expenses related to the impacts of purchase accounting from the Acquisition and incremental warranty and impairment charges.\nIndustry Overview and Business Strategy\nWe believe the housing market continues to be driven by certain positive economic and demographic factors, including decreasing unemployment, strong home values, improving household balance sheets, declines in new and existing for-sale home inventory and interest rates which continue to remain low in comparison to historic rates. While we were encouraged by certain positive and improved trends during recent years, several challenges still exist, such as lingering under employment concerns, stagnation in real wages and real or perceived personal wealth, national and global economic uncertainty and uncertainty around the interest rate environment. We are additionally challenged by shortages in the labor supply, specifically as it relates to qualified tradespeople, and volatility in energy prices. Nevertheless, we believe we are in a relatively stable business cycle.\nOur approach in allocating capital and managing our land portfolio has been to acquire assets that have attractive characteristics, including good access to schools, shopping, recreation and transportation facilities. In connection with our overall land inventory management and investment process, our management team reviews these considerations, as well as other financial metrics, in order to decide the highest and best use of our capital.\nWe intend to maintain a consistent approach to land positioning within our regions, markets and communities in the foreseeable future in an effort to concentrate a greater amount of our land inventory in attractive areas. We also intend to continue to combine our land development expertise with our homebuilding operations to increase the flexibility of our business and to optimize our margin performance. From time to time, we may sell land in our communities if we believe it is best for our overall strategy and operations. We do not expect such sales to have a significant effect on our overall results, but they may impact our overall gross margins.\nFactors Affecting Comparability of Results\nThe Management's Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The primary factors that affect the comparability of our results of operations are the impacts of the Acquisition, transaction and corporate reorganization expenses, impairment and warranty charges, and Tax Act.\nOn October 2, 2018 we completed the Acquisition and incurred costs and expenses which primarily consist of investment banking fees, severance, compensation, and legal fees, among other items. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $30.8 million of such unusual costs and expenses in transaction and corporate reorganization expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, our homebuilding gross margin was impacted by purchase accounting. For the year ended December 31, 2018 we recognized a favorable adjustment in fair value for $5.4 million in Cost of home closings on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not incur or recognize transaction and corporate reorganization expenses or adjustments to the fair value of inventory.\nOn October 26, 2018, in connection with our corporate reorganization, all assets remaining in our Canadian subsidiary were contributed to a subsidiary in the United States. As a result, $20.1 million of unrecognized Accumulated other comprehensive loss on foreign currency translation was recognized as a component of Transaction and corporate reorganization expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, we recognized $15.3 million in non-resident Canadian withholding taxes from the Canada Unwind in Income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not incur or recognize corporate reorganization expenses or taxes associated with such reorganization.\nAs of December 31, 2018 we recognized an incremental $39.3 million warranty charge in our Central region. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not incur or recognize such warranty charge. Although we believe we have identified substantially all homes impacted by the repair issue, it is reasonably possible that the estimated liability will change as a result of our evaluation of potential changes in the estimated repair costs and the number of homes impacted.\nDuring 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation was enacted which made comprehensive reforms to the United States tax code, including a decrease to the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, and a mandatory deemed repatriation tax of foreign earnings at a reduced rate, that may be payable over eight years. Our effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2017 includes one-time tax expense charges of $57.4 million to account for the lower tax rate impact to our existing\ndeferred tax assets and $3.6 million for the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian operations in 2015.\nIn addition to the impact of the matters discussed in the Risk Factors listed in Item 1A of this Annual Report, our future results could differ materially from our historical results due to these changes.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), we have provided information in this Annual Report relating to adjusted net income,\u201d adjusted earnings per share,\u201d adjusted income before income taxes,\u201d net homebuilding debt to total capitalization ratio,\u201d and adjusted home closings gross margin.\u201d\nAdjusted net income (basic and diluted) and adjusted earnings per common share (basic and diluted) reflect the net income available to the Company excluding the impact of: significant and unusual transactions, transaction and corporate reorganization expenses, and the tax impact due to such items; the tax reform impact due to the revaluation of deferred assets and liabilities and due to the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings; and resulting adjustments to non-controlling interest. Adjusted income before income taxes reflects our income before income taxes excluding the impact of significant and unusual transactions and transaction and corporate reorganization expenses related to our acquisition of AV Homes and our internal corporate reorganization. Adjusted home closings gross margin is calculated based on GAAP home closings gross margin (which is inclusive of capitalized interest), excluding impairments (if any), warranty charges (if any) and purchase accounting adjustments. We calculate net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio by dividing (i) total debt, less unamortized debt issuance costs and mortgage warehouse borrowings, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, by (ii) total capitalization (the sum of net homebuilding debt and total stockholders' equity).\nManagement uses all of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our operational and economic performance and to set targets for performance-based compensation on a consolidated basis to compare to prior years which did not include such items. We believe that adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted income before income taxes are useful for investors in order to allow them to evaluate our operations without the effects of various items we do not believe are characteristic of our ongoing operations or performance and also because each assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. We believe that adjusted home closings gross margin is useful to investors because it allows investors to evaluate the performance of our homebuilding operations without the varying effects of impairment charges, certain warranty charges, and purchase accounting adjustments. We also use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to capitalization as an indicator of overall leverage and to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry. Because we use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to capitalization to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry, we believe this measure is also relevant and useful to investors for that reason. These measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures as a measure of our operating performance.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, impacting our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the recognition of income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The significant accounting policies that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are critical accounting policies and are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn January 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09\u201d or Topic 606\u201d), which provides new guidance for revenue recognition, and elected to use the modified retrospective approach to account for prior periods. The standard's core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\nHome and land closings revenue\nUnder Topic 606, the following steps are applied to determine the proper home closings revenue and land closings revenue recognition: (1) we identify the contract(s) with our customer; (2) we identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) we determine the transaction price; (4) we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) we recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation. For our home sales transactions, we have one contract, with one performance obligation, with each customer to build and deliver the home purchased (or develop and deliver land). Based on the application of the five steps, the following summarizes the timing and manner of home and land sales revenue:\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revenue from closings of residential real estate is recognized when closings have occurred, the buyer has made the required minimum down payment, obtained necessary financing, the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer, and we have no continuing involvement with the property, which is generally upon the close of escrow. Revenue is reported net of any discounts and incentives.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revenue from land sales is recognized when a significant down payment is received, title passes and collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have no continuing involvement with the property, which is generally upon the close of escrow.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmenity and other revenue\nAs a result of the Acquisition, we own and operate certain amenities, which require us to provide members with access to amenity facilities in exchange for the payment of club dues. We collect club dues and other fees from our members, which are billed on a monthly basis. Revenue from our golf club operations are also included in amenity revenue.\nFinancial services revenue\nMortgage operations and hedging activity related to financial services are not within the scope of Topic 606 and therefore there was no change to our accounting policies related to such activities. Loan origination fees (including title fees, points, and closing costs) are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. All of the loans TMHF originates are sold to third party investors within a short period of time, on a non-recourse basis. Gains and losses from the sale of mortgages are recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 860-20, Sales of Financial Assets. TMHF does not have continuing involvement with the transferred assets, therefore, we derecognize the mortgage loans at time of sale, based on the difference between the selling price and carrying value of the related loans upon sale, recording a gain/loss on sale in the period of sale. Also included in financial services revenue/expenses is the realized and unrealized gains and losses from hedging instruments.\nReal Estate Inventory Valuation and Costing\nInventory consists of raw land, land under development, homes under construction, completed homes, and model homes, all of which are stated at cost. In addition to direct carrying costs, we also capitalize interest, real estate taxes, and related development costs that benefit the entire community, such as field construction supervision and related direct overhead. Home vertical construction costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales at the time of home closing using the specific identification method. Land acquisition, development, interest, real estate taxes and overhead are allocated to homes and units using the relative sales value method. These costs are capitalized to inventory from the point development begins to the point construction is completed. Changes in estimated costs to be incurred in a community are generally allocated to the remaining lots on a prospective basis. For those communities that have been temporarily closed or development has been discontinued, we do not allocate interest or other costs to the community's inventory until activity resumes. Such costs are expensed as incurred.\nThe life cycle of the community generally ranges from two to five years, commencing with the acquisition of unentitled or entitled land, continuing through the land development phase and concluding with the sale, construction and delivery of homes. Actual community lives will vary based on the size of the community, the sales absorption rate and whether we purchased the property as raw land or as finished lots.\nWe capitalize qualifying interest costs to inventory during the development and construction periods. Capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales when the related inventory is delivered or when the related inventory is charged to cost of sales.\nWe assess the recoverability of our land inventory in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment.\u201d We review our real estate inventory for indicators of impairment by community during each reporting period. If indicators of impairment are present for a community, we first perform an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if the carrying value of the assets in that community exceeds the undiscounted cash flows. Generally, if the carrying value of the assets exceeds their estimated undiscounted cash flows, then the assets are deemed to be impaired and are recorded at fair value as of the assessment date. Our determination of fair value is primarily based on a discounted cash flow model which includes projections and estimates relating to sales prices, construction costs, sales pace, and other factors. Changes in these expectations may lead to a change in the outcome of our impairment analysis, and actual results may also differ from our assumptions.\nIn certain cases, we may elect to cease development and/or marketing of an existing community if we believe the economic performance of the community would be maximized by deferring development for a period of time to allow for market conditions to improve. We refer to such communities as long-term strategic assets. The decision may be based on financial and/or operational metrics as determined by us. If we decide to cease development, we will evaluate such project for impairment and then cease future development and marketing activity until such a time when we believe that market conditions have improved and economic performance can be maximized. Our assessment of the carrying value of our long-term strategic assets typically includes subjective estimates of future performance, including the timing of when development will recommence, the type of product to be offered, and the margin to be realized. In the future, some of these inactive communities may be re-opened while others may be sold.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into various specific performance agreements to acquire lots. Real estate not owned under these agreements is reflected in Real estate not owned with a corresponding liability in Liabilities attributable to real estate not owned in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInsurance Costs, Self-Insurance Reserves and Warranty Reserves\nWe have certain deductible amounts under our workers' compensation, automobile and general liability insurance policies, and we record expense and liabilities for the estimated costs of potential claims for construction defects. We also generally require our sub-contractors and design professionals to indemnify us and provide evidence of insurance for liabilities arising from their work, subject to certain limitations. Beneva Indemnity Company ( Beneva\u201d), one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, provides insurance coverage for construction defects discovered up to ten years following the closing of a home, premises operations risk and property coverage. We accrue for the expected costs associated with the deductibles and self-insured amounts under our various insurance policies based on historical claims, estimates for claims incurred but not reported, and potential for recovery of costs from insurance and other sources. The estimates are subject to significant variability due to various factors, such as claim settlement patterns, litigation trends and the length of time in which a construction defect claim might be made after the closing of a home.\nWe offer a limited warranty to cover various defects in workmanship or materials, including structural defects. We may also facilitate a longer warranty in certain markets or to comply with regulatory requirements. Warranty reserves are recorded as each home closes in an amount estimated to be adequate to cover expected future costs of materials and outside labor during warranty periods. Our warranty is not considered a separate deliverable in each sale arrangement, so it is accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies.\u201d In accordance with ASC 450, warranties that are not separately priced are generally accounted for by accruing the estimated costs to fulfill the warranty obligation. Thus, the warranty would not be considered a separate deliverable in the arrangement since it is not priced apart from the home. As a result, we accrue the estimated costs to fulfill the warranty obligation in accordance with ASC 450 at the time a home closes, as a component of cost of home closings.\nOur reserves are based on factors that include an actuarial study for historical and anticipated claims, trends related to similar product types, number of home closings, and geographical areas. We also provide third-party warranty coverage on homes where required by Federal Housing Administration or Veterans Administration lenders. We regularly review the reasonableness and adequacy of our reserves and make adjustments to the balance of the preexisting reserves to reflect changes in trends and historical data as information becomes available. Self-insurance and warranty reserves are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities and Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)\nWe are involved in joint ventures with related and unrelated third parties for homebuilding and development activities. We use the equity method of accounting for entities over which we exercise significant influence but do not have a controlling interest over the operating and financial policies of the investee. For unconsolidated entities in which we function as the managing\nmember, we have evaluated the rights held by our joint venture partners and determined that they have substantive participating rights that preclude the presumption of control. For joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, our share of net earnings or losses is included in equity in income of unconsolidated entities when earned and distributions are credited against its investment in the joint venture when received. These joint ventures are recorded in investments in unconsolidated entities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for indicators of impairment. A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity has occurred which is other-than-temporary. The amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investment's carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Additionally, we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is other-than-temporary. These factors include age of the venture, stage in its life cycle, our intent and ability to recover our investment in the unconsolidated entity, financial condition and long-term prospects of the unconsolidated entity, short-term liquidity needs of the unconsolidated entity, trends in the general economic environment of the land, entitlement status of the land held by the unconsolidated entity, overall projected returns on investment, defaults under contracts with third parties (including bank debt), recoverability of the investment through future cash flows and relationships with the other partners. If the Company believes that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, then no impairment is recorded.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes. Lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal initial capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development. In accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation,\u201d we have concluded that when we enter into an option or purchase agreement to acquire land or lots and pay a non-refundable deposit, a VIE may be created because we are deemed to have provided subordinated financial support that will absorb some or all of an entity's expected losses if they occur. If we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we will consolidate the VIE in our Consolidated Financial Statements and reflect such assets and liabilities as real estate not owned under option agreements within our inventory balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe have issued stock options, performance based restricted stock units and non-performance based restricted stock units, which we account for in accordance with ASC Topic 718-10, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\u201d The fair value for stock options is measured and estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognized evenly over the vesting period of the options. Performance-based restricted stock units are measured using the closing price on the date of grant and expensed using a probability of attainment calculation which determines the likelihood of achieving the performance targets. Non-performance-based restricted stock units are time based awards and measured using the closing price on the date of grant and are expensed over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.\nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of both temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. As a result of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, we have recorded a material charge to earnings in the period ending December 31, 2017. See Note 12 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 740-10, Income Taxes,\u201d we evaluate our deferred tax assets by tax jurisdiction, including the benefit from net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards by tax jurisdiction, to determine if a valuation allowance is required. Companies must assess, using significant judgments, whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not\u201d standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the length of statutory carryforward periods, experience with operating losses and experience of utilizing tax credit carryforwards and tax planning alternatives.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands, except per share information)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home closings revenue, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,115,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,799,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,425,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land closings revenue\n</td> <td>39,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial services revenue\n</td> <td>67,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amenity and other revenue\n</td> <td>4,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,227,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,885,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,550,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of home closings\n</td> <td>3,410,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,092,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,801,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of land closings\n</td> <td>33,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial services expenses\n</td> <td>41,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amenity and other expenses\n</td> <td>3,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,489,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,146,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,869,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>738,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>738,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>680,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales, commissions and other marketing costs\n</td> <td>278,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>138,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in income of unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>(13,332\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,846\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,453\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net\n</td> <td>(1,639\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(577\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(184\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>11,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction and corporate reorganization expenses\n</td> <td>50,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>273,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>355,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>314,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>63,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income before allocation to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>206,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to non-controlling interests -

Product and geographic mix among all divisions within the region contributed to the overall increase in average selling prices. The decrease in net sales orders was due to a lower sales pace for the region in the current year.\nCentral:\nThe number of net homes sold and sales value of homes increased by 12.8% and 15.7%, respectively, in 2018 as compared to 2017. A significant portion of the increase in units and sales value is driven by our Houston market, which was negatively impacted in the prior year as a result of Hurricane Harvey which occurred during the third quarter of 2017. Other markets within this region continue to strengthen their performance and contributed to the overall increase in units and dollars for the segment.\nWest:\nThe average selling price of net sales orders increased by 2.0% while the number of homes sold remained relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Strong demand combined with reduced supply in our Northern California markets drove the overall increase in average selling prices for the region.\nSales Order Cancellations Table 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Cancellation Rate (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central\n</td> <td>13.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Company\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Cancellation rate represents the number of canceled sales orders divided by gross sales orders.\nThe total company cancellation rate increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

However, in some locations where we act as a developer, we occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned parcels or areas designated for school or government use, which we typically sell to commercial developers or municipalities, as applicable. We also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply on larger tracts of land. Land and lot sales occur at various intervals and varying degrees of profitability. Therefore, the revenue and gross margin from land closings will fluctuate from period to period, depending on market opportunities. Land closings revenue was $39.9 million and $17.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The increase in land closings revenue in the West region was due to the sale of certain long-term strategic assets in the current year.\nAmenity and Other Revenue\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of the Acquisition of AV Homes, our East region includes communities which operate certain amenities such as community and golf clubs.

The decrease in the current year compared to the prior year was primarily the result of increased financial sector competition impacting pricing and a devaluation of our open pipeline due to rising interest rates, partially offset by an increase in title services revenue driven by the expansion of our title services to North and South Carolina.\nSales, Commissions and Other Marketing Costs\nSales commissions and other marketing costs, as a percentage of home closings revenue, remained flat for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 due to sustained leverage as a result of previous process efficiencies we made in our sales and marketing functions.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home closings revenue, remained flat for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, attributable our efforts to utilize our scalable platform, providing leverage with existing infrastructure to maintain stable operating costs.\nEquity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities\nEquity in income of unconsolidated entities was $13.3 million and $8.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The change was primarily due to an increase in closings in our homebuilding unconsolidated joint ventures as they mature in their life cycle.\nInterest Income, net\nInterest income, net was $1.6 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest income, net includes interest earned on cash balances offset by interest incurred but not capitalized on our long-term debt and other borrowings.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $11.8 million and $2.3 million, respectively. The current year balance included higher pre-acquisition costs on abandoned land projects and higher captive insurance claims than in the prior year.\nTransaction and corporate reorganization expenses\nTransaction and corporate reorganization expenses in the current year was comprised of approximately $30.8 million in Acquisition related costs, which include investment banking fees, severance, compensation and legal fees. In addition, the recognition of approximately $20.1 million of realized foreign currency losses from the Canada Unwind were also included in transaction and corporate reorganization expenses.\nIncome Tax Provision\nOur effective tax rate was 23.0% and 50.3% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was favorably impacted by the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the Tax Act, the relevant provisions of which became effective on January 1, 2018. The 2017 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the Tax Act, primarily due to the revaluation of existing deferred tax assets and the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian business in 2015.\nNet Income\nNet income before allocation to non-controlling interests and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $210.5 million and $1.83, respectively. Net income before allocation to non-controlling interests and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $176.7 million and $1.47, respectively. The increase in net income and diluted earnings per share from the prior year is primarily attributable to higher home closings revenue, net as a result of an increase in the number of homes closed, as well as a decrease in our income tax provision due to a lower effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nAverage Active Selling Communities\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East\n</td> <td>130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage active selling communities for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by 3.9% when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily driven by the West region which experienced higher sales orders in the first half of 2017 resulting in an increase in the number of community close outs.

Product and geographic mix among all divisions within the region contributed to the overall increase in in net homes sold and sales value. Certain divisions experienced an increase in sales price along with an increase in net homes sold, while others maintained their sales price and increased the number of net homes sold.\nCentral:\nThe number of net homes sold and sales value of homes increased by 15.2% and 15.0%, respectively, in 2017 as compared to 2016. A significant portion of the increase in units and sales value is driven by our Houston market which has shown improvements from the past two years' soft economic environment, despite the impacts of Hurricane Harvey which occurred during the third quarter of 2017. Other markets within this region continue to strengthen their performance in 2017 compared to 2016 and contributed to the overall increase in units and dollars for the segment as well.\nWest:\nThe average selling price increased by 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The markets in this region showed continued strength as evidenced by a 24.3% increase in sales pace. In 2017, we increased our focus on turn times and combined with our limited product availability as a result of the increase in the number of community close outs, the number of net homes sold decreased slightly in 2017 compared to 2016. The value of the net sales orders increased by 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year.\nSales Order Cancellations Table 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Cancellation Rate (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Company\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Cancellation rate represents the number of canceled sales orders divided by gross sales orders.\nFavorable market conditions coupled with increased demand for new housing has led to lower cancellation rates across all of our regions for the year ended December 31, 2017.

However, in some locations where we act as a developer, we occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned parcels or areas designated for school or government use, which we typically sell to commercial developers or municipalities, as applicable. We also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply on larger tracts of land. Land and lot sales occur at various intervals and varying degrees of profitability. Therefore, the revenue and gross margin from land closings will fluctuate from period to period, depending on market opportunities. Land closings revenue was $17.1 million and $64.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The year ended December 31, 2016 was significantly higher as we were able to capitalize on certain market conditions relative to our long-term strategic assets. The sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 represent legacy land that we held for either appreciation or tax purposes.\nSegment Home Closings Gross Margins\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Central\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>West\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home closings revenue, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,377,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,119,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,102,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,099,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,319,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,206,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,799,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,425,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of home closings\n</td> <td>1,094,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>892,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>899,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>902,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,098,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,006,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,092,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,801,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home closings gross margin\n</td> <td>283,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>197,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>706,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>623,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home closings gross margin %\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEast:\nHome closings gross margin percentage increased to 20.6% from 20.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily as a result of product and geographic mix. All divisions in the East experienced an increase in the number of homes closed and several of our markets also experienced an increase in the average sales price, which led to an increase in home closings gross margin. However, certain markets within the region experienced an increase in land development cost which partially offset the increase in home closings revenue net, causing a moderate increase in home closings gross margin percent.\nCentral:\nHome closings gross margin percentage increased to 18.4% from 18.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. Several markets within the Central region experienced a decrease in construction costs and an increase in rebates from our regional and national vendor program. The net decrease in costs of home closings partially contributed to the increase in home closings gross margin percentage. In addition, geographical mix within the region further contributed to the overall increase for 2017.\nWest:\nHome closings gross margin percentage increased to 16.7% from 16.6% for the years ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. Several markets within this region experienced an increase in the number of homes closed, average sales price, and homes closing revenue, net. During 2017, we experienced efficiencies from procurement and operational enhancements, which also contributed to the increase in home closings gross margin. However, we also experienced an increase in land development costs of the homes closed in 2017 compared to those closed in 2016, which partially offset our enhancements.\nFinancial Services\nOur Financial Services segment provides mortgage lending through our subsidiary, TMHF, and title service through our subsidiary, Inspired Title. The following details the number of loans closed, net income per closed loan, the aggregate value, capture rate, and average FICO on our loans for the following periods:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Closed Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Profit per Closed Loan (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Aggregate\nLoan Volume\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Capture\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average FICO\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>4,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,590.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>745\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>4,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,492.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>743\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Excludes hedging gain/loss\nOur net income per closed loan, excluding the derivative asset, increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 in the prior year primarily due to the increase in the average loan amount which is a result of the increase in average selling price of homes closed.\nOur mortgage capture rate represents the percentage of our homes sold to a home purchaser that utilized a mortgage and for which the borrower obtained such mortgage from TMHF or one of our preferred third party lenders. The decrease in our capture rate in 2017 versus 2016 is primarily due to increased competition for new home mortgages.\nSales, Commissions and Other Marketing Costs\nSales commissions and other marketing costs, as a percentage of home closings revenue, decreased period over period to 6.8% from 7.0% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease is primarily driven by efficiencies we have achieved as a result of previous investments we have made in our sales and marketing functions. In addition, the prior year period had higher sales and marketing costs as a result of our acquired divisions and an increase in new communities which typically have incremental startup costs during their early stages.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home closings revenue, decreased period over period to 3.4% from 3.6% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease was attributable to increased home closings revenue in addition to gaining leverage on existing infrastructure to maintain stable operating costs.\nEquity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities\nEquity in income of unconsolidated entities was $8.8 million and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the number of active unconsolidated joint ventures and the timing of openings. We had six unconsolidated joint ventures which were open and active for the full year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had five unconsolidated joint ventures which were active all year with the sixth unconsolidated joint venture opening in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nInterest Income, net\nInterest income, net includes interest earned on cash balances offset by interest incurred but not capitalized on our long-term debt and other borrowings. Interest income, net for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was consistent.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $2.3 million and $11.9 million, respectively. The prior year balance included higher accruals for contingent consideration relating to our acquisitions and pre-acquisition costs on abandoned land projects.\nUS Tax Reform\nThe Tax Act made comprehensive reforms to the United States tax code, including a decrease to the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, and a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax of foreign earnings at a reduced rate that may be, payable over eight years.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an estimated income tax expense of $57.4 million to account for the lower tax rate impact to our existing deferred tax assets. In addition, we recorded an estimated $3.6 million charge related to the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian operations in 2015.\nIncome Tax Provision\nOur effective tax rate was 50.3% and 34.3% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The Tax Act made comprehensive reforms to the United States tax code, including a decrease to the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings at a reduced tax rate that that may be payable over eight years.\nIn response to the Tax Act, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act. SAB 118 allows for the recording provisional amounts during a one year measurement period\u201d similar to that used when accounting for business combinations, if the Company has a reasonable estimate of the impact but the accounting is not yet complete. The measurement period is deemed to have ended in either one calendar year or when the Company has obtained, prepared and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting for the impact of the Tax Act, whichever is earlier.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a discrete net tax expense of $61.0 million related to impacts related to the Tax Act. The net expense included $57.4 million expense related to the write-down of our existing deferred tax assets to reflect the newly enacted U.S. federal tax rate, in accordance with SAB 118. The provisional expense was the Company's best estimate of the deferred tax asset write-down at December 31, 2017.\nThe net expense related to the Tax Act recorded during the period ended December 31, 2017, also included $3.6 million expense from the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian business in 2015. The Tax Act imposes a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on post-1986 earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) of certain foreign subsidiaries to their 10% U.S. shareholders (regardless of whether such E&P is distributed) at a rate of 15.5% for U.S. corporate shareholders to the extent E&P does not exceed the U.S. shareholder's aggregate foreign cash position (as defined in the Tax Act) and 8% for E&P in excess of such cash position. The resulting tax may be payable over eight years. The mandatory tax is partially offset by foreign tax credits generated by cash taxes that our Canadian subsidiaries previously paid. To determine the amount of the foreign repatriation tax, we determined, in addition to other factors, the amount of E&P of the subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. The provisional expense was the Company's best estimate as of December 31, 2017 of the foreign repatriation tax at that time.\nOur effective rate for both years was affected by a number of factors, the most significant of which included the Tax Act, state income taxes, the establishment of reserves for uncertain tax positions, adjustments to state net operating losses, changes in valuation allowances, and preferential treatment of certain deductions and energy credits relating to homebuilding activities.\nNet Income\nNet income and earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $176.7 million and $1.47, respectively. Net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $206.6 million and $1.69, respectively. Adjusting for the tax reform impact, the increase in net income and earnings per share from the prior year is attributable to an increase in margin dollars as a result of the increase in both the number of homes closed and average selling price of homes closed.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe finance our operations through the following:\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our various series of Senior Notes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Mortgage warehouse facilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Project-level real estate financing (including non-recourse loans);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Performance, payment and completion surety bonds, and letters of credit; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cash generated from operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that we can fund our current and foreseeable liquidity needs for the next 12 months from:\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cash generated from operations; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe may also access the capital markets to obtain additional liquidity through debt and equity offerings on an opportunistic basis. Our principal uses of capital for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were land purchases, lot development, home construction, operating expenses, payment of debt service, income taxes, investments in joint ventures, repurchase of Class A Common Stock, and the payment of various liabilities. In addition, all net proceeds from our equity offerings during 2018 and 2017, were used to purchase partnership units in New TMM along with shares of our Class B common stock, held by our Former Principal Equityholders. During the first quarter of 2018, capital was also used to purchase partnership units in New TMM shares and shares of our Class B Common Stock from TPG and Oaktree.\nCash flows for each of our communities depend on the status of the development cycle, and can differ substantially from reported earnings. Early stages of development or expansion require significant cash expenditures for land acquisitions, on and off-site development, construction of model homes, general landscaping and other amenities. Because these costs are a component of our inventory and are not recognized in our statement of operations until a home closes, we incur significant cash outflows prior to recognition of earnings.\nThe table below summarizes our total cash and liquidity as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Cash, excluding Restricted Cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>329,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>573,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>600,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total 364-Day Credit Agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of Credit Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62,315\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47,126\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving Credit Facility Borrowings Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>364-Day Credit Agreement Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(200,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving Credit Facility Availability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>537,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>452,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>867,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,026,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flow Activities\nOperating Cash Flow Activities\nOur net cash provided by operating activities was $135.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $386.2 million provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in spending on real estate inventory and land deposits, partially offset by an increase in the number of homes closed and a lower effective tax rate resulting in higher net income.\nInvesting Cash Flow Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $159.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $36.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The primary driver of the change between periods was payment for our acquisition of AV Homes in the current year.\nFinancing Cash Flow Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $219.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to cash used in financing activities of $76.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The cash used in financing activities in 2018\nwas primarily attributable to repurchases of New TMM Units from TPG and Oaktree as part of our public equity offerings\ncompleted in January, repurchases of common stock and repayment of the convertible notes. These were partially offset by borrowings on our 364-Day Credit facility in connection with the acquisition of AV Homes.\nDebt Instruments\nSenior Notes:\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding senior unsecured notes (collectively, the Senior Notes\u201d), as of December 31, 2018.\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Date Issued\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Principal\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Initial Offering\nPrice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Original Net Proceeds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Original Debt\nIssuance\nCost\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes due 2021\n</td> <td>April 16, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>550,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.250\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>541,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes due 2022\n</td> <td>October 2, 2018(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.625\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes due 2023\n</td> <td>April 16, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.875\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>345,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes due 2024\n</td> <td>March 5, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.625\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>345,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,650,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,232,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Reflects the date the notes were assumed in connection with the Acquisition.\nSenior Notes due 2021\nOn April 16, 2013, we issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2021 (the 2021 Senior Notes\u201d).\nThe 2021 Senior Notes mature on April 15, 2021. The 2021 Senior Notes are guaranteed by TMM Holdings, Taylor Morrison Holdings, Inc., Taylor Morrison Communities II, Inc. and their homebuilding subsidiaries (collectively, the Guarantors\u201d), which are all subsidiaries directly or indirectly of TMHC. The 2021 Senior Notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and are not subject to registration rights. The indenture for the 2021 Senior Notes contains covenants that limit (i) the making of investments, (ii) the payment of dividends and the redemption of equity and junior debt, (iii) the incurrence of additional indebtedness, (iv) asset dispositions, (v) mergers and similar corporate transactions, (vi) the incurrence of liens, (vii) prohibitions on payments and asset transfers among the issuers and restricted subsidiaries and (viii) transactions with affiliates, among others. The indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes contains customary events of default. If we do not apply the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales within specified deadlines, we will be required to offer to repurchase the 2021 Senior Notes at par (plus accrued and unpaid interest) with such proceeds. We are also required to offer to repurchase the 2021 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest) upon certain change of control events.\nThe 2021 Senior Notes are redeemable at scheduled redemption prices, currently at 101.313%, of their principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest).\nThere are no financial maintenance covenants for the 2021 Senior Notes.\nSenior Notes due 2022\nOn October 2, 2018, in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition, we assumed $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2022 (the \"2022 Senior Notes\"). The carrying value of $411.7 million at December 31, 2018 reflects the acquisition fair value adjustment of the debt instrument, net of amortization.\nThe 2022 Senior Notes mature on May 15, 2022. The 2022 Senior Notes are guaranteed by the same Guarantors that guarantee our other Senior Notes. The 2022 Senior Notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and are not subject to registration rights. The indenture governing the 2022 Senior Notes contains covenants that limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. The indenture governing the 2022 Senior Notes contains customary events of default that are similar to those contained in the indentures governing our other Senior Notes. We are also required to offer to repurchase the 2022 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest) upon certain change of control events.\nPrior to May 15, 2019, the 2022 Senior Notes are redeemable at a price equal to 100% plus a make-whole\u201d premium for payments through May 15, 2019 (plus accrued and unpaid interest). Beginning on May 15, 2019, the 2022 Senior Notes are redeemable at 103.313% of principal (plus accrued and unpaid interest), beginning on May 15, 2020, the 2022 Senior Notes are redeemable at 101.656% of principal (plus accrued and unpaid interest) and beginning on May 21, 2021, the 2022 Senior Notes are redeemable at 100% of principal (plus accrued and unpaid interest).\nThere are no financial maintenance covenants for the 2022 Senior Notes.\nSenior Notes due 2023\nOn April 16, 2015, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2023 (the 2023 Senior Notes\u201d). The 2023 Senior Notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and are not subject to registration rights.\nThe 2023 Senior Notes mature on April 15, 2023. The 2023 Senior Notes are guaranteed by the same Guarantors that guarantee our other Senior Notes. The indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes contains covenants that limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. The indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes contains events of default that are similar to those contained in the indentures governing our other Senior Notes. The change of control provisions in the indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes are similar to those contained in the indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes, but a credit rating downgrade must occur in connection with the change of control before the repurchase offer requirement is triggered for the 2023 Senior Notes.\nPrior to January 15, 2023, the 2023 Senior Notes are redeemable at a price equal to 100% plus a make-whole\u201d premium for payments through January 15, 2023 (plus accrued and unpaid interest). Beginning January 15, 2023, the 2023 Senior Notes are redeemable at par (plus accrued and unpaid interest).\nThere are no financial maintenance covenants for the 2023 Senior Notes.\nSenior Notes due 2024\nOn March 5, 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Senior Notes\u201d).\nThe 2024 Senior Notes mature on March 1, 2024. The 2024 Senior Notes are guaranteed by the same Guarantors that guarantee our other Senior Notes. The 2024 Senior Notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and are not subject to registration rights. The indenture governing the 2024 Senior Notes contains covenants that limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions similar to the 2023 Senior Notes. The indenture governing the 2024 Senior Notes contains events of default that are similar to those contained in the indentures governing our other Senior Notes. The change of control provisions in the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Notes are similar to those contained in the indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes.\nPrior to December 1, 2023, the 2024 Senior Notes are redeemable at a price equal to 100% plus a make-whole\u201d premium for payments through December 1, 2023 (plus accrued and unpaid interest). Beginning on December 1, 2023, the 2024 Senior Notes are redeemable at par (plus accrued and unpaid interest).\nThere are no financial maintenance covenants for the 2024 Senior Notes.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn January 26, 2018, we amended the Revolving Credit Facility to extend the maturity date from April 12, 2019 to January 26, 2022. On June 29, 2018, we further amended the Revolving Credit Facility to increase the amount available to $600.0 million. Other immaterial changes were also made to the structure of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by the same Guarantors that guarantee the Senior Notes.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains certain springing\u201d financial covenants, requiring us and our subsidiaries to comply with a maximum debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 0.60 to 1.00 and a minimum consolidated tangible net worth level of at least $1.8 billion. The financial covenants would be in effect for any fiscal quarter during which any (a) loans under the Revolving Credit Facility are outstanding during the last day of such fiscal quarter or on more than five separate days\nduring such fiscal quarter or (b) undrawn letters of credit (except to the extent cash collateralized) issued under the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount greater than $40.0 million or unreimbursed letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility are outstanding on the last day of such fiscal quarter or for more than five consecutive days during such fiscal quarter.\nFor purposes of determining compliance with the financial covenants for any fiscal quarter, the Revolving Credit Facility provides that we may exercise an equity cure by issuing certain permitted securities for cash or otherwise recording cash contributions to our capital that will, upon the contribution of such cash to the borrower, be included in the calculation of consolidated tangible net worth and consolidated total capitalization. The equity cure right is exercisable up to twice in any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and up to five times overall.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains certain restrictive covenants including limitations on incurrence of liens, dividends and other distributions, asset dispositions and investments in entities that are not guarantors, limitations on prepayment of subordinated indebtedness and limitations on fundamental changes. The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary events of default, subject to applicable grace periods, including for nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts, violation of covenants (including financial covenants, subject to the exercise of an equity cure), incorrectness of representations and warranties in any material respect, cross default and cross acceleration, bankruptcy, material monetary judgments, ERISA events with material adverse effect, actual or asserted invalidity of material guarantees and change of control. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n364-Day Credit Agreement\nOn October 2, 2018, we entered into a 364-Day Credit Agreement in respect of a term loan facility under which we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million, to facilitate the Acquisition. The 364-Day Credit Agreement matures on October 1, 2019.\nWe may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the 364-Day Credit Agreement at any time, without prepayment premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage\u201d costs with respect to LIBOR loans.\nThe 364-Day Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants, requiring us and our subsidiaries to comply on a quarterly basis with a maximum debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 0.60 to 1.00 and a minimum consolidated tangible net worth level of at least $1.8 billion.\nMortgage Warehouse Borrowings\nThe following is a summary of our mortgage subsidiary warehouse borrowings:\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility\n</td> <td>Amount\nDrawn\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Facility\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expiration Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Collateral (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warehouse A\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 1.75%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>On Demand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mortgage Loans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warehouse B\n</td> <td>38,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 1.75%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>On Demand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mortgage Loans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warehouse C\n</td> <td>62,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 1.95%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>On Demand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mortgage Loans and Restricted Cash\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>230,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility\n</td> <td>Amount\nDrawn\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Facility\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expiration Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Collateral (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warehouse A\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 2.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30 days written notice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mortgage Loans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warehouse B\n</td> <td>41,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 2.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>On Demand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mortgage Loans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warehouse C\n</td> <td>64,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 2.375%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 24, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mortgage Loans and Restricted Cash\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The mortgage warehouse borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, are collateralized by $181.9 million and $187.0 million, respectively, of mortgage loans held for sale, which comprise the balance of mortgage receivables, and $1.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively, of cash, which is restricted cash on our balance sheet.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Loans Payable and Other Borrowings\nLoans payable and other borrowings as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 consist of project-level debt due to various land sellers and seller financing notes from current and prior year acquisitions. Project-level debt is generally secured by the land that was acquired and the principal payments generally coincide with corresponding project lot sales or a principal reduction schedule. Loans payable bear interest at rates that ranged from 0% to 8% at December 31, 2018 and 2017. We impute interest for loans with no stated interest rates.\nLetters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Financial Guarantees\nThe following table summarizes our letters of credit and surety bonds as of the dates indicated:\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Surety bonds\n</td> <td>334,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>397,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>331,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there was $160.0 million and $200 million, respectively, total capacity of letters of credit available under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nContractual Obligations as of December 31, 2018\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized tax benefit obligations including interest and penalties\n</td> <td>3,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land purchase contracts and lot options\n</td> <td>393,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>364-Day Credit Agreement (1)\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes (1)\n</td> <td>1,650,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>550,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other debt outstanding (1)\n</td> <td>355,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>242,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest expense (2)\n</td> <td>431,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,073,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>785,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>974,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>894,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>418,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2018 total debt outstanding included $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the 364-Day Credit Agreement, $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Senior Notes, $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Senior Notes, $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Senior Notes, $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Notes, $130.4 million of mortgage borrowings by TMHF, and $225.5 million of loans and other borrowings.

The use of these entities, in some instances, enables us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or\ncould not obtain access on terms that are as favorable. Our partners in these joint ventures historically have been land owners/developers, other homebuilders and financial or strategic partners. Joint ventures with land owners/developers have given us access to sites owned or controlled by our partners. Joint ventures with other homebuilders have provided us with the ability to bid jointly with our partners for large or expensive land parcels. Joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to\ncombine our homebuilding expertise with access to our partners' capital. In certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures, we enter into loan agreements, whereby one of our subsidiaries will provide the lenders with customary guarantees, including completion, indemnity and environmental guarantees subject to usual non-recourse terms.\nThe following is a summary of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures:\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central\n</td> <td>35,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>100,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Services\n</td> <td>4,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLand Purchase and Land Option Contracts\nWe enter into land purchase and option contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes in the ordinary course of business. Lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding land purchase and lot option contracts of $393.8 million for 4,781 lots. We are obligated to close the transaction under our land purchase contracts. However, our obligations with respect to the option contracts are generally limited to the forfeiture of the related non-refundable cash deposits and/or letters of credit provided to obtain the options.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral Overview\nOur principal business is residential homebuilding and the development of lifestyle communities with operations geographically focused in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas. We serve a wide array of consumer groups from coast to coast, including first time, move-up, luxury, and active adult buyers, building single and multi family attached and detached homes. Our homebuilding company operates under our Taylor Morrison and Darling Homes brand names. We also have operations which provide financial services to customers through our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, Taylor Morrison Home Funding ( TMHF\u201d), and title services through our wholly owned title services subsidiary, Inspired Title Services, LLC ( Inspired Title\u201d). Our business is organized into multiple homebuilding operating components, and a financial services component, all of which are managed as four reportable segments: East, Central, West and Financial Services, as follows:\n\n2018 Highlights and Recent Developments\nOur financial and operational highlights for the year ended December 31, 2018 and recent developments subsequent to the year end are summarized below:\nFinancial:\n \u2022 In January 2018, we completed our final series of public offerings and repurchases of our Class A common Stock from TPG and Oaktree, resulting in a fully floated public company. \n \u2022 On January 26, 2018 we amended the maturity date of our Revolving Credit Facility from April 2019 to January 2022 allowing incremental financial flexibility. On June 29, 2018, we further amended the Revolving Credit Facility to increase the borrowing capacity to $600.0 million. \n \u2022 We generated $4.2 billion in total revenue and $4.1 billion in home closings revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, increases of 8.8% and 8.3%, respectively, compared to the prior year's total revenue and home closings revenue. \n \u2022 Net income before allocation to non-controlling interest and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $210.5 million and $1.83 compared to $176.7 million and $1.47 for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 Adjusting for the effects of significant and unusual items(1), net income before allocation to non-controlling interest and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $305.5 million and $2.65, respectively. \n \u2022 On October 2, 2018 we completed the Acquisition of AV Homes for total consideration of $534.9 million. \n \u2022 On October 2, 2018, we entered into a 364-Day Credit agreement and borrowed $200.0 million to facilitate the Acquisition. In addition, we assumed AV Homes' senior notes due 2022 in the principal amount of $400.0 million. \n \u2022 On October 26, 2018, we completed a holding company reorganization in order to simplify our capital and tax structure and increase our operational flexibility. \n \u2022 On November 21, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the amount available for repurchases under our stock repurchase program by an additional $100 million and extension of the program authorization until December 31, 2019. As of February 11, 2019, we had repurchased an aggregate of 11.7 million shares of Class A Common Stock in open market purchases which excludes shares repurchased from our Former Principal Equityholders.  Operational\n \u2022 During 2018, our operations were located in nine states with 307 average active communities. \n \u2022 We closed 9.1% more homes during 2018 compared to 2017. \n \u2022 Average sales price of homes closed was $470,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 We ended 2018 with $2.1 billion in sales order backlog. \n \u2022 At December 31, 2018, we owned and controlled approximately 57,000 lots. \n \u2022 For the last four consecutive years, we were awarded America's Most Trusted Home Builder\u00ae by Lifestory Research. \n \u2022 We were recognized and awarded as one of the Best Places to Work by Glassdoor.  (1)Significant and unusual items for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily consist of corporate reorganization costs as described above in addition to acquisition-related costs which include investment banking fees, severance, compensation and\nlegal fees. Significant and unusual items also consists of costs and expenses related to the impacts of purchase accounting from the Acquisition and incremental warranty and impairment charges.\nIndustry Overview and Business Strategy\nWe believe the housing market continues to be driven by certain positive economic and demographic factors, including decreasing unemployment, strong home values, improving household balance sheets, declines in new and existing for-sale home inventory and interest rates which continue to remain low in comparison to historic rates. While we were encouraged by certain positive and improved trends during recent years, several challenges still exist, such as lingering under employment concerns, stagnation in real wages and real or perceived personal wealth, national and global economic uncertainty and uncertainty around the interest rate environment. We are additionally challenged by shortages in the labor supply, specifically as it relates to qualified tradespeople, and volatility in energy prices. Nevertheless, we believe we are in a relatively stable business cycle.\nOur approach in allocating capital and managing our land portfolio has been to acquire assets that have attractive characteristics, including good access to schools, shopping, recreation and transportation facilities. In connection with our overall land inventory management and investment process, our management team reviews these considerations, as well as other financial metrics, in order to decide the highest and best use of our capital.\nWe intend to maintain a consistent approach to land positioning within our regions, markets and communities in the foreseeable future in an effort to concentrate a greater amount of our land inventory in attractive areas. We also intend to continue to combine our land development expertise with our homebuilding operations to increase the flexibility of our business and to optimize our margin performance. From time to time, we may sell land in our communities if we believe it is best for our overall strategy and operations. We do not expect such sales to have a significant effect on our overall results, but they may impact our overall gross margins.\nFactors Affecting Comparability of Results\nThe Management's Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The primary factors that affect the comparability of our results of operations are the impacts of the Acquisition, transaction and corporate reorganization expenses, impairment and warranty charges, and Tax Act.\nOn October 2, 2018 we completed the Acquisition and incurred costs and expenses which primarily consist of investment banking fees, severance, compensation, and legal fees, among other items. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $30.8 million of such unusual costs and expenses in transaction and corporate reorganization expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, our homebuilding gross margin was impacted by purchase accounting. For the year ended December 31, 2018 we recognized a favorable adjustment in fair value for $5.4 million in Cost of home closings on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not incur or recognize transaction and corporate reorganization expenses or adjustments to the fair value of inventory.\nOn October 26, 2018, in connection with our corporate reorganization, all assets remaining in our Canadian subsidiary were contributed to a subsidiary in the United States. As a result, $20.1 million of unrecognized Accumulated other comprehensive loss on foreign currency translation was recognized as a component of Transaction and corporate reorganization expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, we recognized $15.3 million in non-resident Canadian withholding taxes from the Canada Unwind in Income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not incur or recognize corporate reorganization expenses or taxes associated with such reorganization.\nAs of December 31, 2018 we recognized an incremental $39.3 million warranty charge in our Central region. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not incur or recognize such warranty charge. Although we believe we have identified substantially all homes impacted by the repair issue, it is reasonably possible that the estimated liability will change as a result of our evaluation of potential changes in the estimated repair costs and the number of homes impacted.\nDuring 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation was enacted which made comprehensive reforms to the United States tax code, including a decrease to the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, and a mandatory deemed repatriation tax of foreign earnings at a reduced rate, that may be payable over eight years. Our effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2017 includes one-time tax expense charges of $57.4 million to account for the lower tax rate impact to our existing\ndeferred tax assets and $3.6 million for the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian operations in 2015.\nIn addition to the impact of the matters discussed in the Risk Factors listed in Item 1A of this Annual Report, our future results could differ materially from our historical results due to these changes.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), we have provided information in this Annual Report relating to adjusted net income,\u201d adjusted earnings per share,\u201d adjusted income before income taxes,\u201d net homebuilding debt to total capitalization ratio,\u201d and adjusted home closings gross margin.\u201d\nAdjusted net income (basic and diluted) and adjusted earnings per common share (basic and diluted) reflect the net income available to the Company excluding the impact of: significant and unusual transactions, transaction and corporate reorganization expenses, and the tax impact due to such items; the tax reform impact due to the revaluation of deferred assets and liabilities and due to the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings; and resulting adjustments to non-controlling interest. Adjusted income before income taxes reflects our income before income taxes excluding the impact of significant and unusual transactions and transaction and corporate reorganization expenses related to our acquisition of AV Homes and our internal corporate reorganization. Adjusted home closings gross margin is calculated based on GAAP home closings gross margin (which is inclusive of capitalized interest), excluding impairments (if any), warranty charges (if any) and purchase accounting adjustments. We calculate net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio by dividing (i) total debt, less unamortized debt issuance costs and mortgage warehouse borrowings, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, by (ii) total capitalization (the sum of net homebuilding debt and total stockholders' equity).\nManagement uses all of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our operational and economic performance and to set targets for performance-based compensation on a consolidated basis to compare to prior years which did not include such items. We believe that adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted income before income taxes are useful for investors in order to allow them to evaluate our operations without the effects of various items we do not believe are characteristic of our ongoing operations or performance and also because each assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. We believe that adjusted home closings gross margin is useful to investors because it allows investors to evaluate the performance of our homebuilding operations without the varying effects of impairment charges, certain warranty charges, and purchase accounting adjustments. We also use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to capitalization as an indicator of overall leverage and to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry. Because we use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to capitalization to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry, we believe this measure is also relevant and useful to investors for that reason. These measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures as a measure of our operating performance.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, impacting our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the recognition of income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The significant accounting policies that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are critical accounting policies and are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn January 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09\u201d or Topic 606\u201d), which provides new guidance for revenue recognition, and elected to use the modified retrospective approach to account for prior periods. The standard's core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\nHome and land closings revenue\nUnder Topic 606, the following steps are applied to determine the proper home closings revenue and land closings revenue recognition: (1) we identify the contract(s) with our customer; (2) we identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) we determine the transaction price; (4) we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) we recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation. For our home sales transactions, we have one contract, with one performance obligation, with each customer to build and deliver the home purchased (or develop and deliver land). Based on the application of the five steps, the following summarizes the timing and manner of home and land sales revenue:\n \u2022 Revenue from closings of residential real estate is recognized when closings have occurred, the buyer has made the required minimum down payment, obtained necessary financing, the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer, and we have no continuing involvement with the property, which is generally upon the close of escrow. Revenue is reported net of any discounts and incentives. \n \u2022 Revenue from land sales is recognized when a significant down payment is received, title passes and collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have no continuing involvement with the property, which is generally upon the close of escrow. \nAmenity and other revenue\nAs a result of the Acquisition, we own and operate certain amenities, which require us to provide members with access to amenity facilities in exchange for the payment of club dues. We collect club dues and other fees from our members, which are billed on a monthly basis. Revenue from our golf club operations are also included in amenity revenue.\nFinancial services revenue\nMortgage operations and hedging activity related to financial services are not within the scope of Topic 606 and therefore there was no change to our accounting policies related to such activities. Loan origination fees (including title fees, points, and closing costs) are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. All of the loans TMHF originates are sold to third party investors within a short period of time, on a non-recourse basis. Gains and losses from the sale of mortgages are recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 860-20, Sales of Financial Assets. TMHF does not have continuing involvement with the transferred assets, therefore, we derecognize the mortgage loans at time of sale, based on the difference between the selling price and carrying value of the related loans upon sale, recording a gain/loss on sale in the period of sale. Also included in financial services revenue/expenses is the realized and unrealized gains and losses from hedging instruments.\nReal Estate Inventory Valuation and Costing\nInventory consists of raw land, land under development, homes under construction, completed homes, and model homes, all of which are stated at cost. In addition to direct carrying costs, we also capitalize interest, real estate taxes, and related development costs that benefit the entire community, such as field construction supervision and related direct overhead. Home vertical construction costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales at the time of home closing using the specific identification method. Land acquisition, development, interest, real estate taxes and overhead are allocated to homes and units using the relative sales value method. These costs are capitalized to inventory from the point development begins to the point construction is completed. Changes in estimated costs to be incurred in a community are generally allocated to the remaining lots on a prospective basis. For those communities that have been temporarily closed or development has been discontinued, we do not allocate interest or other costs to the community's inventory until activity resumes. Such costs are expensed as incurred.\nThe life cycle of the community generally ranges from two to five years, commencing with the acquisition of unentitled or entitled land, continuing through the land development phase and concluding with the sale, construction and delivery of homes. Actual community lives will vary based on the size of the community, the sales absorption rate and whether we purchased the property as raw land or as finished lots.\nWe capitalize qualifying interest costs to inventory during the development and construction periods. Capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales when the related inventory is delivered or when the related inventory is charged to cost of sales.\nWe assess the recoverability of our land inventory in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment.\u201d We review our real estate inventory for indicators of impairment by community during each reporting period. If indicators of impairment are present for a community, we first perform an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if the carrying value of the assets in that community exceeds the undiscounted cash flows. Generally, if the carrying value of the assets exceeds their estimated undiscounted cash flows, then the assets are deemed to be impaired and are recorded at fair value as of the assessment date. Our determination of fair value is primarily based on a discounted cash flow model which includes projections and estimates relating to sales prices, construction costs, sales pace, and other factors. Changes in these expectations may lead to a change in the outcome of our impairment analysis, and actual results may also differ from our assumptions.\nIn certain cases, we may elect to cease development and/or marketing of an existing community if we believe the economic performance of the community would be maximized by deferring development for a period of time to allow for market conditions to improve. We refer to such communities as long-term strategic assets. The decision may be based on financial and/or operational metrics as determined by us. If we decide to cease development, we will evaluate such project for impairment and then cease future development and marketing activity until such a time when we believe that market conditions have improved and economic performance can be maximized. Our assessment of the carrying value of our long-term strategic assets typically includes subjective estimates of future performance, including the timing of when development will recommence, the type of product to be offered, and the margin to be realized. In the future, some of these inactive communities may be re-opened while others may be sold.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into various specific performance agreements to acquire lots. Real estate not owned under these agreements is reflected in Real estate not owned with a corresponding liability in Liabilities attributable to real estate not owned in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInsurance Costs, Self-Insurance Reserves and Warranty Reserves\nWe have certain deductible amounts under our workers' compensation, automobile and general liability insurance policies, and we record expense and liabilities for the estimated costs of potential claims for construction defects. We also generally require our sub-contractors and design professionals to indemnify us and provide evidence of insurance for liabilities arising from their work, subject to certain limitations. Beneva Indemnity Company ( Beneva\u201d), one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, provides insurance coverage for construction defects discovered up to ten years following the closing of a home, premises operations risk and property coverage. We accrue for the expected costs associated with the deductibles and self-insured amounts under our various insurance policies based on historical claims, estimates for claims incurred but not reported, and potential for recovery of costs from insurance and other sources. The estimates are subject to significant variability due to various factors, such as claim settlement patterns, litigation trends and the length of time in which a construction defect claim might be made after the closing of a home.\nWe offer a limited warranty to cover various defects in workmanship or materials, including structural defects. We may also facilitate a longer warranty in certain markets or to comply with regulatory requirements. Warranty reserves are recorded as each home closes in an amount estimated to be adequate to cover expected future costs of materials and outside labor during warranty periods. Our warranty is not considered a separate deliverable in each sale arrangement, so it is accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies.\u201d In accordance with ASC 450, warranties that are not separately priced are generally accounted for by accruing the estimated costs to fulfill the warranty obligation. Thus, the warranty would not be considered a separate deliverable in the arrangement since it is not priced apart from the home. As a result, we accrue the estimated costs to fulfill the warranty obligation in accordance with ASC 450 at the time a home closes, as a component of cost of home closings.\nOur reserves are based on factors that include an actuarial study for historical and anticipated claims, trends related to similar product types, number of home closings, and geographical areas. We also provide third-party warranty coverage on homes where required by Federal Housing Administration or Veterans Administration lenders. We regularly review the reasonableness and adequacy of our reserves and make adjustments to the balance of the preexisting reserves to reflect changes in trends and historical data as information becomes available. Self-insurance and warranty reserves are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities and Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)\nWe are involved in joint ventures with related and unrelated third parties for homebuilding and development activities. We use the equity method of accounting for entities over which we exercise significant influence but do not have a controlling interest over the operating and financial policies of the investee. For unconsolidated entities in which we function as the managing\nmember, we have evaluated the rights held by our joint venture partners and determined that they have substantive participating rights that preclude the presumption of control. For joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, our share of net earnings or losses is included in equity in income of unconsolidated entities when earned and distributions are credited against its investment in the joint venture when received. These joint ventures are recorded in investments in unconsolidated entities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for indicators of impairment. A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity has occurred which is other-than-temporary. The amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investment's carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Additionally, we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is other-than-temporary. These factors include age of the venture, stage in its life cycle, our intent and ability to recover our investment in the unconsolidated entity, financial condition and long-term prospects of the unconsolidated entity, short-term liquidity needs of the unconsolidated entity, trends in the general economic environment of the land, entitlement status of the land held by the unconsolidated entity, overall projected returns on investment, defaults under contracts with third parties (including bank debt), recoverability of the investment through future cash flows and relationships with the other partners. If the Company believes that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, then no impairment is recorded.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes. Lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal initial capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development. In accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation,\u201d we have concluded that when we enter into an option or purchase agreement to acquire land or lots and pay a non-refundable deposit, a VIE may be created because we are deemed to have provided subordinated financial support that will absorb some or all of an entity's expected losses if they occur. If we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we will consolidate the VIE in our Consolidated Financial Statements and reflect such assets and liabilities as real estate not owned under option agreements within our inventory balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe have issued stock options, performance based restricted stock units and non-performance based restricted stock units, which we account for in accordance with ASC Topic 718-10, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\u201d The fair value for stock options is measured and estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognized evenly over the vesting period of the options. Performance-based restricted stock units are measured using the closing price on the date of grant and expensed using a probability of attainment calculation which determines the likelihood of achieving the performance targets. Non-performance-based restricted stock units are time based awards and measured using the closing price on the date of grant and are expensed over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.\nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of both temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. As a result of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, we have recorded a material charge to earnings in the period ending December 31, 2017. See Note 12 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 740-10, Income Taxes,\u201d we evaluate our deferred tax assets by tax jurisdiction, including the benefit from net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards by tax jurisdiction, to determine if a valuation allowance is required. Companies must assess, using significant judgments, whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not\u201d standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the length of statutory carryforward periods, experience with operating losses and experience of utilizing tax credit carryforwards and tax planning alternatives.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented:\n\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations as adjusted for significant and unusual items, transaction and corporate reorganization expenses, and the impact of tax reform for the periods presented (See - Non-GAAP Measures\u201d above): \n(1)Significant and unusual transactions include the impacts of purchase accounting from the Acquisition, an incremental warranty charge and inventory impairment.\n(2) Transaction and corporate reorganization expenses consist of all costs, excluding taxes, associated with the corporate reorganization and Canada Unwind in addition to Acquisition related costs, which include investment banking fees, severance, compensation and legal fees.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of our net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio (See - Non-GAAP Measures\u201d above):\n\nSee also - Segment Home Closings Gross Margin\u201d for the reconciliation of adjusted home closings gross margin.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nAverage Active Selling Communities\n\nAverage active selling communities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 3.4% when compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily due to the acquisition of AV Homes, resulting in additional communities across all regions.\nNet Sales Orders(1)\n\n(1) Net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers, net of cancellations.\nEast:\nThe average selling price of net sales orders increased by 6.4%, while the number of net homes sold decreased by 7.8% in 2018 as compared to 2017. Product and geographic mix among all divisions within the region contributed to the overall increase in average selling prices. The decrease in net sales orders was due to a lower sales pace for the region in the current year.\nCentral:\nThe number of net homes sold and sales value of homes increased by 12.8% and 15.7%, respectively, in 2018 as compared to 2017. A significant portion of the increase in units and sales value is driven by our Houston market, which was negatively impacted in the prior year as a result of Hurricane Harvey which occurred during the third quarter of 2017. Other markets within this region continue to strengthen their performance and contributed to the overall increase in units and dollars for the segment.\nWest:\nThe average selling price of net sales orders increased by 2.0% while the number of homes sold remained relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Strong demand combined with reduced supply in our Northern California markets drove the overall increase in average selling prices for the region.\nSales Order Cancellations \n(1) Cancellation rate represents the number of canceled sales orders divided by gross sales orders.\nThe total company cancellation rate increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was driven by our West region due to various factors including affordability challenges in our California markets.\nSales Order Backlog\n\n(1) Sales order backlog represents homes under contract for which revenue has not yet been recognized at the end of the period (including homes sold but not yet started). Some of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes, which can result in future cancellations.\nTotal backlog units and total sales value increased by 18.9% and 22.2% at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, respectively. The increase in backlog units and total sales value is primarily due to an increase in net sales orders as a result of our acquisition of AV Homes and obtaining the backlog of homes sold by AV Homes prior to the acquisition.\nHome Closings Revenue\n\nEast:\nThe number of homes closed and home closings revenue, net increased by 16.9% and 19.3%, respectively, for 2018 as compared to 2017. The increases were primarily due to the acquired divisions of AV Homes. In addition, a number of closings were shifted from the prior year into the current year as a result of Hurricane Irma that occurred in late 2017.\nCentral:\nThe number of homes closed and home closings revenue, net increased by 3.6% and 2.2%, respectively, for 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase in units was partially a result of the expansion of our Taylor Morrison brand in our Dallas market, leading to an increase in the number of communities and home closings in the current year compared to the prior year. Our acquisition of AV Homes also contributed to the increase in homes closed in the region.\nWest:\nThe number of homes closed and home closings revenue, net increased by 2.6% and 2.0%, respectively, for 2018 as compared to the 2017. The increases were primarily due to the acquisition of AV Homes, resulting in higher closings in our Phoenix market in the current year than in the prior year.\nLand Closings Revenue\n\nWe generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes. However, in some locations where we act as a developer, we occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned parcels or areas designated for school or government use, which we typically sell to commercial developers or municipalities, as applicable. We also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply on larger tracts of land. Land and lot sales occur at various intervals and varying degrees of profitability. Therefore, the revenue and gross margin from land closings will fluctuate from period to period, depending on market opportunities. Land closings revenue was $39.9 million and $17.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The increase in land closings revenue in the West region was due to the sale of certain long-term strategic assets in the current year.\nAmenity and Other Revenue\n\nAs a result of the Acquisition of AV Homes, our East region includes communities which operate certain amenities such as community and golf clubs. We provide members access to the amenity facilities in exchange for club dues. We do not own or operate significant amenity facilities in our Central or West regions.\nSegment Home Closings Gross Margins\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of adjusted home closings gross margin to GAAP home closings gross margin (see non-GAAP Measures\u201d above).\n\nEast:\nHome closings gross margin percentage decreased to 17.0% from 20.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of product and geographic mix contributing to higher land and development costs in the current year. In addition, we recognized approximately $8.5 million in inventory impairment charges in the current year that negatively impacted our home closings gross margin by 52 basis points in the East region.\nCentral:\nHome closings gross margin percentage decreased to 14.0% from 18.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. The primary driver for the decrease relates to a warranty charge recorded in the fourth quarter. In addition, geographical mix within the region further contributed to the overall decrease for 2018.\nWest:\nHome closings gross margin percentage increased to 19.9% from 16.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. The increase was partially due to product mix contributing to higher average selling prices during the current year. In addition, home closings in the prior year had higher land and development costs due geographic mix resulting in lower margins.\nFinancial Services\nOur Financial Services segment provides mortgage lending through our subsidiary, TMHF, and title services through our subsidiary, Inspired Title. The following is a summary for the periods presented of financial services income before income taxes as well as supplemental data:\n\n\nFinancial services revenue decreased by 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in the current year compared to the prior year was primarily the result of increased financial sector competition impacting pricing and a devaluation of our open pipeline due to rising interest rates, partially offset by an increase in title services revenue driven by the expansion of our title services to North and South Carolina.\nSales, Commissions and Other Marketing Costs\nSales commissions and other marketing costs, as a percentage of home closings revenue, remained flat for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 due to sustained leverage as a result of previous process efficiencies we made in our sales and marketing functions.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home closings revenue, remained flat for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, attributable our efforts to utilize our scalable platform, providing leverage with existing infrastructure to maintain stable operating costs.\nEquity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities\nEquity in income of unconsolidated entities was $13.3 million and $8.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The change was primarily due to an increase in closings in our homebuilding unconsolidated joint ventures as they mature in their life cycle.\nInterest Income, net\nInterest income, net was $1.6 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest income, net includes interest earned on cash balances offset by interest incurred but not capitalized on our long-term debt and other borrowings.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $11.8 million and $2.3 million, respectively. The current year balance included higher pre-acquisition costs on abandoned land projects and higher captive insurance claims than in the prior year.\nTransaction and corporate reorganization expenses\nTransaction and corporate reorganization expenses in the current year was comprised of approximately $30.8 million in Acquisition related costs, which include investment banking fees, severance, compensation and legal fees. In addition, the recognition of approximately $20.1 million of realized foreign currency losses from the Canada Unwind were also included in transaction and corporate reorganization expenses.\nIncome Tax Provision\nOur effective tax rate was 23.0% and 50.3% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was favorably impacted by the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the Tax Act, the relevant provisions of which became effective on January 1, 2018. The 2017 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the Tax Act, primarily due to the revaluation of existing deferred tax assets and the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian business in 2015.\nNet Income\nNet income before allocation to non-controlling interests and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $210.5 million and $1.83, respectively. Net income before allocation to non-controlling interests and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $176.7 million and $1.47, respectively. The increase in net income and diluted earnings per share from the prior year is primarily attributable to higher home closings revenue, net as a result of an increase in the number of homes closed, as well as a decrease in our income tax provision due to a lower effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nAverage Active Selling Communities\n\nAverage active selling communities for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by 3.9% when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily driven by the West region which experienced higher sales orders in the first half of 2017 resulting in an increase in the number of community close outs. The slight decrease in average active communities aligns with our focus for growth to be primarily driven by improving sales volume rather than only increasing average active communities.\nNet Sales Orders\n\n(1) Net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers, net of cancellations.\nEast:\nThe number of net homes sold and sales value of homes increased by 19.3% and 20.2%, respectively, in 2017 as compared to 2016. Product and geographic mix among all divisions within the region contributed to the overall increase in in net homes sold and sales value. Certain divisions experienced an increase in sales price along with an increase in net homes sold, while others maintained their sales price and increased the number of net homes sold.\nCentral:\nThe number of net homes sold and sales value of homes increased by 15.2% and 15.0%, respectively, in 2017 as compared to 2016. A significant portion of the increase in units and sales value is driven by our Houston market which has shown improvements from the past two years' soft economic environment, despite the impacts of Hurricane Harvey which occurred during the third quarter of 2017. Other markets within this region continue to strengthen their performance in 2017 compared to 2016 and contributed to the overall increase in units and dollars for the segment as well.\nWest:\nThe average selling price increased by 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The markets in this region showed continued strength as evidenced by a 24.3% increase in sales pace. In 2017, we increased our focus on turn times and combined with our limited product availability as a result of the increase in the number of community close outs, the number of net homes sold decreased slightly in 2017 compared to 2016. The value of the net sales orders increased by 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year.\nSales Order Cancellations ", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral Overview\nOur principal business is residential homebuilding and the development of lifestyle communities with operations geographically focused in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas.

Operational\n \u2022 During 2018, our operations were located in nine states with 307 average active communities. \n \u2022 We closed 9.1% more homes during 2018 compared to 2017. \n \u2022 Average sales price of homes closed was $470,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 We ended 2018 with $2.1 billion in sales order backlog. \n \u2022 At December 31, 2018, we owned and controlled approximately 57,000 lots. \n \u2022 For the last four consecutive years, we were awarded America's Most Trusted Home Builder\u00ae by Lifestory Research. \n \u2022 We were recognized and awarded as one of the Best Places to Work by Glassdoor.  (1)Significant and unusual items for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily consist of corporate reorganization costs as described above in addition to acquisition-related costs which include investment banking fees, severance, compensation and\nlegal fees. Significant and unusual items also consists of costs and expenses related to the impacts of purchase accounting from the Acquisition and incremental warranty and impairment charges.\nIndustry Overview and Business Strategy\nWe believe the housing market continues to be driven by certain positive economic and demographic factors, including decreasing unemployment, strong home values, improving household balance sheets, declines in new and existing for-sale home inventory and interest rates which continue to remain low in comparison to historic rates. While we were encouraged by certain positive and improved trends during recent years, several challenges still exist, such as lingering under employment concerns, stagnation in real wages and real or perceived personal wealth, national and global economic uncertainty and uncertainty around the interest rate environment. We are additionally challenged by shortages in the labor supply, specifically as it relates to qualified tradespeople, and volatility in energy prices. Nevertheless, we believe we are in a relatively stable business cycle.\nOur approach in allocating capital and managing our land portfolio has been to acquire assets that have attractive characteristics, including good access to schools, shopping, recreation and transportation facilities. In connection with our overall land inventory management and investment process, our management team reviews these considerations, as well as other financial metrics, in order to decide the highest and best use of our capital.\nWe intend to maintain a consistent approach to land positioning within our regions, markets and communities in the foreseeable future in an effort to concentrate a greater amount of our land inventory in attractive areas. We also intend to continue to combine our land development expertise with our homebuilding operations to increase the flexibility of our business and to optimize our margin performance. From time to time, we may sell land in our communities if we believe it is best for our overall strategy and operations. We do not expect such sales to have a significant effect on our overall results, but they may impact our overall gross margins.\nFactors Affecting Comparability of Results\nThe Management's Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The primary factors that affect the comparability of our results of operations are the impacts of the Acquisition, transaction and corporate reorganization expenses, impairment and warranty charges, and Tax Act.\nOn October 2, 2018 we completed the Acquisition and incurred costs and expenses which primarily consist of investment banking fees, severance, compensation, and legal fees, among other items. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $30.8 million of such unusual costs and expenses in transaction and corporate reorganization expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, our homebuilding gross margin was impacted by purchase accounting. For the year ended December 31, 2018 we recognized a favorable adjustment in fair value for $5.4 million in Cost of home closings on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not incur or recognize transaction and corporate reorganization expenses or adjustments to the fair value of inventory.\nOn October 26, 2018, in connection with our corporate reorganization, all assets remaining in our Canadian subsidiary were contributed to a subsidiary in the United States. As a result, $20.1 million of unrecognized Accumulated other comprehensive loss on foreign currency translation was recognized as a component of Transaction and corporate reorganization expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, we recognized $15.3 million in non-resident Canadian withholding taxes from the Canada Unwind in Income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not incur or recognize corporate reorganization expenses or taxes associated with such reorganization.\nAs of December 31, 2018 we recognized an incremental $39.3 million warranty charge in our Central region. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not incur or recognize such warranty charge. Although we believe we have identified substantially all homes impacted by the repair issue, it is reasonably possible that the estimated liability will change as a result of our evaluation of potential changes in the estimated repair costs and the number of homes impacted.\nDuring 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation was enacted which made comprehensive reforms to the United States tax code, including a decrease to the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, and a mandatory deemed repatriation tax of foreign earnings at a reduced rate, that may be payable over eight years. Our effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2017 includes one-time tax expense charges of $57.4 million to account for the lower tax rate impact to our existing\ndeferred tax assets and $3.6 million for the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian operations in 2015.\nIn addition to the impact of the matters discussed in the Risk Factors listed in Item 1A of this Annual Report, our future results could differ materially from our historical results due to these changes.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), we have provided information in this Annual Report relating to adjusted net income,\u201d adjusted earnings per share,\u201d adjusted income before income taxes,\u201d net homebuilding debt to total capitalization ratio,\u201d and adjusted home closings gross margin.\u201d\nAdjusted net income (basic and diluted) and adjusted earnings per common share (basic and diluted) reflect the net income available to the Company excluding the impact of: significant and unusual transactions, transaction and corporate reorganization expenses, and the tax impact due to such items; the tax reform impact due to the revaluation of deferred assets and liabilities and due to the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings; and resulting adjustments to non-controlling interest. Adjusted income before income taxes reflects our income before income taxes excluding the impact of significant and unusual transactions and transaction and corporate reorganization expenses related to our acquisition of AV Homes and our internal corporate reorganization. Adjusted home closings gross margin is calculated based on GAAP home closings gross margin (which is inclusive of capitalized interest), excluding impairments (if any), warranty charges (if any) and purchase accounting adjustments. We calculate net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio by dividing (i) total debt, less unamortized debt issuance costs and mortgage warehouse borrowings, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, by (ii) total capitalization (the sum of net homebuilding debt and total stockholders' equity).\nManagement uses all of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our operational and economic performance and to set targets for performance-based compensation on a consolidated basis to compare to prior years which did not include such items. We believe that adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted income before income taxes are useful for investors in order to allow them to evaluate our operations without the effects of various items we do not believe are characteristic of our ongoing operations or performance and also because each assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. We believe that adjusted home closings gross margin is useful to investors because it allows investors to evaluate the performance of our homebuilding operations without the varying effects of impairment charges, certain warranty charges, and purchase accounting adjustments. We also use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to capitalization as an indicator of overall leverage and to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry. Because we use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to capitalization to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry, we believe this measure is also relevant and useful to investors for that reason. These measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures as a measure of our operating performance.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, impacting our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the recognition of income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The significant accounting policies that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are critical accounting policies and are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn January 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09\u201d or Topic 606\u201d), which provides new guidance for revenue recognition, and elected to use the modified retrospective approach to account for prior periods. The standard's core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\nHome and land closings revenue\nUnder Topic 606, the following steps are applied to determine the proper home closings revenue and land closings revenue recognition: (1) we identify the contract(s) with our customer; (2) we identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) we determine the transaction price; (4) we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) we recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation. For our home sales transactions, we have one contract, with one performance obligation, with each customer to build and deliver the home purchased (or develop and deliver land). Based on the application of the five steps, the following summarizes the timing and manner of home and land sales revenue:\n \u2022 Revenue from closings of residential real estate is recognized when closings have occurred, the buyer has made the required minimum down payment, obtained necessary financing, the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer, and we have no continuing involvement with the property, which is generally upon the close of escrow. Revenue is reported net of any discounts and incentives. \n \u2022 Revenue from land sales is recognized when a significant down payment is received, title passes and collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have no continuing involvement with the property, which is generally upon the close of escrow. \nAmenity and other revenue\nAs a result of the Acquisition, we own and operate certain amenities, which require us to provide members with access to amenity facilities in exchange for the payment of club dues. We collect club dues and other fees from our members, which are billed on a monthly basis. Revenue from our golf club operations are also included in amenity revenue.\nFinancial services revenue\nMortgage operations and hedging activity related to financial services are not within the scope of Topic 606 and therefore there was no change to our accounting policies related to such activities. Loan origination fees (including title fees, points, and closing costs) are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. All of the loans TMHF originates are sold to third party investors within a short period of time, on a non-recourse basis. Gains and losses from the sale of mortgages are recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 860-20, Sales of Financial Assets. TMHF does not have continuing involvement with the transferred assets, therefore, we derecognize the mortgage loans at time of sale, based on the difference between the selling price and carrying value of the related loans upon sale, recording a gain/loss on sale in the period of sale. Also included in financial services revenue/expenses is the realized and unrealized gains and losses from hedging instruments.\nReal Estate Inventory Valuation and Costing\nInventory consists of raw land, land under development, homes under construction, completed homes, and model homes, all of which are stated at cost. In addition to direct carrying costs, we also capitalize interest, real estate taxes, and related development costs that benefit the entire community, such as field construction supervision and related direct overhead. Home vertical construction costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales at the time of home closing using the specific identification method. Land acquisition, development, interest, real estate taxes and overhead are allocated to homes and units using the relative sales value method. These costs are capitalized to inventory from the point development begins to the point construction is completed. Changes in estimated costs to be incurred in a community are generally allocated to the remaining lots on a prospective basis. For those communities that have been temporarily closed or development has been discontinued, we do not allocate interest or other costs to the community's inventory until activity resumes. Such costs are expensed as incurred.\nThe life cycle of the community generally ranges from two to five years, commencing with the acquisition of unentitled or entitled land, continuing through the land development phase and concluding with the sale, construction and delivery of homes. Actual community lives will vary based on the size of the community, the sales absorption rate and whether we purchased the property as raw land or as finished lots.\nWe capitalize qualifying interest costs to inventory during the development and construction periods. Capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales when the related inventory is delivered or when the related inventory is charged to cost of sales.\nWe assess the recoverability of our land inventory in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment.\u201d We review our real estate inventory for indicators of impairment by community during each reporting period. If indicators of impairment are present for a community, we first perform an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if the carrying value of the assets in that community exceeds the undiscounted cash flows. Generally, if the carrying value of the assets exceeds their estimated undiscounted cash flows, then the assets are deemed to be impaired and are recorded at fair value as of the assessment date. Our determination of fair value is primarily based on a discounted cash flow model which includes projections and estimates relating to sales prices, construction costs, sales pace, and other factors. Changes in these expectations may lead to a change in the outcome of our impairment analysis, and actual results may also differ from our assumptions.\nIn certain cases, we may elect to cease development and/or marketing of an existing community if we believe the economic performance of the community would be maximized by deferring development for a period of time to allow for market conditions to improve. We refer to such communities as long-term strategic assets. The decision may be based on financial and/or operational metrics as determined by us. If we decide to cease development, we will evaluate such project for impairment and then cease future development and marketing activity until such a time when we believe that market conditions have improved and economic performance can be maximized. Our assessment of the carrying value of our long-term strategic assets typically includes subjective estimates of future performance, including the timing of when development will recommence, the type of product to be offered, and the margin to be realized. In the future, some of these inactive communities may be re-opened while others may be sold.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into various specific performance agreements to acquire lots. Real estate not owned under these agreements is reflected in Real estate not owned with a corresponding liability in Liabilities attributable to real estate not owned in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInsurance Costs, Self-Insurance Reserves and Warranty Reserves\nWe have certain deductible amounts under our workers' compensation, automobile and general liability insurance policies, and we record expense and liabilities for the estimated costs of potential claims for construction defects. We also generally require our sub-contractors and design professionals to indemnify us and provide evidence of insurance for liabilities arising from their work, subject to certain limitations. Beneva Indemnity Company ( Beneva\u201d), one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, provides insurance coverage for construction defects discovered up to ten years following the closing of a home, premises operations risk and property coverage. We accrue for the expected costs associated with the deductibles and self-insured amounts under our various insurance policies based on historical claims, estimates for claims incurred but not reported, and potential for recovery of costs from insurance and other sources. The estimates are subject to significant variability due to various factors, such as claim settlement patterns, litigation trends and the length of time in which a construction defect claim might be made after the closing of a home.\nWe offer a limited warranty to cover various defects in workmanship or materials, including structural defects. We may also facilitate a longer warranty in certain markets or to comply with regulatory requirements. Warranty reserves are recorded as each home closes in an amount estimated to be adequate to cover expected future costs of materials and outside labor during warranty periods. Our warranty is not considered a separate deliverable in each sale arrangement, so it is accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies.\u201d In accordance with ASC 450, warranties that are not separately priced are generally accounted for by accruing the estimated costs to fulfill the warranty obligation. Thus, the warranty would not be considered a separate deliverable in the arrangement since it is not priced apart from the home. As a result, we accrue the estimated costs to fulfill the warranty obligation in accordance with ASC 450 at the time a home closes, as a component of cost of home closings.\nOur reserves are based on factors that include an actuarial study for historical and anticipated claims, trends related to similar product types, number of home closings, and geographical areas. We also provide third-party warranty coverage on homes where required by Federal Housing Administration or Veterans Administration lenders. We regularly review the reasonableness and adequacy of our reserves and make adjustments to the balance of the preexisting reserves to reflect changes in trends and historical data as information becomes available. Self-insurance and warranty reserves are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities and Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)\nWe are involved in joint ventures with related and unrelated third parties for homebuilding and development activities. We use the equity method of accounting for entities over which we exercise significant influence but do not have a controlling interest over the operating and financial policies of the investee. For unconsolidated entities in which we function as the managing\nmember, we have evaluated the rights held by our joint venture partners and determined that they have substantive participating rights that preclude the presumption of control. For joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, our share of net earnings or losses is included in equity in income of unconsolidated entities when earned and distributions are credited against its investment in the joint venture when received. These joint ventures are recorded in investments in unconsolidated entities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for indicators of impairment. A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity has occurred which is other-than-temporary. The amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investment's carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Additionally, we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is other-than-temporary. These factors include age of the venture, stage in its life cycle, our intent and ability to recover our investment in the unconsolidated entity, financial condition and long-term prospects of the unconsolidated entity, short-term liquidity needs of the unconsolidated entity, trends in the general economic environment of the land, entitlement status of the land held by the unconsolidated entity, overall projected returns on investment, defaults under contracts with third parties (including bank debt), recoverability of the investment through future cash flows and relationships with the other partners. If the Company believes that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, then no impairment is recorded.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes. Lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal initial capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development. In accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation,\u201d we have concluded that when we enter into an option or purchase agreement to acquire land or lots and pay a non-refundable deposit, a VIE may be created because we are deemed to have provided subordinated financial support that will absorb some or all of an entity's expected losses if they occur. If we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we will consolidate the VIE in our Consolidated Financial Statements and reflect such assets and liabilities as real estate not owned under option agreements within our inventory balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe have issued stock options, performance based restricted stock units and non-performance based restricted stock units, which we account for in accordance with ASC Topic 718-10, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\u201d The fair value for stock options is measured and estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognized evenly over the vesting period of the options. Performance-based restricted stock units are measured using the closing price on the date of grant and expensed using a probability of attainment calculation which determines the likelihood of achieving the performance targets. Non-performance-based restricted stock units are time based awards and measured using the closing price on the date of grant and are expensed over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.\nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of both temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. As a result of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, we have recorded a material charge to earnings in the period ending December 31, 2017. See Note 12 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 740-10, Income Taxes,\u201d we evaluate our deferred tax assets by tax jurisdiction, including the benefit from net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards by tax jurisdiction, to determine if a valuation allowance is required. Companies must assess, using significant judgments, whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not\u201d standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the length of statutory carryforward periods, experience with operating losses and experience of utilizing tax credit carryforwards and tax planning alternatives.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands, except per share information)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home closings revenue, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,115,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,799,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,425,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land closings revenue\n</td> <td>39,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial services revenue\n</td> <td>67,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amenity and other revenue\n</td> <td>4,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,227,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,885,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,550,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of home closings\n</td> <td>3,410,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,092,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,801,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of land closings\n</td> <td>33,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial services expenses\n</td> <td>41,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amenity and other expenses\n</td> <td>3,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,489,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,146,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,869,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>738,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>738,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>680,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales, commissions and other marketing costs\n</td> <td>278,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>138,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in income of unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>(13,332\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,846\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,453\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net\n</td> <td>(1,639\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(577\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(184\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>11,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction and corporate reorganization expenses\n</td> <td>50,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>273,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>355,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>314,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>63,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income before allocation to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>206,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to non-controlling interests -

However, in some locations where we act as a developer, we occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned parcels or areas designated for school or government use, which we typically sell to commercial developers or municipalities, as applicable. We also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply on larger tracts of land. Land and lot sales occur at various intervals and varying degrees of profitability. Therefore, the revenue and gross margin from land closings will fluctuate from period to period, depending on market opportunities. Land closings revenue was $39.9 million and $17.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

In addition, the recognition of approximately $20.1 million of realized foreign currency losses from the Canada Unwind were also included in transaction and corporate reorganization expenses.\nIncome Tax Provision\nOur effective tax rate was 23.0% and 50.3% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was favorably impacted by the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the Tax Act, the relevant provisions of which became effective on January 1, 2018. The 2017 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the Tax Act, primarily due to the revaluation of existing deferred tax assets and the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian business in 2015.\nNet Income\nNet income before allocation to non-controlling interests and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $210.5 million and $1.83, respectively. Net income before allocation to non-controlling interests and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $176.7 million and $1.47, respectively. The increase in net income and diluted earnings per share from the prior year is primarily attributable to higher home closings revenue, net as a result of an increase in the number of homes closed, as well as a decrease in our income tax provision due to a lower effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nAverage Active Selling Communities\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East\n</td> <td>130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage active selling communities for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by 3.9% when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily driven by the West region which experienced higher sales orders in the first half of 2017 resulting in an increase in the number of community close outs. The slight decrease in average active communities aligns with our focus for growth to be primarily driven by improving sales volume rather than only increasing average active communities.\nNet Sales Orders\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands )\n</td> <td>Net Homes Sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Selling Price\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East\n</td> <td>3,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,470,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,223,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central\n</td> <td>2,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,124,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>977,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>2,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,335,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,281,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>8,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,929,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,481,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers, net of cancellations.\nEast:\nThe number of net homes sold and sales value of homes increased by 19.3% and 20.2%, respectively, in 2017 as compared to 2016. Product and geographic mix among all divisions within the region contributed to the overall increase in in net homes sold and sales value. Certain divisions experienced an increase in sales price along with an increase in net homes sold, while others maintained their sales price and increased the number of net homes sold.\nCentral:\nThe number of net homes sold and sales value of homes increased by 15.2% and 15.0%, respectively, in 2017 as compared to 2016. A significant portion of the increase in units and sales value is driven by our Houston market which has shown improvements from the past two years' soft economic environment, despite the impacts of Hurricane Harvey which occurred during the third quarter of 2017. Other markets within this region continue to strengthen their performance in 2017 compared to 2016 and contributed to the overall increase in units and dollars for the segment as well.\nWest:\nThe average selling price increased by 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The markets in this region showed continued strength as evidenced by a 24.3% increase in sales pace. In 2017, we increased our focus on turn times and combined with our limited product availability as a result of the increase in the number of community close outs, the number of net homes sold decreased slightly in 2017 compared to 2016. The value of the net sales orders increased by 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year.\nSales Order Cancellations Table 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Cancellation Rate (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Company\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.6\n</td>"}
