Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nRecent Developments\nStrategic Review. On October 30, 2017, the Board initiated a process to explore strategic and financial alternatives. The Board, in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, is carefully reviewing and considering a full range of options focused on maximizing stockholder value. There can be no assurance that the Board's exploration of strategic and financial alternatives will result in any particular action or any transaction being pursued, entered into or consummated, or the timing of any action or transaction.\nExecutive Management Changes. On December 30, 2017, Mark E. Speese resigned from his position as Chief Executive Officer and the Board named Mitchell E. Fadel as Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Fadel served as one of the Company's directors since June 2017 and prior to that served as President of the Company (beginning in July 2000) and Chief Operating Officer (beginning in December 2002) each until August 2015, and also as a director of the Company from December 2000 to November 2013. From 1992 until 2000, Mr. Fadel served as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company's subsidiary Rent-A-Center Franchising International, Inc. f/k/a ColorTyme, Inc.\nCooperation Agreement. On February 5, 2018, we entered into a cooperation agreement with the Engaged Group. The Cooperation Agreement provides, among other things, that we will nominate for election at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders one new independent director to be proposed by the Engaged Group. That individual will replace the nomination of Rishi Garg, a current member of the Board, who has informed us that he does not intend to stand for re-election at the 2018 Annual Meeting. In addition, the Engaged Group has agreed to support the election of J.V. Lentell and Michael J. Gade, members of the Board whose terms will expire at the 2018 Annual Meeting and who have recently informed the Company of their intent to stand for re-election. The Cooperation Agreement also provides that, prior to the 2018 Annual Meeting, the Board will be composed of six directors, but may, following the 2018 Annual Meeting, be expanded to seven directors during the remaining term of the Cooperation Agreement (in which case nominees for the seventh director seat would be proposed by the Engaged Group). The Engaged Group has also agreed to vote all of the shares of Common Stock it beneficially owns in favor of our previously announced proposal to declassify the Board which, if approved, will result in all directors standing for election on an annual basis. We have also agreed to terminate our stockholder rights plan no later than February 28, 2018.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion focuses on our results of operations and issues related to our liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we experienced a decline in revenues, gross profit and operating profit driven primarily by declines in same store revenue, reductions in our store base, and impacts related to the recent hurricanes in the Core U.S. segment.\nRevenues in our Core U.S. segment decreased approximately $234.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in same store revenue of 8.0%, rationalization of our Core U.S. store base in the prior year, and impacts from the recent hurricanes. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased 1.4% due to the decrease in store revenue and pricing actions taken to right size the segment's inventory mix and changes from the new value proposition. Labor and other store expenses decreased approximately $44.4 million and $64.0 million, respectively, but were negatively affected by sales deleverage.\nThe Acceptance Now segment revenues decreased by approximately $19.8 million or 2.4% primarily due to store closures for Conn's and hhgregg, and impacts from the recent hurricanes. Gross profit decreased by 5.3% primarily due to lower gross margins on merchandise sales driven by our continued focus to encourage ownership and reduce returned product. Operating profit declined 54.1% primarily due to other charges related to store closures and sales deleverage. Excluding these other charges, operating profit decreased by 28.6%.\nGross profit for the Mexico segment as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.5%, while operating profit as a percentage of revenue increased by 4.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nCash flow from operations was $110.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. We used our free cash flow to pay down debt by $52.5 million during the year, ending the period with $73.0 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nThe following table is a reference for the discussion

Total store revenue decreased by $258.1 million, or 8.8%, to $2,680.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $2,938.5 million for 2016. This was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $234.3 million in the Core U.S. segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\nSame store revenue is reported on a constant currency basis and generally represents revenue earned in 3,376 locations that were operated by us for 13 months or more, excluding any store that receives a certain level of customer accounts from another store (acquisition or merger). Receiving stores will be eligible for inclusion in the same store sales base in the twenty-fourth full month\nfollowing the account transfer. In addition, due to the severity of the hurricane impacts, we instituted a change to the same store sales store selection criteria to exclude stores in geographically impacted regions for 18 months. Same store revenues decreased by $99.2 million, or 5.4%, to $1,753.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $1,853.1 million in 2016. The decrease in same store revenues was primarily attributable to a decline in the Core U.S. segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\nCost of Rentals and Fees. Cost of rentals and fees consists primarily of depreciation of rental merchandise. Cost of rentals and fees for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased by $39.5 million, or 5.9%, to $625.4 million, as compared to $664.8 million in 2016. This decrease in cost of rentals and fees was primarily attributable to a decrease of $35.7 million in the Core U.S. segment as a result of lower rentals and fees revenue. Cost of rentals and fees expressed as a percentage of rentals and fees revenue increased to 27.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 26.6% in 2016.\nCost of Merchandise Sold. Cost of merchandise sold represents the net book value of rental merchandise at time of sale. Cost of merchandise sold decreased by $1.1 million, or 0.3%, to $322.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $323.7 million in 2016. The gross margin percent of merchandise sales decreased to 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 7.8% in 2016. These decreases were primarily attributable to a decrease of $6.4 million in the Core U.S. segment, partially offset by an increase of $5.3 million in the Acceptance Now segment driven by a focused effort to encourage ownership and reduce returned product.\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased by $216.5 million, or 11.2%, to $1,718.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $1,935.0 million in 2016, due primarily to a decrease of $191.5 million in the Core U.S. segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 63.6% in 2017 compared to 65.3% in 2016.\nStore Labor. Store labor includes all salaries and wages paid to store-level employees and district managers' salaries, together with payroll taxes and benefits. Store labor decreased by $56.6 million, or 7.2%, to $732.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $789.0 million in 2016, primarily attributable to a decrease of $44.4 million and $10.7 million in the Core U.S. and Acceptance Now segments, respectively, primarily as a result of a lower Core U.S. store base and closure of Acceptance Now locations in the first half of 2017. Store labor expressed as a percentage of total store revenue increased to 27.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 26.9% in 2016.\nOther Store Expenses. Other store expenses include occupancy, charge-offs due to customer stolen merchandise, delivery, advertising, selling, insurance, travel and other store-level operating expenses. Other store expenses decreased by $47.4 million, or 6.0%, to $744.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $791.6 million in 2016, primarily attributable to a decrease of $64.0 million in the Core U.S. segment as a result of our rationalization of the Core U.S. store base, partially offset by an increase of $17.6 million in the Acceptance Now segment primarily, partially due to a one-time, non-cash, charge to write-off unreconciled invoices with certain retail partners, in addition to increased customer stolen merchandise. Other store expenses expressed as a percentage of total store revenue increased to 27.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 26.9% in 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses include all corporate overhead expenses related to our headquarters such as salaries, payroll taxes and benefits, stock-based compensation, occupancy, administrative and other operating expenses, as well as salaries and labor costs for our regional directors, divisional vice presidents and executive vice presidents.

Operating loss decreased $3.5 million, or 5.3%, to $63.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $66.6 million in 2016, due to a decrease of $87.2 million in the Core U.S. segment, primarily related to the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2016, partially offset by increases of $57.3 million in the Acceptance Now segment as discussed in the segment performance sections below. Operating loss expressed as a percentage of total revenue was 2.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2.2% for 2016. Excluding the goodwill impairment and other charges operating results as a percentage of revenue would have been (0.1)% and 3.5% in 2017 and 2016, respectively, discussed further in the segment performance sections below.\nIncome Tax Benefit. Income tax benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $116.9 million, as compared to $8.1 million in 2016. The effective tax rate was 106.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 7.1% in 2016. The increase in income tax benefit is primarily due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our deferred tax balances. Excluding impacts from other charges, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the goodwill impairment charge, the effective tax rate was 41.5% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 29.8% in 2016.\nNet Earnings (Loss). Net earnings were $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net loss of $105.2 million in 2016.

Total store revenue decreased by $315.5 million, or 9.7%, to $2,938.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $3,254.0 million for 2015. This was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $302.1 million in the Core U.S. segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\nSame store revenue generally represents revenue earned in 3,469 locations that were operated by us for 13 months or more. Same store revenues decreased by $134.7 million, or 6.2%, to $2,043.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $2,177.7 million in 2015. The decrease in same store revenues was primarily attributable to a decline in the Core U.S. segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below. Same store revenues are reported on a constant currency basis.\nCost of Rentals and Fees. Cost of rentals and fees consists of depreciation of rental merchandise. Cost of rentals and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016, decreased by $63.9 million, or 8.8%, to $664.8 million, as compared to $728.7 million in 2015. This decrease in cost of rentals and fees was primarily attributable to a $64.0 million decrease in the Core U.S. segment primarily as a result of lower rentals and fees revenue. Cost of rentals and fees expressed as a percentage of rentals and fees revenue increased to 26.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 26.2% in 2015.\nCost of Merchandise Sold.

Operating loss decreased $941.3 million, or 93.4%, to $66.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $1,007.9 million in 2015. Operating loss as a percentage of total revenue was 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 30.7% for 2015, primarily due to the goodwill impairment charges and other charges discussed above. Excluding the $171.6 million and $1,190.7 million of goodwill impairment and other charges in 2016 and 2015, respectively, discussed above, operating profit as a percentage of revenue would have been 3.5% and 5.6% in 2016 and 2015, respectively, discussed further in the Core U.S. segment performance section below.\nIncome Tax Benefit. Our effective income tax rate was 7.1% for 2016 as compared to a rate of 9.8% for 2015. The decrease in income tax benefit is primarily due to the lower goodwill impairment charge in 2016 compared to 2015.\nNet Loss. Net loss was $105.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $953.5 million in 2015, a decrease of $848.3 million.\nSegment Performance\nCore U.S. segment.\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017-2016 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016-2015 Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,835,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,069,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,371,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(234,303\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(302,098\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>1,276,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,467,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,644,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(191,467\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(177,161\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit (loss)\n</td> <td>86,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,020\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(959,447\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,550.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>958,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(99.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in same store revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stores in same store revenue calculation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues. Revenue decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by a decrease of $213.5 million in rentals and fees revenue. This decrease is primarily due to the decrease in same store revenue, rationalization of our Core U.S. store base in the prior year, and impacts from the recent hurricanes. The decrease in same store revenue was driven primarily by a lower portfolio balance in 2017.\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to the decrease in store revenue described above and targeted pricing actions implemented to right size the inventory mix and changes from the new value proposition. Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 69.5% in 2017 from 70.9% in 2016.\nOperating Profit (Loss). Operating profit as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 4.7% in 2017 compared to operating loss of (0.1)% for 2016, primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2016. Excluding other charges and the goodwill impairment charge, operating profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to 5.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 8.1% in 2016, primarily due to sales deleverage, offset by a decrease in store labor of $44.4 million and other store expenses of $64.0 million. Declines in store labor and other store expenses were driven primarily by lower store count, lower customer stolen merchandise losses, and lower advertising expenses. Charge-offs in our Core U.S. rent-to-own stores due to\ncustomer stolen merchandise, expressed as a percentage of Core U.S. rent-to-own revenues, were approximately 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 3.7% in 2016. Other merchandise losses include unrepairable and missing merchandise, and loss/damage waiver claims. Charge-offs in our Core U.S. rent-to-own stores due to other merchandise losses, expressed as a percentage of revenues, were approximately 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2.0% in 2016.\nAcceptance Now segment.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017-2016 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016-2015 Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>797,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>817,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>818,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,827\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(511\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>400,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>422,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>420,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22,379\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>48,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57,307\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,046\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in same store revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stores in same store revenue calculation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues. The decrease in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven primarily by store closures for hhgregg and Conn's locations, as well as impacts from the recent hurricanes, partially offset by higher same store revenue.\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due the decrease in revenues described above, in addition to an increase in cost of merchandise sold driven by a focused effort to encourage ownership and reduce product returns. Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues was 50.1% in 2017 as compared to 51.6% in 2016.\nOperating Profit. Operating profit decreased by 54.1% compared to 2016, primarily due to increased rental merchandise losses, charges incurred for store closures, and sales deleverage. Operating profit as a percentage of total segment revenue decreased to 6.1% in 2017 from 13.0% for 2016. Excluding other charges, operating profit as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 9.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 13.0% in 2016, partially due to a one-time, non-cash, charge to write-off unreconciled invoices with certain retail partners, in addition to increased customer stolen merchandise. Charge-offs in our Acceptance Now locations due to customer stolen merchandise, expressed as a percentage of revenues, were approximately 12.7% in 2017 as compared to 10.0% in 2016.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $110.5 million in operating cash flow. We paid down debt by $52.5 million from cash generated from operations and also used cash in the amount of $65.5 million for capital expenditures and $12.8 million for payment of dividends, ending the year with $73.0 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nAnalysis of Cash Flow. Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $243.5 million to $110.5 million in 2017 from $354.1 million in 2016. This was primarily attributable to the receipt in 2016 of income tax refunds of approximately $80.0 million, the decline in net earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, and other net changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nCash used in investing activities increased approximately $4.3 million to $63.3 million in 2017 from $59.0 million in 2016, due primarily to an increase in capital expenditures.\nCash used in financing activities decreased by $189.2 million to $70.5 million in 2017 from $259.7 million in 2016, primarily driven by our net reduction in debt of $52.5 million in 2017, as compared to a net decrease in debt of $233.8 million in 2016, payment of debt issuance costs of $5.3 million related to the Fourth Amendment discussed below, offset by an $12.7 million decrease in dividend payments year over year.\nLiquidity Requirements. Our primary liquidity requirements are for rental merchandise purchases. As we implement our strategic initiatives, the need for additional rental merchandise is expected to remain our primary capital requirement. Other capital requirements include expenditures for property assets and debt service. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations. In the future, to provide any additional funds necessary for the continued operations and expansion of our business, we may incur from time to time additional short-term or long-term bank indebtedness and may issue, in public or private transactions, equity and debt securities. The availability and attractiveness of any outside sources of financing will depend on a number of factors, some of which relate to our financial condition and performance, and some of which are beyond our control, such as prevailing interest rates and general financing and economic conditions. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available, or if available, that it will be on terms we find acceptable.\nShould we require additional funding sources, we maintain revolving credit facilities, including a $12.5 million line of credit at INTRUST Bank, N.A. We utilize our Revolving Facility for the issuance of letters of credit, as well as to manage normal fluctuations in operational cash flow caused by the timing of cash receipts. In that regard, we may from time to time draw funds under the Revolving Facility for general corporate purposes. Amounts are drawn as needed due to the timing of cash flows and are generally paid down as cash is generated by our operating activities. We believe the cash flow generated from operations, together with amounts available under our Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements during the next 12 months. While our operating cash flow has been strong and we expect this strength to continue, our liquidity could be negatively impacted if we do not remain as profitable as we expect. At February 21, 2018, we had $60.3 million in cash on hand, and $109.7 million available under our Revolving Facility at December 31, 2017, net of the $50 million of excess availability we must maintain on the Revolving Facility as a result of being out of compliance with our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant.\nOn June 6, 2017, we amended our Credit Agreement (the Fourth Amendment\u201d), effective as of June 6, 2017, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, the other agents party thereto and the lenders party thereto. Under the Fourth Amendment, we agreed to provide additional collateral protections to secure the obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment also modified the borrowing terms of the revolving loans under the Credit Agreement, which, as amended, establishes that the aggregate outstanding amounts (including after any draw request) not exceed the Borrowing Base. The Borrowing Base is tied to the Company's Eligible Installment Sales Accounts, Inventory and Eligible Rental Contracts, in addition to Reserves and the Term Loan Reserve. We will provide to the Agent information necessary to calculate the Borrowing Base within 30 days of the end of each calendar month, unless the remaining availability of the Revolving Facility is less than 20% of the maximum borrowing capacity of the Revolving Facility or $60 million, in which case the Company must provide weekly information.\nThe Fourth Amendment reduced the capacity of the Revolving Facility from $675 million to $350 million and the aggregate amount of Incremental Term Loans and Incremental Revolving Commitments from $250 million to $100 million. We may request an Incremental Revolving Loan, provided that at the time of such draw, and after giving effect thereto, (i) the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio on a pro forma basis is no less than 1.10:1, (ii) the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit do not exceed the Borrowing Base, and (iii) if the draw occurs during a Minimum Availability Period, the Availability must be more than the Availability Threshold Amount.\nA change in control would result in an event of default under our senior credit facilities which would allow our lenders to accelerate the indebtedness owed to them. In addition, if a change in control occurs, we may be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior unsecured notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest to the date of repurchase. Our senior credit facilities limit our ability to repurchase the senior unsecured notes, including in the event of a change in control. In the event a change in control occurs, we cannot be sure we would have enough funds to immediately pay our accelerated senior credit facilities and senior note obligations or that we would be able to obtain financing to do so on favorable terms, if at all.\nDeferred Taxes. Certain federal tax legislation enacted during the period 2009 to 2014 permitted bonus first-year depreciation deductions ranging from 50% to 100% of the adjusted basis of qualified property placed in service during such years. The depreciation benefits associated with these tax acts are now reversing. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (\"PATH\") extended the 50% bonus depreciation to 2015 and through Septembers 26, 2017, when it was updated by The Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act allows 100% bonus depreciation for certain property placed in service between September 27, 2017 and December 31, 2022, at which point it will begin to phase out. The PATH act and the Tax Act resulted in an estimated benefit of $184 million for us in 2017. We estimate the remaining tax deferral associated with these acts is approximately $140 million at December 31, 2017, of which approximately 77%, or $108 million will reverse in 2018, and the majority of the remainder will reverse between 2019 and 2020.\nTax Act. We expect that the Tax Act will generate cash tax savings to the Company of approximately $200 million over the next 3 years, mainly due to the decrease in the tax rate and the initial acceleration of depreciation. This deferral of tax due to acceleration of depreciation will cause additional cash taxes in the future as the deferral reverses.\nMerchandise Losses.

As discussed in Note I to the consolidated financial statements, the Credit Agreement consists of $225.0 million, seven-year Term Loans, and a $350.0 million, five-year Revolving Facility.\nWe may use $150 million of the Revolving Facility for the issuance of letters of credit, of which $94.0 million had been so utilized as of February 21, 2018. The Term Loans are scheduled to mature on March 19, 2021 and the Revolving Facility has a scheduled maturity of March 19, 2019. The weighted average Eurodollar rate on our outstanding debt was 1.51% at February 21, 2018.\nSenior Notes. See descriptions of the senior notes in Note J to the consolidated financial statements.\nStore Leases. We lease space for substantially all of our Core U.S. and Mexico stores and certain support facilities under operating leases expiring at various times through 2023.

Our revenue mix is moderately seasonal, with the first quarter of each fiscal year generally providing higher merchandise sales than any other quarter during a fiscal year, primarily related to the receipt of federal income tax refunds by our customers. Generally, our customers will more frequently exercise the early purchase option on their existing rental purchase agreements or purchase pre-leased merchandise off the showroom floor during the first quarter of each fiscal year. Furthermore, we tend to experience slower growth in the number of rental purchase agreements in the third quarter of each fiscal year when compared to other quarters throughout the year. We expect these trends to continue in the future.\nCritical Accounting Estimates, Uncertainties or Assessments in Our Financial Statements\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent losses and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In applying accounting principles, we must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the following are areas where the degree of judgment and complexity in determining amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements make the accounting policies critical.\nIf we make changes to our reserves in accordance with the policies described below, our earnings would be impacted. Increases to our reserves would reduce earnings and, similarly, reductions to our reserves would increase our earnings. A pre-tax change of approximately $0.8 million in our estimates would result in a corresponding $0.01 change in our diluted earnings per common share.\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities. We have self-insured retentions with respect to losses under our workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability and health insurance programs. We establish reserves for our liabilities associated with these losses by obtaining forecasts for the ultimate expected losses and estimating amounts needed to pay losses within our self-insured retentions.\nWe continually institute procedures to manage our loss exposure and increases in health care costs associated with our insurance claims through our risk management function, including a transitional duty program for injured workers, ongoing safety and accident prevention training, and various other programs designed to minimize losses and improve our loss experience in our store locations. We make assumptions on our liabilities within our self-insured retentions using actuarial loss forecasts, company-specific development factors, general industry loss development factors, and third-party claim administrator loss estimates which are based on known facts surrounding individual claims. These assumptions incorporate expected increases in health care costs. Periodically, we reevaluate our estimate of liability within our self-insured retentions. At that time, we evaluate the adequacy of our reserves by comparing amounts reserved on our balance sheet for anticipated losses to our updated actuarial loss forecasts and third-party claim administrator loss estimates, and make adjustments to our reserves as needed.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the amount reserved for losses within our self-insured retentions with respect to workers' compensation, general liability and vehicle liability insurance was $118.0 million, as compared to $120.8 million at December 31, 2016. However, if any of the factors that contribute to the overall cost of insurance claims were to change, the actual amount incurred for our self-insurance liabilities could be more or less than the amounts currently reserved.\nIncome Taxes. Our annual tax rate is affected by many factors, including the mix of our earnings, legislation and acquisitions, and is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to differing interpretations between the taxpayer and the taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense, evaluating our tax positions and evaluating uncertainties. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight and assist us in determining recoverability. We recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have recorded a liability, is audited and effectively settled. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when more information becomes available.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2017, we have completed an initial assessment of the tax effects of the Tax Act, and have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances. We remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to impact future tax returns. However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts resulting in adjustments in future periods in 2018. The impact of the Tax Act may differ from our estimate due to changes in the regulations, rulings, guidance, and interpretations issued by the IRS and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") as well as interpretations and assumptions made by the Company. For the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, we recognized a provisional net benefit of $75.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which is included as a component of income tax expense. See Note H to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nValuation of Goodwill. We perform an assessment of goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 1, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Factors which could necessitate an interim impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, a sustained decline in our market capitalization, prolonged negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results.\nWe use a two-step approach to assess goodwill impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then the goodwill is not deemed impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, we perform a second analysis to measure the fair value of all assets and liabilities within the reporting unit, and if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and the implied fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had been acquired and accounted for as a business combination. As an alternative to this annual impairment testing, the Company may perform a qualitative assessment for impairment if it believes it is not more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\nOur reporting units are our reportable operating segments identified in Note S to the consolidated financial statements. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable but inherently uncertain, and actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, future cash flows based on revenue growth rates and operating margins, and future economic and market conditions approximated by a discount rate derived from our weighted average cost of capital. Factors that could affect our ability to achieve the expected growth rates or operating margins include, but are not limited to, the general strength of the economy and other economic conditions that affect consumer preferences and spending and factors that affect the disposable income of our current and potential customers. Factors that could affect our weighted average cost of capital include changes in interest rates and changes in our effective tax rate.\nDuring the period from our 2016 goodwill impairment assessment through the third quarter 2017, we periodically analyzed whether any indicators of impairment had occurred. As part of these periodic analyses, we compared estimated fair value of the company, as determined based on the consolidated stock price, to its net book value. As the estimated fair value of the company was higher than its net book value during each of these periods, no additional testing was deemed necessary.\nWe completed a qualitative assessment for impairment of goodwill as of October 1, 2017, concluding it was not more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting unit's net assets exceeded the reporting unit's fair value.\nAt December 31, 2017, the amount of goodwill allocated to the Core U.S. and Acceptance Now segments was $1.3 million and $55.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2016 the amount of goodwill was $55.3 million, solely attributable to the Acceptance Now segment.\nBased on an assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, we believe our consolidated financial statements fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of our company as of, and for, the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, we do not suggest that other general risk factors, such as those discussed elsewhere in this report as well as changes in our growth objectives or performance of new or acquired locations, could not adversely impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.\nEffect of New Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which clarifies existing accounting literature relating to how and when a company recognizes revenue. Under ASU 2014-09, a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which amends ASU 2014-09 relating to how and when a company recognizes revenue when another party is involved in providing a good or service to a customer. Under Topic 606, a company will recognize revenue on a gross basis when it provides a good or service to a customer (acts as the principal in a transaction), and on a net basis when it arranges for the good or service to be provided to the customer by another party (acts as an agent in a transaction). ASU 2016-08 provides additional guidance for determining whether a company acts as a principal or agent, depending primarily on whether a company controls goods or services before delivery to the customer. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which provides additional guidance related to the identification of performance obligations within the contract, and licensing. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which provides additional guidance related to certain technical areas within ASU 2014-09. In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides additional guidance related to certain technical areas within ASU 2014-09. In September 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Leases (Topic 840), and Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to the Staff Announcement at the July 20, 2017 EITF Meeting and Rescission of Prior SEC Staff Announcements and Observer Comments, which adds, amends, and supersedes SEC paragraphs related to the adoption and transition provisions of ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-02. The adoption of these additional ASU's must be concurrent with the adoption of ASU 2014-09.\nThe majority of our revenue generating activities fall outside of the scope of ASU 2014-09. We have completed our evaluation of the above standard and related ASU's, for revenue generating activities that fall within scope, and believe impacts stemming from adoption include the timing of revenue recognition for initial franchise fees charged to franchisees for new stores, and the presentation of advertising fees charged to franchisees in accordance with our franchise agreement. We currently recognize initial franchise fees when paid by the franchisee, upon the opening of a new location. Under the new standard, the benefits provided by the Company to the franchisee for payment of the initial franchise fee are not considered distinct from the franchise license, but are considered to provide benefit to the franchisee throughout the term of the license. Therefore, upon adoption of the standard, we will recognize initial franchise fees over the term of the franchise agreement. Regarding advertising fees, the Company currently\nrecords advertising fees paid by franchisees net of operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. Under the new standard, advertising fees will be presented on a gross basis, as revenue, in the consolidated statement of operations. We do not believe either of these changes will result in material impacts to the consolidated statement of operations or require significant changes to existing internal processes for recognizing revenue. The Company will adopt the new standard in the first quarter of 2018, in accordance with the standard's required adoption date, using the modified retrospective adoption method.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which replaces existing accounting literature relating to the classification of, and accounting for, leases. Under ASU 2016-02, a company must recognize for all leases (with the exception of leases with terms less than 12 months) a liability representing a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, and a right-of-use asset representing the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged, with certain improvements to align lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-01, Lease (Topic 841): Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842, which amends ASU 2016-02 to add two practical expedients. The changes allow companies to elect a simplified transition approach, and provides lessors with an option related to how lease and other related revenues are presented and disclosed. The adoption of these ASU's will be required for us beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2016-02 must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, applying the new criteria to all leases existing or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the consolidated financial statements. We do not expect to early adopt these standards and are currently in the process of determining what impact the adoption of these ASU's will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which provides guidance on the treatment of cash receipts and cash payments for certain types of cash transactions, to eliminate diversity in practice in the presentation of the cash flow statement. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 will be required for us on a retrospective basis beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We will not early adopt this standard nor do we believe that the adoption of this ASU will materially affect our presentation of cash flows.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the hypothetical purchase price allocation and instead using the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit. The adoption of ASU 2017-04 will be required for us on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We are currently in the process of determining our adoption date and what impact the adoption of this ASU will have on our financial statements.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting, which clarifies which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required if the fair value, vesting conditions or classification (equity or liability) of the new award are different from the original award immediately before the original award is modified. The adoption of ASU 2017-09 will be required for us on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We will not early adopt this standard nor do we believe that the adoption of this ASU will materially affect our financial statements.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which addresses certain stranded income tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The adoption of ASU 2018-02 will be required for us beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We do not intend to exercise the option to reclassify stranded tax effects within accumulated other comprehensive income in each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (or portion thereof) is recorded.\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that we adopt as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe the impact of any other recently issued standards that are not yet effective are either not applicable to us at this time or will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I cannot identify the table you are referring to.\n- I cannot complete

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nRecent Developments\nStrategic Review. On October 30, 2017, the Board initiated a process to explore strategic and financial alternatives. The Board, in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, is carefully reviewing and considering a full range of options focused on maximizing stockholder value. There can be no assurance that the Board's exploration of strategic and financial alternatives will result in any particular action or any transaction being pursued, entered into or consummated, or the timing of any action or transaction.\nExecutive Management Changes. On December 30, 2017, Mark E. Speese resigned from his position as Chief Executive Officer and the Board named Mitchell E. Fadel as Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Fadel served as one of the Company's directors since June 2017 and prior to that served as President of the Company (beginning in July 2000) and Chief Operating Officer (beginning in December 2002) each until August 2015, and also as a director of the Company from December 2000 to November 2013. From 1992 until 2000, Mr. Fadel served as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company's subsidiary Rent-A-Center Franchising International, Inc. f/k/a ColorTyme, Inc.\nCooperation Agreement. On February 5, 2018, we entered into a cooperation agreement with the Engaged Group. The Cooperation Agreement provides, among other things, that we will nominate for election at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders one new independent director to be proposed by the Engaged Group. That individual will replace the nomination of Rishi Garg, a current member of the Board, who has informed us that he does not intend to stand for re-election at the 2018 Annual Meeting. In addition, the Engaged Group has agreed to support the election of J.V. Lentell and Michael J. Gade, members of the Board whose terms will expire at the 2018 Annual Meeting and who have recently informed the Company of their intent to stand for re-election. The Cooperation Agreement also provides that, prior to the 2018 Annual Meeting, the Board will be composed of six directors, but may, following the 2018 Annual Meeting, be expanded to seven directors during the remaining term of the Cooperation Agreement (in which case nominees for the seventh director seat would be proposed by the Engaged Group). The Engaged Group has also agreed to vote all of the shares of Common Stock it beneficially owns in favor of our previously announced proposal to declassify the Board which, if approved, will result in all directors standing for election on an annual basis. We have also agreed to terminate our stockholder rights plan no later than February 28, 2018.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion focuses on our results of operations and issues related to our liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we experienced a decline in revenues, gross profit and operating profit driven primarily by declines in same store revenue, reductions in our store base, and impacts related to the recent hurricanes in the Core U.S. segment.\nRevenues in our Core U.S. segment decreased approximately $234.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in same store revenue of 8.0%, rationalization of our Core U.S. store base in the prior year, and impacts from the recent hurricanes. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased 1.4% due to the decrease in store revenue and pricing actions taken to right size the segment's inventory mix and changes from the new value proposition. Labor and other store expenses decreased approximately $44.4 million and $64.0 million, respectively, but were negatively affected by sales deleverage.\nThe Acceptance Now segment revenues decreased by approximately $19.8 million or 2.4% primarily due to store closures for Conn's and hhgregg, and impacts from the recent hurricanes. Gross profit decreased by 5.3% primarily due to lower gross margins on merchandise sales driven by our continued focus to encourage ownership and reduce returned product. Operating profit declined 54.1% primarily due to other charges related to store closures and sales deleverage. Excluding these other charges, operating profit decreased by 28.6%.\nGross profit for the Mexico segment as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.5%, while operating profit as a percentage of revenue increased by 4.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nCash flow from operations was $110.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. We used our free cash flow to pay down debt by $52.5 million during the year, ending the period with $73.0 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nThe following table is a reference for the discussion that follows.\n\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nStore Revenue. Total store revenue decreased by $258.1 million, or 8.8%, to $2,680.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $2,938.5 million for 2016. This was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $234.3 million in the Core U.S. segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\nSame store revenue is reported on a constant currency basis and generally represents revenue earned in 3,376 locations that were operated by us for 13 months or more, excluding any store that receives a certain level of customer accounts from another store (acquisition or merger). Receiving stores will be eligible for inclusion in the same store sales base in the twenty-fourth full month\nfollowing the account transfer. In addition, due to the severity of the hurricane impacts, we instituted a change to the same store sales store selection criteria to exclude stores in geographically impacted regions for 18 months. Same store revenues decreased by $99.2 million, or 5.4%, to $1,753.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $1,853.1 million in 2016. The decrease in same store revenues was primarily attributable to a decline in the Core U.S. segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\nCost of Rentals and Fees. Cost of rentals and fees consists primarily of depreciation of rental merchandise. Cost of rentals and fees for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased by $39.5 million, or 5.9%, to $625.4 million, as compared to $664.8 million in 2016. This decrease in cost of rentals and fees was primarily attributable to a decrease of $35.7 million in the Core U.S. segment as a result of lower rentals and fees revenue. Cost of rentals and fees expressed as a percentage of rentals and fees revenue increased to 27.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 26.6% in 2016.\nCost of Merchandise Sold. Cost of merchandise sold represents the net book value of rental merchandise at time of sale. Cost of merchandise sold decreased by $1.1 million, or 0.3%, to $322.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $323.7 million in 2016. The gross margin percent of merchandise sales decreased to 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 7.8% in 2016. These decreases were primarily attributable to a decrease of $6.4 million in the Core U.S. segment, partially offset by an increase of $5.3 million in the Acceptance Now segment driven by a focused effort to encourage ownership and reduce returned product.\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased by $216.5 million, or 11.2%, to $1,718.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $1,935.0 million in 2016, due primarily to a decrease of $191.5 million in the Core U.S. segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 63.6% in 2017 compared to 65.3% in 2016.\nStore Labor. Store labor includes all salaries and wages paid to store-level employees and district managers' salaries, together with payroll taxes and benefits. Store labor decreased by $56.6 million, or 7.2%, to $732.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $789.0 million in 2016, primarily attributable to a decrease of $44.4 million and $10.7 million in the Core U.S. and Acceptance Now segments, respectively, primarily as a result of a lower Core U.S. store base and closure of Acceptance Now locations in the first half of 2017. Store labor expressed as a percentage of total store revenue increased to 27.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 26.9% in 2016.\nOther Store Expenses. Other store expenses include occupancy, charge-offs due to customer stolen merchandise, delivery, advertising, selling, insurance, travel and other store-level operating expenses. Other store expenses decreased by $47.4 million, or 6.0%, to $744.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $791.6 million in 2016, primarily attributable to a decrease of $64.0 million in the Core U.S. segment as a result of our rationalization of the Core U.S. store base, partially offset by an increase of $17.6 million in the Acceptance Now segment primarily, partially due to a one-time, non-cash, charge to write-off unreconciled invoices with certain retail partners, in addition to increased customer stolen merchandise. Other store expenses expressed as a percentage of total store revenue increased to 27.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 26.9% in 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses include all corporate overhead expenses related to our headquarters such as salaries, payroll taxes and benefits, stock-based compensation, occupancy, administrative and other operating expenses, as well as salaries and labor costs for our regional directors, divisional vice presidents and executive vice presidents. General and administrative expenses increased by $2.2 million, or 1.3%, to $171.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $168.9 million in 2016, primarily due to project related expenses, insurance expenses, legal and other professional fees. General and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of total revenue increased to 6.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 5.7% in 2016.\nGoodwill Impairment Charge. During 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $151.3 million due to an impairment of the goodwill in the Core U.S. segment. Goodwill impairment charge is discussed further in Note F to the consolidated financial statements.\nOther Charges - Operating Expenses. Other charges increased by $38.9 million, or 191.7%, to $59.2 million in 2017, as compared to $20.3 million in 2016. Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily included charges related to the closure of Acceptance Now locations, write-downs of capitalized software, incremental legal and advisory fees, damage caused by hurricanes, and reductions in our field support center, partially offset by legal settlements. Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily included charges related to the closure of Core U.S. and Mexico stores, and Acceptance Now locations, partially offset by litigation settlements. See Note M to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding these other charges.\nOperating Loss. Operating loss decreased $3.5 million, or 5.3%, to $63.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $66.6 million in 2016, due to a decrease of $87.2 million in the Core U.S. segment, primarily related to the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2016, partially offset by increases of $57.3 million in the Acceptance Now segment as discussed in the segment performance sections below. Operating loss expressed as a percentage of total revenue was 2.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2.2% for 2016. Excluding the goodwill impairment and other charges operating results as a percentage of revenue would have been (0.1)% and 3.5% in 2017 and 2016, respectively, discussed further in the segment performance sections below.\nIncome Tax Benefit. Income tax benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $116.9 million, as compared to $8.1 million in 2016. The effective tax rate was 106.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 7.1% in 2016. The increase in income tax benefit is primarily due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our deferred tax balances. Excluding impacts from other charges, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the goodwill impairment charge, the effective tax rate was 41.5% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 29.8% in 2016.\nNet Earnings (Loss). Net earnings were $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net loss of $105.2 million in 2016. Excluding impacts from other charges, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the goodwill impairment charge, net loss was $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net earnings of $40.9 million in 2016.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nStore Revenue. Total store revenue decreased by $315.5 million, or 9.7%, to $2,938.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $3,254.0 million for 2015. This was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $302.1 million in the Core U.S. segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\nSame store revenue generally represents revenue earned in 3,469 locations that were operated by us for 13 months or more. Same store revenues decreased by $134.7 million, or 6.2%, to $2,043.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $2,177.7 million in 2015. The decrease in same store revenues was primarily attributable to a decline in the Core U.S. segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below. Same store revenues are reported on a constant currency basis.\nCost of Rentals and Fees. Cost of rentals and fees consists of depreciation of rental merchandise. Cost of rentals and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016, decreased by $63.9 million, or 8.8%, to $664.8 million, as compared to $728.7 million in 2015. This decrease in cost of rentals and fees was primarily attributable to a $64.0 million decrease in the Core U.S. segment primarily as a result of lower rentals and fees revenue. Cost of rentals and fees expressed as a percentage of rentals and fees revenue increased to 26.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 26.2% in 2015.\nCost of Merchandise Sold. Cost of merchandise sold represents the net book value of rental merchandise at time of sale. Cost of merchandise sold decreased by $33.0 million, or 9.2%, to $323.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $356.7 million in 2015, primarily attributable to a decrease of $24.8 million in the Core U.S. segment. The gross margin percent of merchandise sales increased to 7.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 5.4% in 2015.\nOther Charges - Cost of Revenues.

Gross profit decreased by $183.1 million, or 8.6%, to $1,935.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $2,118.1 million in 2015, due primarily to a decrease of $177.2 million in the Core U.S. segment. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue increased to 65.3% in 2016 compared to 64.6% in 2015 primarily due to improvements in the Acceptance Now segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below. Excluding other charges, gross profit was $1,935.0 million, or 65.3% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $2,152.8 million, or 65.7% of revenue for 2015. These changes are primarily due to the decrease in the Core U.S. store revenue.\nStore Labor. Store labor includes all salaries and wages paid to store-level employees and district managers' salaries, together with payroll taxes and benefits. Store labor decreased by $65.6 million, or 7.7%, to $789.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $854.6 million in 2015. Labor in the Core U.S. segment decreased $59.5 million due to our flexible labor initiative and the continued rationalization of the Core U.S. store base.

Operating loss as a percentage of total revenue was 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 30.7% for 2015, primarily due to the goodwill impairment charges and other charges discussed above. Excluding the $171.6 million and $1,190.7 million of goodwill impairment and other charges in 2016 and 2015, respectively, discussed above, operating profit as a percentage of revenue would have been 3.5% and 5.6% in 2016 and 2015, respectively, discussed further in the Core U.S. segment performance section below.\nIncome Tax Benefit. Our effective income tax rate was 7.1% for 2016 as compared to a rate of 9.8% for 2015. The decrease in income tax benefit is primarily due to the lower goodwill impairment charge in 2016 compared to 2015.\nNet Loss. Net loss was $105.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $953.5 million in 2015, a decrease of $848.3 million.\nSegment Performance\nCore U.S. segment.\n\nRevenues. Revenue decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by a decrease of $213.5 million in rentals and fees revenue. This decrease is primarily due to the decrease in same store revenue, rationalization of our Core U.S. store base in the prior year, and impacts from the recent hurricanes. The decrease in same store revenue was driven primarily by a lower portfolio balance in 2017.\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to the decrease in store revenue described above and targeted pricing actions implemented to right size the inventory mix and changes from the new value proposition. Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 69.5% in 2017 from 70.9% in 2016.\nOperating Profit (Loss). Operating profit as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 4.7% in 2017 compared to operating loss of (0.1)% for 2016, primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2016. Excluding other charges and the goodwill impairment charge, operating profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to 5.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 8.1% in 2016, primarily due to sales deleverage, offset by a decrease in store labor of $44.4 million and other store expenses of $64.0 million. Declines in store labor and other store expenses were driven primarily by lower store count, lower customer stolen merchandise losses, and lower advertising expenses. Charge-offs in our Core U.S. rent-to-own stores due to\ncustomer stolen merchandise, expressed as a percentage of Core U.S. rent-to-own revenues, were approximately 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 3.7% in 2016. Other merchandise losses include unrepairable and missing merchandise, and loss/damage waiver claims. Charge-offs in our Core U.S. rent-to-own stores due to other merchandise losses, expressed as a percentage of revenues, were approximately 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2.0% in 2016.\nAcceptance Now segment.\n\nRevenues. The decrease in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven primarily by store closures for hhgregg and Conn's locations, as well as impacts from the recent hurricanes, partially offset by higher same store revenue.\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due the decrease in revenues described above, in addition to an increase in cost of merchandise sold driven by a focused effort to encourage ownership and reduce product returns. Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues was 50.1% in 2017 as compared to 51.6% in 2016.\nOperating Profit. Operating profit decreased by 54.1% compared to 2016, primarily due to increased rental merchandise losses, charges incurred for store closures, and sales deleverage. Operating profit as a percentage of total segment revenue decreased to 6.1% in 2017 from 13.0% for 2016. Excluding other charges, operating profit as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 9.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 13.0% in 2016, partially due to a one-time, non-cash, charge to write-off unreconciled invoices with certain retail partners, in addition to increased customer stolen merchandise. Charge-offs in our Acceptance Now locations due to customer stolen merchandise, expressed as a percentage of revenues, were approximately 12.7% in 2017 as compared to 10.0% in 2016. Excluding other charges, charge-offs due to customer stolen merchandise were 10.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Other merchandise losses include unrepairable merchandise and loss/damage waiver claims. Charge-offs in our Acceptance Now locations due to other merchandise losses, expressed as a percentage of revenues, were approximately 1.3% and 0.9% in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nMexico segment.\n\nRevenues. Revenues for 2017 were negatively impacted by approximately $0.8 million due to exchange rate fluctuations as compared to 2016. On a constant currency basis, the decrease in revenue for 2017 was primarily driven by a decrease in same store revenue, compared to 2016.\nGross Profit. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by approximately $0.5 million due to exchange rate fluctuations as compared to 2016. On a constant currency basis, gross profit decreased primarily as a result of decreased rental revenue, partially offset by increased merchandise sales. Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 69.3% in 2017 from 69.8% in 2016.\nOperating Loss. Operating losses were negatively impacted by approximately $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to exchange rate fluctuations compared to 2016. On a constant currency basis, operating loss as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 0.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 4.8% in 2016. Operating losses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included other charges of $0.3 million and $2.3 million, respectively, primarily related to store\nclosures during the first quarter of 2016. Excluding other charges, operating profit as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 0.2% in 2017, compared to a loss of 0.3% in 2016.\nFranchising segment.\n\nRevenues. Revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to lower merchandise sales to the Company's franchise partners.\nGross Profit. Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 44.0% in 2017 from 38.1% in 2016.\nOperating Profit. Operating profit as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 23.0% in 2017 from 22.8% for 2016 primarily due to increased gross profit.\nQuarterly Results\nThe following table contains certain unaudited historical financial information for the quarters indicated:\n\n\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $110.5 million in operating cash flow. We paid down debt by $52.5 million from cash generated from operations and also used cash in the amount of $65.5 million for capital expenditures and $12.8 million for payment of dividends, ending the year with $73.0 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nAnalysis of Cash Flow. Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $243.5 million to $110.5 million in 2017 from $354.1 million in 2016. This was primarily attributable to the receipt in 2016 of income tax refunds of approximately $80.0 million, the decline in net earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, and other net changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nCash used in investing activities increased approximately $4.3 million to $63.3 million in 2017 from $59.0 million in 2016, due primarily to an increase in capital expenditures.\nCash used in financing activities decreased by $189.2 million to $70.5 million in 2017 from $259.7 million in 2016, primarily driven by our net reduction in debt of $52.5 million in 2017, as compared to a net decrease in debt of $233.8 million in 2016, payment of debt issuance costs of $5.3 million related to the Fourth Amendment discussed below, offset by an $12.7 million decrease in dividend payments year over year.\nLiquidity Requirements. Our primary liquidity requirements are for rental merchandise purchases. As we implement our strategic initiatives, the need for additional rental merchandise is expected to remain our primary capital requirement. Other capital requirements include expenditures for property assets and debt service. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations. In the future, to provide any additional funds necessary for the continued operations and expansion of our business, we may incur from time to time additional short-term or long-term bank indebtedness and may issue, in public or private transactions, equity and debt securities. The availability and attractiveness of any outside sources of financing will depend on a number of factors, some of which relate to our financial condition and performance, and some of which are beyond our control, such as prevailing interest rates and general financing and economic conditions. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available, or if available, that it will be on terms we find acceptable.\nShould we require additional funding sources, we maintain revolving credit facilities, including a $12.5 million line of credit at INTRUST Bank, N.A. We utilize our Revolving Facility for the issuance of letters of credit, as well as to manage normal fluctuations in operational cash flow caused by the timing of cash receipts. In that regard, we may from time to time draw funds under the Revolving Facility for general corporate purposes. Amounts are drawn as needed due to the timing of cash flows and are generally paid down as cash is generated by our operating activities. We believe the cash flow generated from operations, together with amounts available under our Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements during the next 12 months. While our operating cash flow has been strong and we expect this strength to continue, our liquidity could be negatively impacted if we do not remain as profitable as we expect. At February 21, 2018, we had $60.3 million in cash on hand, and $109.7 million available under our Revolving Facility at December 31, 2017, net of the $50 million of excess availability we must maintain on the Revolving Facility as a result of being out of compliance with our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant.\nOn June 6, 2017, we amended our Credit Agreement (the Fourth Amendment\u201d), effective as of June 6, 2017, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, the other agents party thereto and the lenders party thereto. Under the Fourth Amendment, we agreed to provide additional collateral protections to secure the obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment also modified the borrowing terms of the revolving loans under the Credit Agreement, which, as amended, establishes that the aggregate outstanding amounts (including after any draw request) not exceed the Borrowing Base. The Borrowing Base is tied to the Company's Eligible Installment Sales Accounts, Inventory and Eligible Rental Contracts, in addition to Reserves and the Term Loan Reserve. We will provide to the Agent information necessary to calculate the Borrowing Base within 30 days of the end of each calendar month, unless the remaining availability of the Revolving Facility is less than 20% of the maximum borrowing capacity of the Revolving Facility or $60 million, in which case the Company must provide weekly information.\nThe Fourth Amendment reduced the capacity of the Revolving Facility from $675 million to $350 million and the aggregate amount of Incremental Term Loans and Incremental Revolving Commitments from $250 million to $100 million. We may request an Incremental Revolving Loan, provided that at the time of such draw, and after giving effect thereto, (i) the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio on a pro forma basis is no less than 1.10:1, (ii) the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit do not exceed the Borrowing Base, and (iii) if the draw occurs during a Minimum Availability Period, the Availability must be more than the Availability Threshold Amount.\nA change in control would result in an event of default under our senior credit facilities which would allow our lenders to accelerate the indebtedness owed to them. In addition, if a change in control occurs, we may be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior unsecured notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest to the date of repurchase. Our senior credit facilities limit our ability to repurchase the senior unsecured notes, including in the event of a change in control. In the event a change in control occurs, we cannot be sure we would have enough funds to immediately pay our accelerated senior credit facilities and senior note obligations or that we would be able to obtain financing to do so on favorable terms, if at all.\nDeferred Taxes. Certain federal tax legislation enacted during the period 2009 to 2014 permitted bonus first-year depreciation deductions ranging from 50% to 100% of the adjusted basis of qualified property placed in service during such years. The depreciation benefits associated with these tax acts are now reversing. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (\"PATH\") extended the 50% bonus depreciation to 2015 and through Septembers 26, 2017, when it was updated by The Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act allows 100% bonus depreciation for certain property placed in service between September 27, 2017 and December 31, 2022, at which point it will begin to phase out. The PATH act and the Tax Act resulted in an estimated benefit of $184 million for us in 2017. We estimate the remaining tax deferral associated with these acts is approximately $140 million at December 31, 2017, of which approximately 77%, or $108 million will reverse in 2018, and the majority of the remainder will reverse between 2019 and 2020.\nTax Act. We expect that the Tax Act will generate cash tax savings to the Company of approximately $200 million over the next 3 years, mainly due to the decrease in the tax rate and the initial acceleration of depreciation. This deferral of tax due to acceleration of depreciation will cause additional cash taxes in the future as the deferral reverses.\nMerchandise Losses. Merchandise losses consist of the following:\n\n (1) Other merchandise losses include unrepairable and missing merchandise, and loss/damage waiver claims.  Capital Expenditures. We make capital expenditures in order to maintain our existing operations as well as for new capital assets in new and acquired stores, and investment in information technology. We spent $65.5 million, $61.1 million and $80.9 million on capital expenditures in the years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAcquisitions and New Location Openings. See Note F to the consolidated financial statements for information about cash used to acquire locations and accounts. The table below summarizes the location activity for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\n\n\n\nSenior Debt. As discussed in Note I to the consolidated financial statements, the Credit Agreement consists of $225.0 million, seven-year Term Loans, and a $350.0 million, five-year Revolving Facility.\nWe may use $150 million of the Revolving Facility for the issuance of letters of credit, of which $94.0 million had been so utilized as of February 21, 2018. The Term Loans are scheduled to mature on March 19, 2021 and the Revolving Facility has a scheduled maturity of March 19, 2019. The weighted average Eurodollar rate on our outstanding debt was 1.51% at February 21, 2018.\nSenior Notes. See descriptions of the senior notes in Note J to the consolidated financial statements.\nStore Leases. We lease space for substantially all of our Core U.S. and Mexico stores and certain support facilities under operating leases expiring at various times through 2023. Most of our store leases are five year leases and contain renewal options for additional periods ranging from three to five years at rental rates adjusted according to agreed-upon formulas.\nContractual Cash Commitments. The table below summarizes debt, lease and other minimum cash obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2017:\n\n (1) Does not include interest payments. Our senior term debt bears interest at varying rates equal to the Eurodollar rate (not less than 0.75%) plus 3.00% or the prime rate plus 2.00% at our election. The Eurodollar rate on our senior term debt at December 31, 2017 was 1.57%. \n (2) Does not include interest payments. Our Revolving Facility bears interest at varying rates equal to the Eurodollar rate plus 1.50% to 3.00% or the prime rate plus 0.50% to 2.00% at our election. The weighted average Eurodollar rate on our Revolving Facility at December 31, 2017 was 1.48%. \n (3) Includes interest payments of $9.7 million on each May 15 and November 15 of each year. \n (4) Includes interest payments of $5.9 million on each May 1 and November 1 of each year. \n (5) As of December 31, 2017, we have recorded $37.3 million in uncertain tax positions. Because of the uncertainty of the amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments, uncertain tax positions are not reflected in the contractual obligations table. \nSeasonality. Our revenue mix is moderately seasonal, with the first quarter of each fiscal year generally providing higher merchandise sales than any other quarter during a fiscal year, primarily related to the receipt of federal income tax refunds by our customers. Generally, our customers will more frequently exercise the early purchase option on their existing rental purchase agreements or purchase pre-leased merchandise off the showroom floor during the first quarter of each fiscal year. Furthermore, we tend to experience slower growth in the number of rental purchase agreements in the third quarter of each fiscal year when compared to other quarters throughout the year. We expect these trends to continue in the future.\nCritical Accounting Estimates, Uncertainties or Assessments in Our Financial Statements\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent losses and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In applying accounting principles, we must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the following are areas where the degree of judgment and complexity in determining amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements make the accounting policies critical.\nIf we make changes to our reserves in accordance with the policies described below, our earnings would be impacted. Increases to our reserves would reduce earnings and, similarly, reductions to our reserves would increase our earnings. A pre-tax change of approximately $0.8 million in our estimates would result in a corresponding $0.01 change in our diluted earnings per common share.\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities. We have self-insured retentions with respect to losses under our workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability and health insurance programs. We establish reserves for our liabilities associated with these losses by obtaining forecasts for the ultimate expected losses and estimating amounts needed to pay losses within our self-insured retentions.\nWe continually institute procedures to manage our loss exposure and increases in health care costs associated with our insurance claims through our risk management function, including a transitional duty program for injured workers, ongoing safety and accident prevention training, and various other programs designed to minimize losses and improve our loss experience in our store locations. We make assumptions on our liabilities within our self-insured retentions using actuarial loss forecasts, company-specific development factors, general industry loss development factors, and third-party claim administrator loss estimates which are based on known facts surrounding individual claims. These assumptions incorporate expected increases in health care costs. Periodically, we reevaluate our estimate of liability within our self-insured retentions. At that time, we evaluate the adequacy of our reserves by comparing amounts reserved on our balance sheet for anticipated losses to our updated actuarial loss forecasts and third-party claim administrator loss estimates, and make adjustments to our reserves as needed.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the amount reserved for losses within our self-insured retentions with respect to workers' compensation, general liability and vehicle liability insurance was $118.0 million, as compared to $120.8 million at December 31, 2016. However, if any of the factors that contribute to the overall cost of insurance claims were to change, the actual amount incurred for our self-insurance liabilities could be more or less than the amounts currently reserved.\nIncome Taxes. Our annual tax rate is affected by many factors, including the mix of our earnings, legislation and acquisitions, and is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to differing interpretations between the taxpayer and the taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense, evaluating our tax positions and evaluating uncertainties. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight and assist us in determining recoverability. We recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have recorded a liability, is audited and effectively settled. We review our tax positions quarterly", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nRecent Developments\nStrategic Review. On October 30, 2017, the Board initiated a process to explore strategic and financial alternatives. The Board, in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, is carefully reviewing and considering a full range of options focused on maximizing stockholder value. There can be no assurance that the Board's exploration of strategic and financial alternatives will result in any particular action or any transaction being pursued, entered into or consummated, or the timing of any action or transaction.\nExecutive Management Changes. On December 30, 2017, Mark E. Speese resigned from his position as Chief Executive Officer and the Board named Mitchell E. Fadel as Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Fadel served as one of the Company's directors since June 2017 and prior to that served as President of the Company (beginning in July 2000) and Chief Operating Officer (beginning in December 2002) each until August 2015, and also as a director of the Company from December 2000 to November 2013. From 1992 until 2000, Mr. Fadel served as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company's subsidiary Rent-A-Center Franchising International, Inc. f/k/a ColorTyme, Inc.\nCooperation Agreement. On February 5, 2018, we entered into a cooperation agreement with the Engaged Group. The Cooperation Agreement provides, among other things, that we will nominate for election at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders one new independent director to be proposed by the Engaged Group. That individual will replace the nomination of Rishi Garg, a current member of the Board, who has informed us that he does not intend to stand for re-election at the 2018 Annual Meeting. In addition, the Engaged Group has agreed to support the election of J.V. Lentell and Michael J. Gade, members of the Board whose terms will expire at the 2018 Annual Meeting and who have recently informed the Company of their intent to stand for re-election. The Cooperation Agreement also provides that, prior to the 2018 Annual Meeting, the Board will be composed of six directors, but may, following the 2018 Annual Meeting, be expanded to seven directors during the remaining term of the Cooperation Agreement (in which case nominees for the seventh director seat would be proposed by the Engaged Group). The Engaged Group has also agreed to vote all of the shares of Common Stock it beneficially owns in favor of our previously announced proposal to declassify the Board which, if approved, will result in all directors standing for election on an annual basis. We have also agreed to terminate our stockholder rights plan no later than February 28, 2018.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion focuses on our results of operations and issues related to our liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we experienced a decline in revenues, gross profit and operating profit driven primarily by declines in same store revenue, reductions in our store base, and impacts related to the recent hurricanes in the Core U.S. segment.\nRevenues in our Core U.S. segment decreased approximately $234.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in same store revenue of 8.0%, rationalization of our Core U.S. store base in the prior year, and impacts from the recent hurricanes. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased 1.4% due to the decrease in store revenue and pricing actions taken to right size the segment's inventory mix and changes from the new value proposition. Labor and other store expenses decreased approximately $44.4 million and $64.0 million, respectively, but were negatively affected by sales deleverage.\nThe Acceptance Now segment revenues decreased by approximately $19.8 million or 2.4% primarily due to store closures for Conn's and hhgregg, and impacts from the recent hurricanes. Gross profit decreased by 5.3% primarily due to lower gross margins on merchandise sales driven by our continued focus to encourage ownership and reduce returned product. Operating profit declined 54.1% primarily due to other charges related to store closures and sales deleverage. Excluding these other charges, operating profit decreased by 28.6%.\nGross profit for the Mexico segment as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.5%, while operating profit as a percentage of revenue increased by 4.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nCash flow from operations was $110.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. We used our free cash flow to pay down debt by $52.5 million during the year, ending the period with $73.0 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nThe following table is a reference for the discussion

Total store revenue decreased by $258.1 million, or 8.8%, to $2,680.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $2,938.5 million for 2016. This was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $234.3 million in the Core U.S. segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\nSame store revenue is reported on a constant currency basis and generally represents revenue earned in 3,376 locations that were operated by us for 13 months or more, excluding any store that receives a certain level of customer accounts from another store (acquisition or merger). Receiving stores will be eligible for inclusion in the same store sales base in the twenty-fourth full month\nfollowing the account transfer. In addition, due to the severity of the hurricane impacts, we instituted a change to the same store sales store selection criteria to exclude stores in geographically impacted regions for 18 months. Same store revenues decreased by $99.2 million, or 5.4%, to $1,753.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $1,853.1 million in 2016.

Store labor expressed as a percentage of total store revenue increased to 27.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 26.9% in 2016.\nOther Store Expenses. Other store expenses include occupancy, charge-offs due to customer stolen merchandise, delivery, advertising, selling, insurance, travel and other store-level operating expenses. Other store expenses decreased by $47.4 million, or 6.0%, to $744.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $791.6 million in 2016, primarily attributable to a decrease of $64.0 million in the Core U.S. segment as a result of our rationalization of the Core U.S. store base, partially offset by an increase of $17.6 million in the Acceptance Now segment primarily, partially due to a one-time, non-cash, charge to write-off unreconciled invoices with certain retail partners, in addition to increased customer stolen merchandise.

Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily included charges related to the closure of Core U.S. and Mexico stores, and Acceptance Now locations, partially offset by litigation settlements. See Note M to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding these other charges.\nOperating Loss. Operating loss decreased $3.5 million, or 5.3%, to $63.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $66.6 million in 2016, due to a decrease of $87.2 million in the Core U.S. segment, primarily related to the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2016, partially offset by increases of $57.3 million in the Acceptance Now segment as discussed in the segment performance sections below. Operating loss expressed as a percentage of total revenue was 2.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2.2% for 2016.

Other charges relating to store sales and consolidations, startup costs related to our new sourcing and distribution network and corporate restructuring decreased by $0.4 million, or 1.7%, to $20.3 million in 2016, as compared to $20.7 million in 2015. Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 included charges for the closure of Core U.S., Acceptance Now, and Mexico locations, partially offset by a litigation claims settlement. See Note M to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding these other charges.\nOperating Loss. Operating loss decreased $941.3 million, or 93.4%, to $66.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $1,007.9 million in 2015. Operating loss as a percentage of total revenue was 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 30.7% for 2015, primarily due to the goodwill impairment charges and other charges discussed above. Excluding the $171.6 million and $1,190.7 million of goodwill impairment and other charges in 2016 and 2015, respectively, discussed above, operating profit as a percentage of revenue would have been 3.5% and 5.6% in 2016 and 2015, respectively, discussed further in the Core U.S. segment performance section below.\nIncome Tax Benefit. Our effective income tax rate was 7.1% for 2016 as compared to a rate of 9.8% for 2015. The decrease in income tax benefit is primarily due to the lower goodwill impairment charge in 2016 compared to 2015.\nNet Loss. Net loss was $105.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $953.5 million in 2015, a decrease of $848.3 million.\nSegment Performance\nCore U.S. segment.\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017-2016 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016-2015 Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,835,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,069,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,371,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(234,303\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(302,098\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>1,276,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,467,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,644,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(191,467\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(177,161\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit (loss)\n</td> <td>86,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,020\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(959,447\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,550.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>958,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(99.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in same store revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stores in same store revenue calculation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues. Revenue decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by a decrease of $213.5 million in rentals and fees revenue. This decrease is primarily due to the decrease in same store revenue, rationalization of our Core U.S. store base in the prior year, and impacts from the recent hurricanes. The decrease in same store revenue was driven primarily by a lower portfolio balance in 2017.\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to the decrease in store revenue described above and targeted pricing actions implemented to right size the inventory mix and changes from the new value proposition. Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 69.5% in 2017 from 70.9% in 2016.\nOperating Profit (Loss). Operating profit as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 4.7% in 2017 compared to operating loss of (0.1)% for 2016, primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2016. Excluding other charges and the goodwill impairment charge, operating profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to 5.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 8.1% in 2016, primarily due to sales deleverage, offset by a decrease in store labor of $44.4 million and other store expenses of $64.0 million. Declines in store labor and other store expenses were driven primarily by lower store count, lower customer stolen merchandise losses, and lower advertising expenses. Charge-offs in our Core U.S. rent-to-own stores due to\ncustomer stolen merchandise, expressed as a percentage of Core U.S. rent-to-own revenues, were approximately 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 3.7% in 2016. Other merchandise losses include unrepairable and missing merchandise, and loss/damage waiver claims. Charge-offs in our Core U.S. rent-to-own stores due to other merchandise losses, expressed as a percentage of revenues, were approximately 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2.0% in 2016.\nAcceptance Now segment.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017-2016 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016-2015 Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>797,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>817,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>818,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,827\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(511\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>400,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>422,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>420,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22,379\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>48,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57,307\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,046\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in same store revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stores in same store revenue calculation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues. The decrease in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven primarily by store closures for hhgregg and Conn's locations, as well as impacts from the recent hurricanes, partially offset by higher same store revenue.\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due the decrease in revenues described above, in addition to an increase in cost of merchandise sold driven by a focused effort to encourage ownership and reduce product returns. Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues was 50.1% in 2017 as compared to 51.6% in 2016.\nOperating Profit. Operating profit decreased by 54.1% compared to 2016, primarily due to increased rental merchandise losses, charges incurred for store closures, and sales deleverage. Operating profit as a percentage of total segment revenue decreased to 6.1% in 2017 from 13.0% for 2016. Excluding other charges, operating profit as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 9.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 13.0% in 2016, partially due to a one-time, non-cash, charge to write-off unreconciled invoices with certain retail partners, in addition to increased customer stolen merchandise. Charge-offs in our Acceptance Now locations due to customer stolen merchandise, expressed as a percentage of revenues, were approximately 12.7% in 2017 as compared to 10.0% in 2016.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $110.5 million in operating cash flow. We paid down debt by $52.5 million from cash generated from operations and also used cash in the amount of $65.5 million for capital expenditures and $12.8 million for payment of dividends, ending the year with $73.0 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nAnalysis of Cash Flow. Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $243.5 million to $110.5 million in 2017 from $354.1 million in 2016. This was primarily attributable to the receipt in 2016 of income tax refunds of approximately $80.0 million, the decline in net earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, and other net changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nCash used in investing activities increased approximately $4.3 million to $63.3 million in 2017 from $59.0 million in 2016, due primarily to an increase in capital expenditures.\nCash used in financing activities decreased by $189.2 million to $70.5 million in 2017 from $259.7 million in 2016, primarily driven by our net reduction in debt of $52.5 million in 2017, as compared to a net decrease in debt of $233.8 million in 2016, payment of debt issuance costs of $5.3 million related to the Fourth Amendment discussed below, offset by an $12.7 million decrease in dividend payments year over year.\nLiquidity Requirements. Our primary liquidity requirements are for rental merchandise purchases. As we implement our strategic initiatives, the need for additional rental merchandise is expected to remain our primary capital requirement. Other capital requirements include expenditures for property assets and debt service. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations. In the future, to provide any additional funds necessary for the continued operations and expansion of our business, we may incur from time to time additional short-term or long-term bank indebtedness and may issue, in public or private transactions, equity and debt securities. The availability and attractiveness of any outside sources of financing will depend on a number of factors, some of which relate to our financial condition and performance, and some of which are beyond our control, such as prevailing interest rates and general financing and economic conditions. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available, or if available, that it will be on terms we find acceptable.\nShould we require additional funding sources, we maintain revolving credit facilities, including a $12.5 million line of credit at INTRUST Bank, N.A. We utilize our Revolving Facility for the issuance of letters of credit, as well as to manage normal fluctuations in operational cash flow caused by the timing of cash receipts. In that regard, we may from time to time draw funds under the Revolving Facility for general corporate purposes. Amounts are drawn as needed due to the timing of cash flows and are generally paid down as cash is generated by our operating activities. We believe the cash flow generated from operations, together with amounts available under our Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements during the next 12 months. While our operating cash flow has been strong and we expect this strength to continue, our liquidity could be negatively impacted if we do not remain as profitable as we expect. At February 21, 2018, we had $60.3 million in cash on hand, and $109.7 million available under our Revolving Facility at December 31, 2017, net of the $50 million of excess availability we must maintain on the Revolving Facility as a result of being out of compliance with our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant.\nOn June 6, 2017, we amended our Credit Agreement (the Fourth Amendment\u201d), effective as of June 6, 2017, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, the other agents party thereto and the lenders party thereto. Under the Fourth Amendment, we agreed to provide additional collateral protections to secure the obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment also modified the borrowing terms of the revolving loans under the Credit Agreement, which, as amended, establishes that the aggregate outstanding amounts (including after any draw request) not exceed the Borrowing Base. The Borrowing Base is tied to the Company's Eligible Installment Sales Accounts, Inventory and Eligible Rental Contracts, in addition to Reserves and the Term Loan Reserve. We will provide to the Agent information necessary to calculate the Borrowing Base within 30 days of the end of each calendar month, unless the remaining availability of the Revolving Facility is less than 20% of the maximum borrowing capacity of the Revolving Facility or $60 million, in which case the Company must provide weekly information.\nThe Fourth Amendment reduced the capacity of the Revolving Facility from $675 million to $350 million and the aggregate amount of Incremental Term Loans and Incremental Revolving Commitments from $250 million to $100 million. We may request an Incremental Revolving Loan, provided that at the time of such draw, and after giving effect thereto, (i) the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio on a pro forma basis is no less than 1.10:1, (ii) the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit do not exceed the Borrowing Base, and (iii) if the draw occurs during a Minimum Availability Period, the Availability must be more than the Availability Threshold Amount.\nA change in control would result in an event of default under our senior credit facilities which would allow our lenders to accelerate the indebtedness owed to them. In addition, if a change in control occurs, we may be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior unsecured notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest to the date of repurchase. Our senior credit facilities limit our ability to repurchase the senior unsecured notes, including in the event of a change in control. In the event a change in control occurs, we cannot be sure we would have enough funds to immediately pay our accelerated senior credit facilities and senior note obligations or that we would be able to obtain financing to do so on favorable terms, if at all.\nDeferred Taxes. Certain federal tax legislation enacted during the period 2009 to 2014 permitted bonus first-year depreciation deductions ranging from 50% to 100% of the adjusted basis of qualified property placed in service during such years. The depreciation benefits associated with these tax acts are now reversing. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (\"PATH\") extended the 50% bonus depreciation to 2015 and through Septembers 26, 2017, when it was updated by The Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act allows 100% bonus depreciation for certain property placed in service between September 27, 2017 and December 31, 2022, at which point it will begin to phase out. The PATH act and the Tax Act resulted in an estimated benefit of $184 million for us in 2017. We estimate the remaining tax deferral associated with these acts is approximately $140 million at December 31, 2017, of which approximately 77%, or $108 million will reverse in 2018, and the majority of the remainder will reverse between 2019 and 2020.\nTax Act. We expect that the Tax Act will generate cash tax savings to the Company of approximately $200 million over the next 3 years, mainly due to the decrease in the tax rate and the initial acceleration of depreciation. This deferral of tax due to acceleration of depreciation will cause additional cash taxes in the future as the deferral reverses.\nMerchandise Losses.

Our senior term debt bears interest at varying rates equal to the Eurodollar rate (not less than 0.75%) plus 3.00% or the prime rate plus 2.00% at our election. The Eurodollar rate on our senior term debt at December 31, 2017 was 1.57%. \n (2) Does not include interest payments. Our Revolving Facility bears interest at varying rates equal to the Eurodollar rate plus 1.50% to 3.00% or the prime rate plus 0.50% to 2.00% at our election. The weighted average Eurodollar rate on our Revolving Facility at December 31, 2017 was 1.48%. \n (3) Includes interest payments of $9.7 million on each May 15 and November 15 of each year. \n (4) Includes interest payments of $5.9 million on each May 1 and November 1 of each year. \n (5) As of December 31, 2017, we have recorded $37.3 million in uncertain tax positions. Because of the uncertainty of the amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments, uncertain tax positions are not reflected in the contractual obligations table. \nSeasonality. Our revenue mix is moderately seasonal, with the first quarter of each fiscal year generally providing higher merchandise sales than any other quarter during a fiscal year, primarily related to the receipt of federal income tax refunds by our customers. Generally, our customers will more frequently exercise the early purchase option on their existing rental purchase agreements or purchase pre-leased merchandise off the showroom floor during the first quarter of each fiscal year. Furthermore, we tend to experience slower growth in the number of rental purchase agreements in the third quarter of each fiscal year when compared to other quarters throughout the year. We expect these trends to continue in the future.\nCritical Accounting Estimates, Uncertainties or Assessments in Our Financial Statements\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent losses and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In applying accounting principles, we must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the following are areas where the degree of judgment and complexity in determining amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements make the accounting policies critical.\nIf we make changes to our reserves in accordance with the policies described below, our earnings would be impacted. Increases to our reserves would reduce earnings and, similarly, reductions to our reserves would increase our earnings. A pre-tax change of approximately $0.8 million in our estimates would result in a corresponding $0.01 change in our diluted earnings per common share.\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities. We have self-insured retentions with respect to losses under our workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability and health insurance programs. We establish reserves for our liabilities associated with these losses by obtaining forecasts for the ultimate expected losses and estimating amounts needed to pay losses within our self-insured retentions.\nWe continually institute procedures to manage our loss exposure and increases in health care costs associated with our insurance claims through our risk management function, including a transitional duty program for injured workers, ongoing safety and accident prevention training, and various other programs designed to minimize losses and improve our loss experience in our store locations. We make assumptions on our liabilities within our self-insured retentions using actuarial loss forecasts, company-specific development factors, general industry loss development factors, and third-party claim administrator loss estimates which are based on known facts surrounding individual claims. These assumptions incorporate expected increases in health care costs. Periodically, we reevaluate our estimate of liability within our self-insured retentions. At that time, we evaluate the adequacy of our reserves by comparing amounts reserved on our balance sheet for anticipated losses to our updated actuarial loss forecasts and third-party claim administrator loss estimates, and make adjustments to our reserves as needed.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the amount reserved for losses within our self-insured retentions with respect to workers' compensation, general liability and vehicle liability insurance was $118.0 million, as compared to $120.8 million at December 31, 2016. However, if any of the factors that contribute to the overall cost of insurance claims were to change, the actual amount incurred for our self-insurance liabilities could be more or less than the amounts currently reserved.\nIncome Taxes. Our annual tax rate is affected by many factors, including the mix of our earnings, legislation and acquisitions, and is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to differing interpretations between the taxpayer and the taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense, evaluating our tax positions and evaluating uncertainties. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight and assist us in determining recoverability. We recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have recorded a liability, is audited and effectively settled. We review our tax positions quarterly"}
