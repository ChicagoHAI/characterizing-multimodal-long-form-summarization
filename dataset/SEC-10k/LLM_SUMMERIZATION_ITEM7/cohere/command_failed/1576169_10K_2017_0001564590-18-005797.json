Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this report beginning on page 19 for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nBenefitfocus provides a leading cloud-based benefits management platform for consumers, employers, insurance carriers, and brokers. The Benefitfocus Platform simplifies how organizations and individuals shop for, enroll in, manage, and exchange benefits. Our employer and insurance carrier customers rely on our platform to manage, scale and exchange data. Our web-based platform has a user-friendly interface designed to enable the insured consumers to access all of their benefits in one place. Our comprehensive solutions support core benefits plans, including healthcare, dental, life, and disability insurance, and voluntary benefits offerings such as income protection, digital health and financial wellness. As the number of employer benefits plans has increased, with each plan subject to many different business rules and requirements, demand for the Benefitfocus Platform has grown.\nWe serve two separate but related market segments. The employer market which consists of employers offering benefits to their employees. Within this segment, we mainly target large employers with more than 1,000 employees, of which we believe there are over 18,000 in the United States. In our other market segment, we sell our solutions to insurance carriers, enabling us to expand our overall footprint in the benefits marketplace by aggregating many key constituents, including consumers, employers, and brokers. Our business model capitalizes on the close relationship between carriers and their members, and the carriers' ability to serve as lead generators for potential employer customers. Carriers pay for services at a rate reflective of the aggregated nature of their customer base on a per application basis. Carriers can then deploy their applications to employer groups and members. As employers become direct customers through our employer segment, we provide them our platform offering that bundles many software applications into a comprehensive benefits solution through Benefitfocus Marketplace. We believe our presence in both the employer and insurance carrier markets gives us a strong position at the center of the benefits ecosystem.\nWe sell the Benefitfocus Platform on a subscription basis, typically through annual contracts with employer customers and multi-year contracts with our insurance carrier customers, with subscription fees paid monthly, quarterly and annually. The multi-year contracts with our carrier customers are generally only cancellable by the carrier in an instance of our uncured breach, although some of our carrier customers are able to terminate their respective contracts without cause or for convenience. Software services revenue accounted for approximately 85%, 87%, and 87% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAnother component of our revenue is professional services. We derive the majority of our professional services revenue from the implementation of our customers onto our platform, which typically includes discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing, and training. In general, it takes from four to six months to implement a new employer customer's benefits systems and eight to 10 months to implement a new carrier customer's benefits systems. We also provide customer support services and customized media content that supports our customers' effort to educate and communicate with consumers. Professional services revenue accounted for approximately 15%, 13%, and 13% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncreasing our base of large employer customers is an important source of revenue growth for us. We actively pursue new employer customers in the U.S. market, and we have increased the number of large employer customers utilizing our solutions from 141 as of December 31, 2010 to 915 as of December 31, 2017, a 30.6% compound annual growth rate. We believe that our continued innovation and new solutions, such as online benefits marketplaces, also known as private exchanges, account services, enhanced mobile offerings, and more robust data analytics capabilities will help us attract additional large employer customers and increase our revenue from existing customers.\nWe believe that there is a substantial market for our services, and we have been investing in growth over the past six years. In particular, we have continued to invest in technology and services to better serve our larger employer customers, which we believe are an important source of growth for our business. We have also substantially increased our marketing and sales efforts and expect those increased efforts to continue. As we have invested in growth, we have had operating losses in each of the last seven years, and expect our operating losses to continue for at least the next year. Due to the nature of our customer relationships, which have been stable in spite of some customer losses over the past years, and the subscription nature of our financial model, we believe that our current investment in growth should lead to substantially increased revenue, which will allow us to achieve profitability in the relatively near future. Of course, our ability to achieve profitability will continue to be subject to many factors beyond our control.\nKey Financial and Operating Performance Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and project our future performance. These metrics help us develop and refine our growth strategies and make strategic decisions. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating loss, as well as segment revenue and segment gross profit, in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Components of Operating Results\u201d. In addition, we utilize other key metrics as described below.\nNumber of Large Employer and Carrier Customers\nWe believe the number of large employer and carrier customers is a key indicator of our market penetration, growth, and future revenue. We have aggressively invested in and intend to continue to invest in our sales function to grow our customer base. We generally define a customer as an entity with an active software services contract as of the measurement date. The following table sets forth the number of large employer and carrier customers for the periods indicated:\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of customers:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Large employer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carrier\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSoftware Services Revenue Retention Rate\nWe believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand the revenue they generate for us over time is an important component of our growth strategy and reflects the long-term value of our customer relationships. We measure our performance on this basis using a metric we refer to as our software services revenue retention rate. We calculate this metric for a particular period by establishing the group of our customers that had active contracts for a given period. We then calculate our software services revenue retention rate by taking the amount of software services revenue we recognized for this group in the subsequent comparable period (for which we are reporting the rate) and dividing it by the software services revenue we recognized for the group in the prior period.\nFor 2017, 2016 and 2015 our software services revenue retention rate exceeded 95%.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents our earnings before net interest and other expense, taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and costs not core to our business. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Please refer to Selected Consolidated Financial Data-Adjusted EBITDA\u201d in this report for a discussion of the limitations of adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most comparable GAAP measurement, respectively, for 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from software services fees, which consist primarily of monthly subscription fees paid to us by our employer and carrier customers for access to, and usage of, our cloud-based benefits software solutions for a specified contract term. We also derive revenue from professional services fees, which primarily include fees related to the implementation of our customers onto our platform. Our professional services typically include discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing, and training.\nThe following table sets forth a breakdown of our revenue between software services and professional services for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 218,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 201,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 161,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 256,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 233,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 185,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generally recognize software services fees monthly based on the number of employees covered by the relevant benefits plans at contracted rates for a specified period of time, provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, access to our software has been granted to the customer and it is available for their use, the fee for the software services is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.\nWe defer recognition of our professional services fees paid by customers related to implementation services that are determined to not have stand-alone value and are sold with our software services, and recognize them, beginning once the related software services have commenced, ratably over the longer of the contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship, which was 7 years. We periodically evaluate the term over which revenue is recognized for professional services to reflect our experience with customer contract renewals.\nAs of July 1, 2015, we determined that we had established standalone value for the implementation services for the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution in the Employer segment as they are now sold separately from the software services. This was primarily due to the system integrators that have been trained and certified to perform these implementation services, the successful completion of an implementation by a trained system integrator, and the sale of several software subscription arrangements to customers in the Employer segment without the Company's implementation services. Accordingly, revenues related to implementation services for the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution in the Employer segment that are delivered after July 1, 2015 are recognized separately from the revenues earned from the Employer software subscription services. Revenues related to such implementation services are recognized at the time that the professional services have been completed and the related software services have commenced. Prior to July 1, 2015, we did not have standalone value for implementation services related to the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution as we had historically performed these services to support our customers' implementation of this solution. The incremental revenue from recognition of services upon delivery compared to recognition over the customer relationship period of 7 years was $2.3 million in twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nWe generally invoice our employer and carrier customers for software services in advance, in monthly, quarterly or annual installments. We invoice our employer customers for implementation fees at the inception of the arrangement. We generally invoice our carrier customers for implementation fees at various contractually defined times throughout the implementation process. Implementation fees that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue until recognized to revenue as described above.\nWe earn commissions from brokerage services from our voluntary benefit insurance offerings. We recognize revenue when these commissions are earned.\nWe will adopt the new revenue accounting standard on January 1, 2018. The new standard will significantly affect how we recognize revenue for our products and services. The expected effects of the new accounting standard are included in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverhead Allocation\nExpenses associated with our facilities, security, information technology, and depreciation and amortization, are allocated between cost of revenue and operating expenses based on employee headcount determined by the nature of work performed.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, for employees, whom we refer to as associates, providing services to our customers and supporting our SaaS platform infrastructure. Additional expenses in cost of revenue include co-location facility costs for our data centers, depreciation expense for computer equipment directly associated with generating revenue, infrastructure maintenance costs, professional fees, amortization expenses associated with capitalized software development costs, allocated overhead, and other direct costs.\nWe expense our cost of revenue as we incur the costs. However, the related revenue from fees we receive for our implementation services, performed before a customer is operating on our platform, that is determined to not have stand-alone value is deferred until the commencement of the monthly subscription and recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the related contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship. For those implementation services that have standalone value, the related revenue is recognized as revenue upon completion of service. Therefore, the cost incurred in providing these services is expensed in periods prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Our cost associated with providing implementation services has been significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost associated with providing our monthly subscription services due to the labor associated with implementation.\nWe plan to continue to expand our capacity to support our growth, which will result in higher cost of revenue in absolute dollars. However, we expect cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue to decline and gross margins to increase primarily from the growth of the percentage of our revenue from large employers and the realization of economies of scale driven by retention of our customer base.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Salaries and personnel-related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories. We expect to continue to hire new associates in these areas in order to support our anticipated revenue growth; however, we expect to decrease our operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, as we achieve economies of scale.\nSales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and commissions for our sales and marketing associates. We record expense for commissions at the time of contract signing. Additional expenses include advertising, lead generation, promotional event programs, corporate\ncommunications, travel, and allocated overhead. For instance, our most significant promotional event is our annual user and partner conference, One Place, which we have held annually. We expect our sales and marketing expense to increase, in absolute dollars, in the foreseeable future as we further increase the number of our sales and marketing professionals and expand our marketing activities in order to continue to grow our business.\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for our research and development associates. Additional expenses include costs related to the development, quality assurance, and testing of new technology, and enhancement of our existing platform technology, consulting, travel, and allocated overhead. We believe continuing to invest in research and development efforts is essential to maintaining our competitive position. We expect our research and development expense to decrease, as a percentage of revenue, as we achieve economies of scale.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for administrative, finance and accounting, information systems, legal, and human resource associates. Additional expenses include consulting and professional fees, insurance and other corporate expenses, and travel. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute terms as a result of ongoing public company costs, including those associated with compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations governing public companies, increased costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance, and increased professional services expenses, particularly associated with the implementation of new accounting standards.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income and expense consists primarily of interest income and expense and gain (loss) on disposal of property and equipment. Interest income represents interest received on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest incurred on outstanding borrowings under our financing obligations, capital leases and credit facility.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes. We incurred minimal income tax expense for 2017, 2016, and 2015. Net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were $253.9 million at December 31, 2017. State net operating loss carryforwards were approximately $221.2 million at December 31, 2017. Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2022, if not utilized. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act ( Tax Reform\u201d) was enacted. Among other things, we expect that the primary provision of Tax Reform to affect us will be the reduction to the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Accordingly, we revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the enacted tax rate and adjusted our valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2017, we have completed our accounting for the income tax effects of Tax Reform except for the impact of state tax conformity of each change and further evaluation of executive compensation. We are not able to determine a reasonable estimate for these items and expect to complete our analysis during 2018 as states make known their conformity with federal tax laws and additional transition guidance is provided related to executive compensation.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Statements of Operations Data\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations

In addition, our carrier cost of revenue included $4.5 million and $4.2 million in depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Period-to-Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 69,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,035\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,482\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in sales and marketing expense was attributable to $9.0 million higher salaries and personnel-related costs as we continued to invest in our direct sales channel.

In addition, our carrier cost of revenue included $0.8 million and $0.9 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Period-to-Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,101\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in sales and marketing expense was attributable to lower compensation expenses, including the impact of a significant carrier deal that occurred in the first quarter of 2015 and a large employer deal that occurred in the third quarter of 2015, as well as the departure of the Chief Commercial Officer in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, we experienced efficiencies that reduced travel-related expenses by $0.9 million and experienced a $0.6 million decrease in other operating expenses.\nThe increase in research and development expense in absolute terms was primarily attributable to a $4.5 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, including an increase in stock-based compensation of $2.1 million comprised of $0.5 million for the accrual of separation benefits related to the departure of our former Chief Technology Officer and $1.6 million attributable to equity awards granted to new and existing research and development associates. These increases were offset by a $2.0 million increase of personnel-related cost capitalized as part of software development. Additionally, we experienced a $0.9 million increase in engineering consulting fees for assistance in product development and a $0.9 million increase in technology infrastructure costs.\nThe increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a $5.7 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs comprised of a $4.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and a $1.2 million increase due to additional general and administrative headcount and the accrual of separation benefits related the retirement of our former Chief Financial Officer. The increase in stock-based compensation is partly attributable to the issuance of stock-based awards in lieu of cash compensation to certain senior executives and a $3.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expense due to additional grants. We also experienced a $1.2 million increase in facilities costs, depreciation expense and technology infrastructure costs.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results might differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from software services fees, which consist primarily of monthly subscription fees paid by customers for access to and usage of our cloud-based benefits software solutions for a specified contract term. We also derive revenue from professional services which primarily include fees related to the integration of customers' systems with our platform, which typically includes discovery, configuration, deployment, testing, and training.\nWe recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided, the fees to be paid by the customer are fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We consider delivery of our cloud-based software services has commenced once access to a configured and live instance on our platform has been delivered.\nOur arrangements generally contain multiple elements comprised of software services and professional services. We evaluate each element in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. An element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has standalone value and delivery of the undelivered element is probable and within our control.\nWhen multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separable into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified units of accounting based on their relative selling price. Multiple deliverable arrangements accounting guidance provides a hierarchy to use when determining the relative selling price for each unit of accounting. Vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) of selling price, based on the price at which the item is regularly sold by the vendor on a standalone basis, should be used if it exists. If VSOE of selling price is not available, third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d) of selling price is used to establish the selling price if it exists. VSOE and TPE do not currently exist for any of our deliverables. Accordingly, for arrangements with multiple deliverables that can be separated into different units of accounting, the arrangement fee is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on our best estimate of selling price. The amount of arrangement fee allocated is limited by contingent revenues, if any.\nEffective July 1, 2015, we determined that we had established standalone value for Benefitfocus Marketplace implementation services in the Employer segment as they are now sold separately from the software services. This was primarily due to the system integrators that have been trained and certified to perform these implementation services, the successful completion of an implementation by a trained system integrator, and the sale of several software subscription arrangements to customers in the Employer segment without our implementation services. Accordingly, revenues related to implementation services for the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution in the Employer segment that are delivered after July 1, 2015 are recognized separately from the revenues earned from the Employer software subscription services. Revenues related to such implementation services are recognized at the time that the professional services have been completed and the related software services have commenced. Prior to July 1, 2015, we did not have standalone value for implementation services related to the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution as we had historically performed these services to support customers' implementation of this solution. The incremental revenue from recognition of services upon delivery compared to recognition over the customer relationship period of 7 years was $2.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nCertain of our other professional services, including implementation services related to the Carrier segment, are not sold separately from the software services and there is no alternative use for them. As such, we have determined that those professional services do not have standalone value. Accordingly, software services and professional services are combined and recognized as a single unit of accounting. We generally recognize software services fees monthly based on the number of employees covered by the relevant benefits plans at contracted rates for a specified period of time, once the criteria for revenue recognition described above have been satisfied. We recognize revenue on Benefitfocus Marketplace implementation services in the Employer segment that have standalone value at the time the services have been completed. We defer recognition of revenue for fees from professional services that do not have standalone value and begin recognizing such revenue once the services are delivered and the related software services have commenced, ratably over the longer of the contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship. Costs incurred by us in connection with providing such professional services are charged to expense as incurred and are included in Cost of revenue.\u201d\nWe also earn commissions from brokerage services from our voluntary benefit insurance offerings. We recognize revenue when these commissions are earned.\nWe will adopt the new revenue accounting standard on January 1, 2018. The new standard will significantly affect how we recognize revenue for our products and services. The expected effects of the new accounting standard are included in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts and Returns\nWe state accounts receivable at realizable value, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and estimated returns. We maintain the allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of some customers to make payments as they become due. We base our estimated allowance on our analysis of past due amounts and ongoing credit evaluations. Historically, our actual collection experience has not varied significantly from our estimates, due primarily to our credit and collection policies and the financial strength of our customers.\nThe allowances for returns are accounted for as reductions of revenue and are estimated based on the Company's periodic assessment of historical experience and trends. The Company considers factors such as the time lag since the initiation of revenue recognition, historical reasons for adjustments, new customer volume, complexity of billing arrangements, timing of software availability, and past due customer billings.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have issued two types of stock-based awards under our stock plans: stock options and restricted stock units. Stock-based awards granted to associates, directors, and non-associate third parties are measured at fair value at each grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, ratably over the requisite service period of the option award. Generally, options vest 25% on the one-year anniversary of the grant date with the balance vesting over the following 36 months. We previously granted options that vest 100% on the fifth anniversary of the grant date. Restricted stock unit awards generally vest 25% on each anniversary of the grant date over 4 years.\nIn 2017, 2016 and 2015, we granted performance restricted stock units that vest upon the achievement of certain financial performance targets. Compensation expense for performance restricted stock units, which are accounted for as equity awards, is recognized over the requisite service period when it is probable that the award will vest. Significant judgment is involved in assessing the probability of achieving performance measures.\nWe determined fair value for restricted stock unit awards based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant or, if not a trading day, the trading day following the grant date.\nWe did not grant any stock options in 2017, 2016 or 2015. As of December 31, 2017, all outstanding options are fully vested and expensed.\nOn January 1, 2017, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standard Update ( ASU\u201d) 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\u201d and elected to account for forfeitures as they occur. Prior to that date, we based our estimate of pre-vesting forfeitures, or forfeiture rate, on our analysis of historical behavior by stock award holders. We applied the estimated forfeiture rate to the total estimated fair value of the awards, as derived from the Black-Scholes model, to compute the stock-based compensation expense, net of pre-vesting forfeitures, to be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.\nBased upon the closing stock price of $27.00 on December 29, 2017, the last trading day of 2017, the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2017 was $4.7 million, all of which was related to vested options. The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding restricted stock units as of December 31, 2017 was $52.3 million, of which all were unvested.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, our primary sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents totaling $55.3 million, $32.0 million in accounts receivables, net of allowance, and unused availability under a revolving line of credit of $38.8 million, without taking into account the borrowing base limit. The terms of our revolving line of credit are described in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn April 2017, we amended our revolving line of credit agreement. The amendment altered definitions in the agreement, including Consolidated EBITDA and Liquidity, and changed the Minimum Liquidity and Minimum Consolidated EBITDA requirements. It also included consents by the lenders to certain administrative actions by us, including with respect to intellectual property and certain of our bank accounts. Additionally, the amendment modified the definition of Excluded Assets in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, dated as of February 20, 2015, which was entered into in connection with the revolving line of credit agreement.\nWe are bound by customary affirmative and negative covenants in connection with the revolving line of credit, including financial covenants related to liquidity and EBITDA. In the event of a default, the lenders may declare all obligations immediately due and stop advancing money or extending credit under the line of credit. The line of credit is collateralized by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets, including intellectual property and the equity of our subsidiaries.\nBased on our current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe our future cash flows from operating activities and existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nGoing forward, we may access capital markets to raise additional equity or debt financing for various business reasons, including required debt payments and acquisitions. The timing, term, size, and pricing of any such financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing on favorable terms or at all.\nCash Flows\nOur cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,937\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (22,826\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (31,545\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,279\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50,245\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,518\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nFor 2017, our operating activities used $5.9 million of cash, as $39.8 million for non-cash adjustments were more than offset by our net loss of $25.9 million and $19.8 million of cash used in changes in working capital. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $15.9 million, accrual of interest on financing obligations of $7.5 million, and non-cash stock compensation expense of $16.1 million. The cash used in changes in working capital primarily consisted of a decrease in deferred revenue of $17.1 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses not associated with the purchase of property and equipment of $3.0 million, and a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits of $3.1 million as the result of timing of payments of accrued amounts. Changes in working capital that provided cash totaled $3.6 million and were primarily comprised of decreases of accounts receivable and other non-current assets.\nFor 2016, our operating activities used $22.8 million of cash, as $38.8 million for non-cash adjustments were more than offset by our net loss of $40.0 million and $21.6 million of cash used in\nchanges in working capital. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $13.1 million, accrual of interest on financing obligations of $6.8 million, and non-cash stock compensation expense of $18.1 million. The cash used in changes in working capital primarily consisted of a decrease in deferred revenue of $17.7 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $3.9 million, and a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits of $3.3 million as the result of timing of payments of accrued amounts. Changes in working capital that provided cash totaled $5.2 million and were primarily comprised of an increase of accrued expenses and other non-current liabilities and a decrease in prepaid expenses.\nFor 2015, our operating activities used $31.5 million, as changes in working capital provided $1.3 million cash and adjustments for non-cash items of $29.3 million partially offset a net loss of $62.1 million. The cash provided by changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in accrued compensation and benefits of $3.3 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $3.0 million, and an increase in accounts payable of $3.4 million, offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $7.8 million. The increase in accrued compensation and benefits resulted from an increase in the number of associates. The increases in accrued expenses and accounts payable are the result of timing of the receipt of invoices and the timing of payments. The increase in accounts receivable resulted from a few significant invoices related to new contracts and the normal timing of customer payments.\nInvesting Activities\nFor 2017, investing activity used $6.2 million as purchases of property and equipment of $8.2 million were partially offset by maturity of short-term investments of $2.0 million.\nFor 2016, investing activities provided $25.5 million as proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments of $40.2 million were partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of $12.7 million and investments in marketable securities of $2.0 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $50.2 million for 2015 as net purchases of marketable securities were $35.5 million and cash purchases of property and equipment were $14.7 million.\nFinancing Activities\nFor 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $10.7 million, as cash from the exercise of stock options of $3.7 million and net borrowings under the revolving line of credit of $16.0 million were partially offset by payments on capital lease and financing obligations of $9.0 million. Cash from the exercise of stock options included $1.8 million related to the exercise of options by our Executive Chairman that were set to expire in February 2017.\nFor 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $6.1 million, as the result of cash from the exercise of stock options of $6.9 million and net borrowings under the revolving line of credit of $10.0 million, partially offset by payments on capital lease and financing obligations. Cash from the exercise of stock options included $5.1 million related to the exercise of options by an executive officer that were set to expire in February 2017.\nFor 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $78.8 million, primarily as a result of $74.5 million from the issuance of common stock and a warrant in a private placement to Mercer, and net draws on the revolving line of credit of $12.6 million offset by payments on financing and capital lease obligations of $9.9 million.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents balances, cash generated from operations, and our ability to draw on the revolving line of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our customer growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our services. We might require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. If our available cash and cash equivalents balances are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell equity or convertible debt securities or enter into an additional credit facility. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our\ncommon shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities, these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Additional capital might not be available on reasonable terms, or at all.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our outstanding credit facility, non-cancelable leases for our office space and computer equipment and purchase commitments for our co-location and other support services. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations at December 31, 2017. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these estimates.\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payment due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1\nyear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt--Revolving line of\ncredit (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing obligations, build-to-suit leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing obligations, other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 238,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 81,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 114,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Repayment of the revolving line of credit is due at end of the term in 2020.

The agreement terminates on February 20, 2020. Borrowing capacity under this agreement is subject to a borrowing base limit that is a function of our monthly recurring revenue as adjusted to reflect lost customer revenue during the previous three calendar months. Therefore, credit available under our line of credit may be less than the $95.0 million borrowing limit. Advances under the revolving line of credit agreement bear interest at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal plus a margin based on the Company's liquidity that ranges between 0.75% and 1.25%. The Company is charged an unused line fee under this arrangement at a rate based on its liquidity of 0.300% to 0.375% per year. Any outstanding principal is due at the end of the term. Available credit was $15.7 million as of December 31, 2017.\nIn December 2016, we entered into a cancellable lease agreement to build additional office space on our headquarters campus. In March 2018, our landlord extended certain terms of the agreement. Under this agreement and extension, we may commence construction on or about April 1, 2019 for a target lease commencement date of July 1, 2020. We can terminate the agreement prior to April 1, 2019 subject to reimbursing the lessor for reasonable pre-agreed out-of-pocket expenses. Annual rent obligation for the first year is $4.4 million and increases 2% each subsequent year during the 15-year lease term. We can renew the lease for five, one-year terms. The aggregate minimum lease payments are approximately $75.8 million and are not reflected in the contractual obligations table above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, other than as disclosed in Note 15, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K, such as the use of unconsolidated subsidiaries, structured finance, or special purpose entities. We are not the primary beneficiary of, nor do we have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest entity. Accordingly, we have not consolidated any variable interest entities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\u201d which amends the revenue recognition requirements in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods and services. In addition, the new standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has issued several amendments to the new standard, including clarification on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations.\nWe will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018 using the full retrospective transition method and recast each prior reporting period presented.\nThe more significant impacts of the new standard to our consolidated financial statements are currently expected to be as follows:\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We currently recognize revenue from certain professional services in the Carrier segment over time, which is the customer relationship period. Under the new standard, revenue from certain of these services will be recognized over the contract term of the associated software services contract, including any extension periods representing a material right, or in some cases over the period of delivery of the professional fees, both of which are typically shorter than the customer relationship period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We currently recognize insurance broker commission revenue over the policy period. Under the new standard, the revenue related to broker commissions will be recognized when the orders for the policies are received and transferred to the insurance carrier. As a result, software services revenue from these arrangements in the Employer segment will be recognized earlier under the new standard in comparison to the current guidance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The new standard provides guidance on accounting for certain revenue-related costs, including when to capitalize costs associated with obtaining and fulfilling a contract. The majority of these costs are currently expensed as incurred. Under the new standard, Carrier segment assets recognized for the costs to obtain a contract, which includes sales commissions, will be amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer of the services to which the assets relate, considering anticipated renewals when applicable. Carrier segment assets recognized for costs to fulfill a contract, which include internal costs related to implementing carrier products, will be amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer of the services to which the asset relates, which is generally expected to be five years. Costs to fulfill contracts in the Employer segment will be expensed as incurred.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur historical net cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities will not be impacted by adoption of the new revenue standard.\nIn June 2016, the FASB ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\u201d The purpose of this ASU is to require a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. This ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842)\u201d. The amendments in this update require lessees, among other things, to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous authoritative guidance. This update also introduces new disclosure requirements for leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2019, but early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe are evaluating other accounting standards and exposure drafts that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date to determine whether adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am unable to identify the specific cells in the table you would like to copy.\n- Would you be able to clarify which cells you would like to copy?

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this report beginning on page 19 for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nBenefitfocus provides a leading cloud-based benefits management platform for consumers, employers, insurance carriers, and brokers. The Benefitfocus Platform simplifies how organizations and individuals shop for, enroll in, manage, and exchange benefits. Our employer and insurance carrier customers rely on our platform to manage, scale and exchange data. Our web-based platform has a user-friendly interface designed to enable the insured consumers to access all of their benefits in one place. Our comprehensive solutions support core benefits plans, including healthcare, dental, life, and disability insurance, and voluntary benefits offerings such as income protection, digital health and financial wellness. As the number of employer benefits plans has increased, with each plan subject to many different business rules and requirements, demand for the Benefitfocus Platform has grown.\nWe serve two separate but related market segments. The employer market which consists of employers offering benefits to their employees. Within this segment, we mainly target large employers with more than 1,000 employees, of which we believe there are over 18,000 in the United States. In our other market segment, we sell our solutions to insurance carriers, enabling us to expand our overall footprint in the benefits marketplace by aggregating many key constituents, including consumers, employers, and brokers. Our business model capitalizes on the close relationship between carriers and their members, and the carriers' ability to serve as lead generators for potential employer customers. Carriers pay for services at a rate reflective of the aggregated nature of their customer base on a per application basis. Carriers can then deploy their applications to employer groups and members. As employers become direct customers through our employer segment, we provide them our platform offering that bundles many software applications into a comprehensive benefits solution through Benefitfocus Marketplace. We believe our presence in both the employer and insurance carrier markets gives us a strong position at the center of the benefits ecosystem.\nWe sell the Benefitfocus Platform on a subscription basis, typically through annual contracts with employer customers and multi-year contracts with our insurance carrier customers, with subscription fees paid monthly, quarterly and annually. The multi-year contracts with our carrier customers are generally only cancellable by the carrier in an instance of our uncured breach, although some of our carrier customers are able to terminate their respective contracts without cause or for convenience. Software services revenue accounted for approximately 85%, 87%, and 87% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAnother component of our revenue is professional services. We derive the majority of our professional services revenue from the implementation of our customers onto our platform, which typically includes discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing, and training. In general, it takes from four to six months to implement a new employer customer's benefits systems and eight to 10 months to implement a new carrier customer's benefits systems. We also provide customer support services and customized media content that supports our customers' effort to educate and communicate with consumers. Professional services revenue accounted for approximately 15%, 13%, and 13% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncreasing our base of large employer customers is an important source of revenue growth for us. We actively pursue new employer customers in the U.S. market, and we have increased the number of large employer customers utilizing our solutions from 141 as of December 31, 2010 to 915 as of December 31, 2017, a 30.6% compound annual growth rate. We believe that our continued innovation and new solutions, such as online benefits marketplaces, also known as private exchanges, account services, enhanced mobile offerings, and more robust data analytics capabilities will help us attract additional large employer customers and increase our revenue from existing customers.\nWe believe that there is a substantial market for our services, and we have been investing in growth over the past six years. In particular, we have continued to invest in technology and services to better serve our larger employer customers, which we believe are an important source of growth for our business. We have also substantially increased our marketing and sales efforts and expect those increased efforts to continue. As we have invested in growth, we have had operating losses in each of the last seven years, and expect our operating losses to continue for at least the next year. Due to the nature of our customer relationships, which have been stable in spite of some customer losses over the past years, and the subscription nature of our financial model, we believe that our current investment in growth should lead to substantially increased revenue, which will allow us to achieve profitability in the relatively near future. Of course, our ability to achieve profitability will continue to be subject to many factors beyond our control.\nKey Financial and Operating Performance Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and project our future performance. These metrics help us develop and refine our growth strategies and make strategic decisions. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating loss, as well as segment revenue and segment gross profit, in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Components of Operating Results\u201d. In addition, we utilize other key metrics as described below.\nNumber of Large Employer and Carrier Customers\nWe believe the number of large employer and carrier customers is a key indicator of our market penetration, growth, and future revenue. We have aggressively invested in and intend to continue to invest in our sales function to grow our customer base. We generally define a customer as an entity with an active software services contract as of the measurement date. The following table sets forth the number of large employer and carrier customers for the periods indicated:\n\nSoftware Services Revenue Retention Rate\nWe believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand the revenue they generate for us over time is an important component of our growth strategy and reflects the long-term value of our customer relationships. We measure our performance on this basis using a metric we refer to as our software services revenue retention rate. We calculate this metric for a particular period by establishing the group of our customers that had active contracts for a given period. We then calculate our software services revenue retention rate by taking the amount of software services revenue we recognized for this group in the subsequent comparable period (for which we are reporting the rate) and dividing it by the software services revenue we recognized for the group in the prior period.\nFor 2017, 2016 and 2015 our software services revenue retention rate exceeded 95%.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents our earnings before net interest and other expense, taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and costs not core to our business. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Please refer to Selected Consolidated Financial Data-Adjusted EBITDA\u201d in this report for a discussion of the limitations of adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most comparable GAAP measurement, respectively, for 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from software services fees, which consist primarily of monthly subscription fees paid to us by our employer and carrier customers for access to, and usage of, our cloud-based benefits software solutions for a specified contract term. We also derive revenue from professional services fees, which primarily include fees related to the implementation of our customers onto our platform. Our professional services typically include discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing, and training.\nThe following table sets forth a breakdown of our revenue between software services and professional services for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nWe generally recognize software services fees monthly based on the number of employees covered by the relevant benefits plans at contracted rates for a specified period of time, provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, access to our software has been granted to the customer and it is available for their use, the fee for the software services is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.\nWe defer recognition of our professional services fees paid by customers related to implementation services that are determined to not have stand-alone value and are sold with our software services, and recognize them, beginning once the related software services have commenced, ratably over the longer of the contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship, which was 7 years. We periodically evaluate the term over which revenue is recognized for professional services to reflect our experience with customer contract renewals.\nAs of July 1, 2015, we determined that we had established standalone value for the implementation services for the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution in the Employer segment as they are now sold separately from the software services. This was primarily due to the system integrators that have been trained and certified to perform these implementation services, the successful completion of an implementation by a trained system integrator, and the sale of several software subscription arrangements to customers in the Employer segment without the Company's implementation services. Accordingly, revenues related to implementation services for the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution in the Employer segment that are delivered after July 1, 2015 are recognized separately from the revenues earned from the Employer software subscription services. Revenues related to such implementation services are recognized at the time that the professional services have been completed and the related software services have commenced. Prior to July 1, 2015, we did not have standalone value for implementation services related to the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution as we had historically performed these services to support our customers' implementation of this solution. The incremental revenue from recognition of services upon delivery compared to recognition over the customer relationship period of 7 years was $2.3 million in twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nWe generally invoice our employer and carrier customers for software services in advance, in monthly, quarterly or annual installments. We invoice our employer customers for implementation fees at the inception of the arrangement. We generally invoice our carrier customers for implementation fees at various contractually defined times throughout the implementation process. Implementation fees that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue until recognized to revenue as described above.\nWe earn commissions from brokerage services from our voluntary benefit insurance offerings. We recognize revenue when these commissions are earned.\nWe will adopt the new revenue accounting standard on January 1, 2018. The new standard will significantly affect how we recognize revenue for our products and services. The expected effects of the new accounting standard are included in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverhead Allocation\nExpenses associated with our facilities, security, information technology, and depreciation and amortization, are allocated between cost of revenue and operating expenses based on employee headcount determined by the nature of work performed.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, for employees, whom we refer to as associates, providing services to our customers and supporting our SaaS platform infrastructure. Additional expenses in cost of revenue include co-location facility costs for our data centers, depreciation expense for computer equipment directly associated with generating revenue, infrastructure maintenance costs, professional fees, amortization expenses associated with capitalized software development costs, allocated overhead, and other direct costs.\nWe expense our cost of revenue as we incur the costs. However, the related revenue from fees we receive for our implementation services, performed before a customer is operating on our platform, that is determined to not have stand-alone value is deferred until the commencement of the monthly subscription and recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the related contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship. For those implementation services that have standalone value, the related revenue is recognized as revenue upon completion of service. Therefore, the cost incurred in providing these services is expensed in periods prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Our cost associated with providing implementation services has been significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost associated with providing our monthly subscription services due to the labor associated with implementation.\nWe plan to continue to expand our capacity to support our growth, which will result in higher cost of revenue in absolute dollars. However, we expect cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue to decline and gross margins to increase primarily from the growth of the percentage of our revenue from large employers and the realization of economies of scale driven by retention of our customer base.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Salaries and personnel-related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories. We expect to continue to hire new associates in these areas in order to support our anticipated revenue growth; however, we expect to decrease our operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, as we achieve economies of scale.\nSales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and commissions for our sales and marketing associates. We record expense for commissions at the time of contract signing. Additional expenses include advertising, lead generation, promotional event programs, corporate\ncommunications, travel, and allocated overhead. For instance, our most significant promotional event is our annual user and partner conference, One Place, which we have held annually. We expect our sales and marketing expense to increase, in absolute dollars, in the foreseeable future as we further increase the number of our sales and marketing professionals and expand our marketing activities in order to continue to grow our business.\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for our research and development associates. Additional expenses include costs related to the development, quality assurance, and testing of new technology, and enhancement of our existing platform technology, consulting, travel, and allocated overhead. We believe continuing to invest in research and development efforts is essential to maintaining our competitive position. We expect our research and development expense to decrease, as a percentage of revenue, as we achieve economies of scale.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for administrative, finance and accounting, information systems, legal, and human resource associates. Additional expenses include consulting and professional fees, insurance and other corporate expenses, and travel. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute terms as a result of ongoing public company costs, including those associated with compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations governing public companies, increased costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance, and increased professional services expenses, particularly associated with the implementation of new accounting standards.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income and expense consists primarily of interest income and expense and gain (loss) on disposal of property and equipment. Interest income represents interest received on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest incurred on outstanding borrowings under our financing obligations, capital leases and credit facility.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes. We incurred minimal income tax expense for 2017, 2016, and 2015. Net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were $253.9 million at December 31, 2017. State net operating loss carryforwards were approximately $221.2 million at December 31, 2017. Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2022, if not utilized. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act ( Tax Reform\u201d) was enacted. Among other things, we expect that the primary provision of Tax Reform to affect us will be the reduction to the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Accordingly, we revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the enacted tax rate and adjusted our valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2017, we have completed our accounting for the income tax effects of Tax Reform except for the impact of state tax conformity of each change and further evaluation of executive compensation. We are not able to determine a reasonable estimate for these items and expect to complete our analysis during 2018 as states make known their conformity with federal tax laws and additional transition guidance is provided related to executive compensation.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Statements of Operations Data\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands).\n\n (1) Cost of revenue and operating expenses include stock-based compensation expense as follows (in thousands): \n\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue for each of the periods indicated (as a percentage of revenue).\n\nOur Segments\nThe following table sets forth segment results for revenue and gross profit for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue\n\nGrowth in software services revenue was primarily attributable to existing customers adding covered users to our offerings, or volume increases, and also to existing customers purchasing additional products as well as to the net addition of new customers, as the number of large employer and carrier customers increased to 969 as of December 31, 2017 from 886 as of December 31, 2016.\nThe increase in professional services revenue was in part attributable to the recognition of $2.5 million of implementation services provided to newly activated customers and new products provided to existing customers, and the remainder from providing consulting services and enhancements to existing customers.\nSegment Revenue\n\nGrowth in our employer revenue was primarily attributable to a $17.6 million increase in our employer software services revenue driven mostly by new customers and volume increases, as well as additional products sold to existing customers. Additionally, employer professional services revenue increased $5.8 million due to implementation revenue from new customers and customer consulting to existing customers.\nThe slight decrease in carrier revenue was primarily attributable to a $0.9 million increase in professional services revenue, offset by a decrease of $1.0 million in software services revenue. The\nprofessional services revenue increase was primarily driven by additional support and discovery services to existing customers. Carrier software services revenue decreased as volume decreases from existing customers exceeded increases in revenue from new customers.\nCost of Revenue\n\nThe increase in cost of revenue in absolute terms was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and personnel-related costs to support an increased number of customers and volume, as well as professional fees associated with third-party deliveries. This increase included a decrease in stock-based compensation of $0.3 million. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue has continued to decrease as a result of economies of scale as our revenues have grown.\nGross Profit\n\nThe increase in software services gross profit was driven by a $16.6 million, or 8.2%, increase in software services revenue. This increase was partially offset by a $5.3 million, or 6.7%, increase in software services cost of revenue. Software services cost of revenue included $1.7 million of stock-based compensation expense for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and $10.4 million and $8.9 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe improvement in professional services gross loss was driven by a $6.8 million, or 21.4%, increase in professional services revenue and a decrease in professional services cost of revenue of $1.8 million. Professional services cost of revenue included $0.8 million and $1.1 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, professional services cost of revenue included $1.4 million and $1.2 million in depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAs discussed in Components of Operating Results-Cost of Revenue\u201d, we expense our cost of revenue as we incur the costs. However, recognition of the related revenue from implementation services performed before a customer is operating on our platform generally is deferred until the commencement of the monthly subscription. We recognize the revenue ratably over the longer of the related contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship, which is 7 years. Therefore, we expense the cost incurred in providing these services prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue.\nSegment Gross Profit\n\nThe increase in employer gross profit was driven by a $23.5 million, or 16.7%, increase in employer revenue being only partially offset by a $7.8 million, or 8.9%, increase in employer cost of revenue as we continued to achieve economies of scale. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to increased personnel-related costs to support our customer base as well as increased depreciation and amortization, technology infrastructure costs and security-related costs. Our employer cost of revenue included $1.9 million and $2.0 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, our employer cost of revenue included $7.3 million and $5.8 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nThe increase in carrier gross profit was driven by a decrease in carrier cost of revenue of $4.3 million, or 12.8%, in combination with carrier revenue being essentially flat. The decrease in cost of revenue was attributable to operational efficiencies achieved in supporting our carrier customers and a decrease in customer-specific development, as opposed to platform enhancements and development. Our carrier cost of revenue included $0.6 million and $0.8 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, our carrier cost of revenue included $4.5 million and $4.2 million in depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\n\nThe increase in sales and marketing expense was attributable to $9.0 million higher salaries and personnel-related costs as we continued to invest in our direct sales channel. We increased the number sales associates during 2017, including hiring our Executive Vice-President, Global Sales. This increase included $1.7 million increase in stock-based compensation. Additionally, travel-related expenses increased $2.6 million and marketing expense, professional fees, technology infrastructure costs and other operating costs increased by $1.8 million.\nThe decrease in research and development expense reflects a $3.5 million decrease in salaries and personnel-related costs as the result of a decrease in the number of associates engaged in research and development activities. This decrease includes a $1.5 million decrease in stock-based compensation. Additionally, costs related to external development and engineering consulting decreased $3.2 million.\nThe decrease in general and administrative expense was partly attributable to a $1.8 million decrease in salaries and personnel-related costs, which includes a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $1.3 million. Sales tax expense decreased $1.6 million related to resolving liabilities in certain states. We experienced additional decreases in professional and consulting fees of $1.0 million attributable to discontinuing the use of certain consultants during 2017 and a decrease in bad debt expense of $0.6 million.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nRevenue\n\nGrowth in software services revenue was primarily attributable to existing customers adding covered users to our offerings, or volume increases, and also to existing customers purchasing additional products as well as to the net addition of new customers, as the number of large employer and carrier customers increased to 886 as of December 31, 2016 from 777 as of December 31, 2015.\nThe increase in professional services revenue was in part attributable to the recognition of $7.5 million of implementation services provided to newly activated customers, new products provided to existing customers and $4.3 million attributable to the acceleration of the customer relationship period for certain customers.\nSegment Revenue\n\nGrowth in our employer revenue was primarily attributable to a $42.9 million increase in our employer software services revenue driven primarily by new customers and volume increases, as well as additional products sold to existing customers. Additionally, employer professional services revenue increased $2.7 million, including a $0.7 million increase from services with standalone value.\nThe increase in carrier revenue in absolute terms was primarily attributable to a $5.1 million increase in professional services revenue, offset by a decrease of $2.6 million in software services revenue. The professional services revenue increase was primarily driven by implementations related to additional products with existing customers and the acceleration of the customer relationship period for certain customers. Carrier software services revenue decreased as volume decreases from existing customers exceeded increases in revenue from new customers.\nCost of Revenue\n\nThe increase in cost of revenue in absolute terms was in part attributable to a $14.4 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs to support an increased number of customers and volume, as well as professional fees associated with third-party deliveries. This increase included an increase in stock-based compensation of $0.9 million. The remaining increase was attributable to other operating expenses related to security, technology infrastructure, depreciation and amortization, and facilities costs to support\nour organization. However, cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue has continued to decrease as a result of economies of scale as our revenues have grown.\nGross Profit\n\nThe increase in software services gross profit was driven by a $40.3 million, or 25.0%, increase in software services revenue. This increase was partially offset by a $19.9 million, or 33.7%, increase in software services cost of revenue. Software services cost of revenue included $1.7 million and $0.9 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $8.9 million and $7.7 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe improvement in professional services gross loss was driven by a $7.9 million, or 33.3%, increase in professional services revenue and a decrease in professional services cost of revenue of $2.1 million. Professional services cost of revenue included $1.1 million and $1.0 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, professional services cost of revenue included $1.2 million and $1.4 million in depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAs discussed in Components of Operating Results-Cost of Revenue\u201d, we expense our cost of revenue as we incur the costs. However, recognition of the related revenue from implementation services performed before a customer is operating on our platform is generally deferred until the commencement of the monthly subscription. Beginning at that time, we recognize the revenue ratably over the longer of the related contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship, which is 7 years. Therefore, we expense the cost incurred in providing these services prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue.\nSegment Gross Profit\n\nThe increase in employer gross profit was driven by a $45.7 million, or 48.2%, increase in employer revenue being only partially offset by a $26.3 million, or 43.0%, increase in employer cost of revenue as we continued to achieve economies of scale. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to increased personnel-related costs to support our customer base as well as increased depreciation and amortization, technology infrastructure costs and security-related costs. Our employer cost of revenue included $5.8 million and $4.6 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition, our employer cost of revenue included $2.0 million and $1.0 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe increase in carrier gross profit was driven by an increase in carrier revenue of $2.5 million, or 2.8%, in combination with a decrease in carrier cost of revenue of $8.5 million, or 20.3%. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in customer-specific development, as opposed to platform enhancements and development. Our carrier cost of revenue included $4.2 million and $4.5 million in depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition, our carrier cost of revenue included $0.8 million and $0.9 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\n\nThe decrease in sales and marketing expense was attributable to lower compensation expenses, including the impact of a significant carrier deal that occurred in the first quarter of 2015 and a large employer deal that occurred in the third quarter of 2015, as well as the departure of the Chief Commercial Officer in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, we experienced efficiencies that reduced travel-related expenses by $0.9 million and experienced a $0.6 million decrease in other operating expenses.\nThe increase in research and development expense in absolute terms was primarily attributable to a $4.5 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, including an increase in stock-based compensation of $2.1 million comprised of $0.5 million for the accrual of separation benefits related to the departure of our former Chief Technology Officer and $1.6 million attributable to equity awards granted to new and existing research and development associates. These increases were offset by a $2.0 million increase of personnel-related cost capitalized as part of software development. Additionally, we experienced a $0.9 million increase in engineering consulting fees for assistance in product development and a $0.9 million increase in technology infrastructure costs.\nThe increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a $5.7 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs comprised of a $4.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and a $1.2 million increase due to additional general and administrative headcount and the accrual of separation benefits related the retirement of our former Chief Financial Officer. The increase in stock-based compensation is partly attributable to the issuance of stock-based awards in lieu of cash compensation to certain senior executives and a $3.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expense due to additional grants. We also experienced a $1.2 million increase in facilities costs, depreciation expense and technology infrastructure costs.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results might differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from software services fees, which consist primarily of monthly subscription fees paid by customers for access to and usage of our cloud-based benefits software solutions for a specified contract term. We also derive revenue from professional services which primarily include fees related to the integration of customers' systems with our platform, which typically includes discovery, configuration, deployment, testing, and training.\nWe recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided, the fees to be paid by the customer are fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We consider delivery of our cloud-based software services has commenced once access to a configured and live instance on our platform has been delivered.\nOur arrangements generally contain multiple elements comprised of software services and professional services. We evaluate each element in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. An element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has standalone value and delivery of the undelivered element is probable and within our control.\nWhen multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separable into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified units of accounting based on their relative selling price. Multiple deliverable arrangements accounting guidance provides a hierarchy to use when determining the relative selling price for each unit of accounting. Vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) of selling price, based on the price at which the item is regularly sold by the vendor on a standalone basis, should be used if it exists. If VSOE of selling price is not available, third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d) of selling price is used to establish the selling price if it exists. VSOE and TPE do not currently exist for any of our deliverables. Accordingly, for arrangements with multiple deliverables that can be separated into different units of accounting, the arrangement fee is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on our best estimate of selling price. The amount of arrangement fee allocated is limited by contingent revenues, if any.\nEffective July 1, 2015, we determined that we had established standalone value for Benefitfocus Marketplace implementation services in the Employer segment as they are now sold separately from the software services. This was primarily due to the system integrators that have been trained and certified to perform these implementation services, the successful completion of an implementation by a trained system integrator, and the sale of several software subscription arrangements to customers in the Employer segment without our implementation services. Accordingly, revenues related to implementation services for the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution in the Employer segment that are delivered after July 1, 2015 are recognized separately from the revenues earned from the Employer software subscription services. Revenues related to such implementation services are recognized at the time that the professional services have been completed and the related software services have commenced. Prior to July 1, 2015, we did not have standalone value for implementation services related to the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution as we had historically performed these services to support customers' implementation of this solution. The incremental revenue from recognition of services upon delivery compared to recognition over the customer relationship period of 7 years was $2.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nCertain of our other professional services, including implementation services related to the Carrier segment, are not sold separately from the software services and there is no alternative use for them. As such, we have determined that those professional services do not have standalone value. Accordingly, software services and professional services are combined and recognized as a single unit of accounting. We generally recognize software services fees monthly based on the number of employees covered by the relevant benefits plans at contracted rates for a specified period of time, once the criteria for revenue recognition described above have been satisfied. We recognize revenue on Benefitfocus Marketplace implementation services in the Employer segment that have standalone value at the time the services have been completed. We defer recognition of revenue for fees from professional services that do not have standalone value and begin recognizing such revenue once the services are delivered and the related software services have commenced, ratably over the longer of the contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship. Costs incurred by us in connection with providing such professional services are charged to expense as incurred and are included in Cost of revenue.\u201d\nWe also earn commissions from brokerage services from our voluntary benefit insurance offerings. We recognize revenue when these commissions are earned.\nWe will adopt the new revenue accounting standard on January 1, 2018. The new standard will significantly affect how we recognize revenue for our products and services. The expected effects of the new accounting standard are included in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts and Returns\nWe state accounts receivable at realizable value, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and estimated returns. We maintain the allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of some customers to make payments as they become due. We base our estimated allowance on our analysis of past due amounts and ongoing credit evaluations. Historically, our actual collection experience has not varied significantly from our estimates, due primarily to our credit and", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this report beginning on page 19 for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nBenefitfocus provides a leading cloud-based benefits management platform for consumers, employers, insurance carriers, and brokers. The Benefitfocus Platform simplifies how organizations and individuals shop for, enroll in, manage, and exchange benefits. Our employer and insurance carrier customers rely on our platform to manage, scale and exchange data. Our web-based platform has a user-friendly interface designed to enable the insured consumers to access all of their benefits in one place. Our comprehensive solutions support core benefits plans, including healthcare, dental, life, and disability insurance, and voluntary benefits offerings such as income protection, digital health and financial wellness. As the number of employer benefits plans has increased, with each plan subject to many different business rules and requirements, demand for the Benefitfocus Platform has grown.\nWe serve two separate but related market segments. The employer market which consists of employers offering benefits to their employees. Within this segment, we mainly target large employers with more than 1,000 employees, of which we believe there are over 18,000 in the United States. In our other market segment, we sell our solutions to insurance carriers, enabling us to expand our overall footprint in the benefits marketplace by aggregating many key constituents, including consumers, employers, and brokers. Our business model capitalizes on the close relationship between carriers and their members, and the carriers' ability to serve as lead generators for potential employer customers. Carriers pay for services at a rate reflective of the aggregated nature of their customer base on a per application basis. Carriers can then deploy their applications to employer groups and members. As employers become direct customers through our employer segment, we provide them our platform offering that bundles many software applications into a comprehensive benefits solution through Benefitfocus Marketplace. We believe our presence in both the employer and insurance carrier markets gives us a strong position at the center of the benefits ecosystem.\nWe sell the Benefitfocus Platform on a subscription basis, typically through annual contracts with employer customers and multi-year contracts with our insurance carrier customers, with subscription fees paid monthly, quarterly and annually. The multi-year contracts with our carrier customers are generally only cancellable by the carrier in an instance of our uncured breach, although some of our carrier customers are able to terminate their respective contracts without cause or for convenience. Software services revenue accounted for approximately 85%, 87%, and 87% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAnother component of our revenue is professional services. We derive the majority of our professional services revenue from the implementation of our customers onto our platform, which typically includes discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing, and training. In general, it takes from four to six months to implement a new employer customer's benefits systems and eight to 10 months to implement a new carrier customer's benefits systems. We also provide customer support services and customized media content that supports our customers' effort to educate and communicate with consumers. Professional services revenue accounted for approximately 15%, 13%, and 13% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncreasing our base of large employer customers is an important source of revenue growth for us. We actively pursue new employer customers in the U.S. market, and we have increased the number of large employer customers utilizing our solutions from 141 as of December 31, 2010 to 915 as of December 31, 2017, a 30.6% compound annual growth rate. We believe that our continued innovation and new solutions, such as online benefits marketplaces, also known as private exchanges, account services, enhanced mobile offerings, and more robust data analytics capabilities will help us attract additional large employer customers and increase our revenue from existing customers.\nWe believe that there is a substantial market for our services, and we have been investing in growth over the past six years. In particular, we have continued to invest in technology and services to better serve our larger employer customers, which we believe are an important source of growth for our business. We have also substantially increased our marketing and sales efforts and expect those increased efforts to continue. As we have invested in growth, we have had operating losses in each of the last seven years, and expect our operating losses to continue for at least the next year. Due to the nature of our customer relationships, which have been stable in spite of some customer losses over the past years, and the subscription nature of our financial model, we believe that our current investment in growth should lead to substantially increased revenue, which will allow us to achieve profitability in the relatively near future. Of course, our ability to achieve profitability will continue to be subject to many factors beyond our control.\nKey Financial and Operating Performance Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and project our future performance. These metrics help us develop and refine our growth strategies and make strategic decisions. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating loss, as well as segment revenue and segment gross profit, in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Components of Operating Results\u201d. In addition, we utilize other key metrics as described below.\nNumber of Large Employer and Carrier Customers\nWe believe the number of large employer and carrier customers is a key indicator of our market penetration, growth, and future revenue. We have aggressively invested in and intend to continue to invest in our sales function to grow our customer base. We generally define a customer as an entity with an active software services contract as of the measurement date. The following table sets forth the number of large employer and carrier customers for the periods indicated:\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of customers:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Large employer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carrier\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSoftware Services Revenue Retention Rate\nWe believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand the revenue they generate for us over time is an important component of our growth strategy and reflects the long-term value of our customer relationships. We measure our performance on this basis using a metric we refer to as our software services revenue retention rate. We calculate this metric for a particular period by establishing the group of our customers that had active contracts for a given period. We then calculate our software services revenue retention rate by taking the amount of software services revenue we recognized for this group in the subsequent comparable period (for which we are reporting the rate) and dividing it by the software services revenue we recognized for the group in the prior period.\nFor 2017, 2016 and 2015 our software services revenue retention rate exceeded 95%.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents our earnings before net interest and other expense, taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and costs not core to our business. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Please refer to Selected Consolidated Financial Data-Adjusted EBITDA\u201d in this report for a discussion of the limitations of adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most comparable GAAP measurement, respectively, for 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from software services fees, which consist primarily of monthly subscription fees paid to us by our employer and carrier customers for access to, and usage of, our cloud-based benefits software solutions for a specified contract term. We also derive revenue from professional services fees, which primarily include fees related to the implementation of our customers onto our platform. Our professional services typically include discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing, and training.\nThe following table sets forth a breakdown of our revenue between software services and professional services for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 218,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 201,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 161,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 256,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 233,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 185,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generally recognize software services fees monthly based on the number of employees covered by the relevant benefits plans at contracted rates for a specified period of time, provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, access to our software has been granted to the customer and it is available for their use, the fee for the software services is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.\nWe defer recognition of our professional services fees paid by customers related to implementation services that are determined to not have stand-alone value and are sold with our software services, and recognize them, beginning once the related software services have commenced, ratably over the longer of the contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship, which was 7 years. We periodically evaluate the term over which revenue is recognized for professional services to reflect our experience with customer contract renewals.\nAs of July 1, 2015, we determined that we had established standalone value for the implementation services for the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution in the Employer segment as they are now sold separately from the software services. This was primarily due to the system integrators that have been trained and certified to perform these implementation services, the successful completion of an implementation by a trained system integrator, and the sale of several software subscription arrangements to customers in the Employer segment without the Company's implementation services. Accordingly, revenues related to implementation services for the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution in the Employer segment that are delivered after July 1, 2015 are recognized separately from the revenues earned from the Employer software subscription services. Revenues related to such implementation services are recognized at the time that the professional services have been completed and the related software services have commenced. Prior to July 1, 2015, we did not have standalone value for implementation services related to the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution as we had historically performed these services to support our customers' implementation of this solution. The incremental revenue from recognition of services upon delivery compared to recognition over the customer relationship period of 7 years was $2.3 million in twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nWe generally invoice our employer and carrier customers for software services in advance, in monthly, quarterly or annual installments. We invoice our employer customers for implementation fees at the inception of the arrangement. We generally invoice our carrier customers for implementation fees at various contractually defined times throughout the implementation process. Implementation fees that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue until recognized to revenue as described above.\nWe earn commissions from brokerage services from our voluntary benefit insurance offerings. We recognize revenue when these commissions are earned.\nWe will adopt the new revenue accounting standard on January 1, 2018. The new standard will significantly affect how we recognize revenue for our products and services. The expected effects of the new accounting standard are included in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverhead Allocation\nExpenses associated with our facilities, security, information technology, and depreciation and amortization, are allocated between cost of revenue and operating expenses based on employee headcount determined by the nature of work performed.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, for employees, whom we refer to as associates, providing services to our customers and supporting our SaaS platform infrastructure. Additional expenses in cost of revenue include co-location facility costs for our data centers, depreciation expense for computer equipment directly associated with generating revenue, infrastructure maintenance costs, professional fees, amortization expenses associated with capitalized software development costs, allocated overhead, and other direct costs.\nWe expense our cost of revenue as we incur the costs. However, the related revenue from fees we receive for our implementation services, performed before a customer is operating on our platform, that is determined to not have stand-alone value is deferred until the commencement of the monthly subscription and recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the related contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship. For those implementation services that have standalone value, the related revenue is recognized as revenue upon completion of service. Therefore, the cost incurred in providing these services is expensed in periods prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Our cost associated with providing implementation services has been significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost associated with providing our monthly subscription services due to the labor associated with implementation.\nWe plan to continue to expand our capacity to support our growth, which will result in higher cost of revenue in absolute dollars. However, we expect cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue to decline and gross margins to increase primarily from the growth of the percentage of our revenue from large employers and the realization of economies of scale driven by retention of our customer base.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Salaries and personnel-related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories. We expect to continue to hire new associates in these areas in order to support our anticipated revenue growth; however, we expect to decrease our operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, as we achieve economies of scale.\nSales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and commissions for our sales and marketing associates. We record expense for commissions at the time of contract signing. Additional expenses include advertising, lead generation, promotional event programs, corporate\ncommunications, travel, and allocated overhead. For instance, our most significant promotional event is our annual user and partner conference, One Place, which we have held annually. We expect our sales and marketing expense to increase, in absolute dollars, in the foreseeable future as we further increase the number of our sales and marketing professionals and expand our marketing activities in order to continue to grow our business.\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for our research and development associates. Additional expenses include costs related to the development, quality assurance, and testing of new technology, and enhancement of our existing platform technology, consulting, travel, and allocated overhead. We believe continuing to invest in research and development efforts is essential to maintaining our competitive position. We expect our research and development expense to decrease, as a percentage of revenue, as we achieve economies of scale.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for administrative, finance and accounting, information systems, legal, and human resource associates. Additional expenses include consulting and professional fees, insurance and other corporate expenses, and travel. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute terms as a result of ongoing public company costs, including those associated with compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations governing public companies, increased costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance, and increased professional services expenses, particularly associated with the implementation of new accounting standards.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income and expense consists primarily of interest income and expense and gain (loss) on disposal of property and equipment. Interest income represents interest received on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest incurred on outstanding borrowings under our financing obligations, capital leases and credit facility.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes. We incurred minimal income tax expense for 2017, 2016, and 2015. Net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were $253.9 million at December 31, 2017. State net operating loss carryforwards were approximately $221.2 million at December 31, 2017. Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2022, if not utilized. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act ( Tax Reform\u201d) was enacted. Among other things, we expect that the primary provision of Tax Reform to affect us will be the reduction to the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Accordingly, we revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the enacted tax rate and adjusted our valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2017, we have completed our accounting for the income tax effects of Tax Reform except for the impact of state tax conformity of each change and further evaluation of executive compensation. We are not able to determine a reasonable estimate for these items and expect to complete our analysis during 2018 as states make known their conformity with federal tax laws and additional transition guidance is provided related to executive compensation.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Statements of Operations Data\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations

The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to increased personnel-related costs to support our customer base as well as increased depreciation and amortization, technology infrastructure costs and security-related costs. Our employer cost of revenue included $5.8 million and $4.6 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition, our employer cost of revenue included $2.0 million and $1.0 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe increase in carrier gross profit was driven by an increase in carrier revenue of $2.5 million, or 2.8%, in combination with a decrease in carrier cost of revenue of $8.5 million, or 20.3%. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in customer-specific development, as opposed to platform enhancements and development. Our carrier cost of revenue included $4.2 million and $4.5 million in depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition, our carrier cost of revenue included $0.8 million and $0.9 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Period-to-Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,101\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in sales and marketing expense was attributable to lower compensation expenses, including the impact of a significant carrier deal that occurred in the first quarter of 2015 and a large employer deal that occurred in the third quarter of 2015, as well as the departure of the Chief Commercial Officer in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, we experienced efficiencies that reduced travel-related expenses by $0.9 million and experienced a $0.6 million decrease in other operating expenses.\nThe increase in research and development expense in absolute terms was primarily attributable to a $4.5 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, including an increase in stock-based compensation of $2.1 million comprised of $0.5 million for the accrual of separation benefits related to the departure of our former Chief Technology Officer and $1.6 million attributable to equity awards granted to new and existing research and development associates. These increases were offset by a $2.0 million increase of personnel-related cost capitalized as part of software development. Additionally, we experienced a $0.9 million increase in engineering consulting fees for assistance in product development and a $0.9 million increase in technology infrastructure costs.\nThe increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a $5.7 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs comprised of a $4.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and a $1.2 million increase due to additional general and administrative headcount and the accrual of separation benefits related the retirement of our former Chief Financial Officer. The increase in stock-based compensation is partly attributable to the issuance of stock-based awards in lieu of cash compensation to certain senior executives and a $3.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expense due to additional grants. We also experienced a $1.2 million increase in facilities costs, depreciation expense and technology infrastructure costs.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results might differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from software services fees, which consist primarily of monthly subscription fees paid by customers for access to and usage of our cloud-based benefits software solutions for a specified contract term. We also derive revenue from professional services which primarily include fees related to the integration of customers' systems with our platform, which typically includes discovery, configuration, deployment, testing, and training.\nWe recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided, the fees to be paid by the customer are fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We consider delivery of our cloud-based software services has commenced once access to a configured and live instance on our platform has been delivered.\nOur arrangements generally contain multiple elements comprised of software services and professional services. We evaluate each element in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. An element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has standalone value and delivery of the undelivered element is probable and within our control.\nWhen multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separable into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified units of accounting based on their relative selling price. Multiple deliverable arrangements accounting guidance provides a hierarchy to use when determining the relative selling price for each unit of accounting. Vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) of selling price, based on the price at which the item is regularly sold by the vendor on a standalone basis, should be used if it exists. If VSOE of selling price is not available, third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d) of selling price is used to establish the selling price if it exists. VSOE and TPE do not currently exist for any of our deliverables. Accordingly, for arrangements with multiple deliverables that can be separated into different units of accounting, the arrangement fee is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on our best estimate of selling price. The amount of arrangement fee allocated is limited by contingent revenues, if any.\nEffective July 1, 2015, we determined that we had established standalone value for Benefitfocus Marketplace implementation services in the Employer segment as they are now sold separately from the software services. This was primarily due to the system integrators that have been trained and certified to perform these implementation services, the successful completion of an implementation by a trained system integrator, and the sale of several software subscription arrangements to customers in the Employer segment without our implementation services. Accordingly, revenues related to implementation services for the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution in the Employer segment that are delivered after July 1, 2015 are recognized separately from the revenues earned from the Employer software subscription services. Revenues related to such implementation services are recognized at the time that the professional services have been completed and the related software services have commenced. Prior to July 1, 2015, we did not have standalone value for implementation services related to the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution as we had historically performed these services to support customers' implementation of this solution. The incremental revenue from recognition of services upon delivery compared to recognition over the customer relationship period of 7 years was $2.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nCertain of our other professional services, including implementation services related to the Carrier segment, are not sold separately from the software services and there is no alternative use for them. As such, we have determined that those professional services do not have standalone value. Accordingly, software services and professional services are combined and recognized as a single unit of accounting. We generally recognize software services fees monthly based on the number of employees covered by the relevant benefits plans at contracted rates for a specified period of time, once the criteria for revenue recognition described above have been satisfied. We recognize revenue on Benefitfocus Marketplace implementation services in the Employer segment that have standalone value at the time the services have been completed. We defer recognition of revenue for fees from professional services that do not have standalone value and begin recognizing such revenue once the services are delivered and the related software services have commenced, ratably over the longer of the contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship. Costs incurred by us in connection with providing such professional services are charged to expense as incurred and are included in Cost of revenue.\u201d\nWe also earn commissions from brokerage services from our voluntary benefit insurance offerings. We recognize revenue when these commissions are earned.\nWe will adopt the new revenue accounting standard on January 1, 2018. The new standard will significantly affect how we recognize revenue for our products and services. The expected effects of the new accounting standard are included in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts and Returns\nWe state accounts receivable at realizable value, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and estimated returns. We maintain the allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of some customers to make payments as they become due. We base our estimated allowance on our analysis of past due amounts and ongoing credit evaluations. Historically, our actual collection experience has not varied significantly from our estimates, due primarily to our credit and"}
