MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in this report.\nOur company\nWe are a hybrid mortgage REIT that opportunistically invests in a diversified risk-adjusted portfolio of Agency RMBS, Credit Investments and Single-Family Rental Properties. Our Credit Investments include our Residential Investments, Commercial Investments, and ABS Investments. We are a Maryland corporation and are externally managed by our Manager, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Angelo Gordon, pursuant to a management agreement. Our Manager, pursuant to a delegation agreement dated as of June 29, 2011, has delegated to Angelo Gordon the overall responsibility of its day-to-day duties and obligations arising under the management agreement. We conduct our operations to qualify and be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders as long as we maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. We also operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, under the symbol MITT. Our 8.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and our 8.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock trade on the NYSE under the symbols MITT-PA and MITT-PB, respectively.\nMarket conditions\nIncluding distressed sales, home prices nationwide increased by 5.1% on a year-over-year basis in November 2018 as compared with November 2017, according to data released by CoreLogic. This marks the 82nd consecutive monthly increase year-over-year in national home prices. According to CoreLogic's Homeowner Equity Report, in the third quarter of 2018, U.S. homeowners with mortgages have seen their equity increase by a total of nearly $775 billion since the third quarter of 2017. In the third quarter of 2018, as compared to the third quarter of 2017, the total number of mortgaged residential properties with negative equity (homes where the homeowner owes more on the home than the home is worth) decreased to 2.2 million homes from 2.6 million homes.\nHome prices have benefited from a tight supply of homes across the nation, and the negative equity epidemic has eased due to the rise in home prices over the past several years. Additionally, credit performance in terms of serious delinquencies and subsequent default rates continued to be stable-to-improving in 2018, as mortgage delinquency rates reported by the Federal Reserve declined from 3.6% to 2.8% from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018. This improvement has been driven by the strengthening of borrower's household balance sheets and unemployment remaining low.\nDuring the year, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds interest rate four times, with the most recent raise during the December meeting where the Fed raised the federal funds interest rate by 0.25% to a target range of 2.25%-2.50%. The labor market continued its expansion in 2018, as the rate of unemployment remained well below 5% during the year and inflation has improved to levels close to the Fed's 2.0% target for core PCE. In the December update of the Fed's Summary of Economic Projections, the median forecast for real GDP growth decreased in 2018 and 2019 and remained the same for 2020, while the median forecast for the unemployment rate remained the same for 2018 and 2019 and increased in 2020. The projection of the median Fed Funds rates, based on the individual assessments of the FOMC members, was 2.4% in 2018, 2.9% in 2019 and 3.1% in 2020.\nThe interest rate environment experienced volatility in 2018, as rates moved higher in concert with expectations for federal funds rate increases and then reversed course during the fourth quarter, falling sharply partially due to uncertainty related to the path of the economy in 2019. Agency mortgages underperformed for 2018, with nearly all the underperformance occurring in the fourth quarter. Agency RMBS spreads widened as interest rates declined, which primarily drove the decrease in MITT's book value for the year. During the fourth quarter, legacy RMBS spreads were wider but exhibited strong technical demand and favorable underlying fundamentals. The CRT market widened in sympathy with broader risk markets during the fourth quarter, with the widening most pronounced in the lower part of the capital structure. Despite this backdrop, there was little forced selling from CRT investors during the quarter.\nThe market conditions and trends outlined above may have a meaningful impact on our operating results and our existing portfolio and may cause us to adjust our investment and financing strategies over time as new opportunities emerge and the risk profile of our business changes.\nRecent government activity\nThe current regulatory environment may be impacted by future legislative developments, such as amendments to key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act or changes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including with respect to how long they will continue to be in existence, the extent of their roles in the market and what forms they will take. There is a lack of clarity around the impact of such potential reform on our operations.\nResults of operations\nOur operating results can be affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on the size and composition of our investment portfolio, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, our target assets in the marketplace, which can be impacted by unanticipated credit events, such as defaults, liquidations or delinquencies, experienced by borrowers whose mortgage loans are included in our investment portfolio. Our primary source of net income available to common stockholders is our net interest income, less our cost of hedging, which represents the difference between the interest earned on our investment portfolio and the costs of financing and hedging our investment portfolio. Our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates, prepayment speeds, as measured by the Constant Prepayment Rate (\"CPR\") on the Agency RMBS in our investment portfolio, and our funding and hedging costs.\nThe table below presents certain information from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and

million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $(11.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to lower prices on our securities and derivatives and other investments, which decreased our \"Unrealized gain/(loss) on real estate securities and loans, net,\" our \"Unrealized gain/(loss) on derivative and other instruments, net\", and our \"Net realized gain/(loss).\" Net income/(loss) available to common stockholders increased $54.9 million from $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $105.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to higher prices on our securities, which increased our \"Unrealized gain/(loss) on real estate securities and loans, net,\" coupled with higher derivative prices, which increased our \"Unrealized gain/(loss) on derivative and other instruments, net.\"\nInterest income\nInterest income is calculated using the effective interest method for our GAAP investment portfolio excluding SFR and calculated based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principal balance on our U.S. Treasury securities, if any.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nInterest income increased by $27.7 million from $128.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $156.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost of our GAAP investment portfolio (excluding SFR) and U.S. Treasury securities, if any, period over period by $0.4 billion from $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The increase in Other income pertains to insurance proceeds on our SFR portfolio and a premium received on a credit default swap.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, Other income was $55,000 and $0.4 million, respectively. The decrease in Other income pertains to decreased fees we received on one of our residential mortgage loan pools.\nManagement fee to affiliate\nOur management fee is based upon a percentage of our Stockholders' Equity. See the \"Contractual obligations\" section of this Part II, Item 7 for further detail on the calculation of our management fee and for the definition of Stockholders' Equity.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our management fees were $9.5 million and $9.8 million, respectively.

The decrease is a result of a decreased stock price for the year.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our equity based compensation to affiliate remained relatively unchanged.\nExcise tax\nExcise tax represents a four percent tax on the required amount of our ordinary income and net capital gains not distributed during the year. The quarterly expense is calculated in accordance with applicable tax regulations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 our excise tax remained relatively unchanged.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 our excise tax remained relatively unchanged.\nServicing fees\nWe incur servicing fee expenses in connection with the servicing of our Residential mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, we owned residential mortgage loans with fair market value of $186.1 million, $18.9 million, and $38.2 million, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 our servicing fees were $433,000 and $234,000, respectively. The increase in fees primarily pertains to net purchases of residential mortgage loans during the period.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 our servicing fees were $234,000 and $404,000, respectively. The decrease in fees primarily pertains to sales of residential mortgage loans during the period.\nProperty depreciation and amortization\nWe recognize straight line depreciation and amortization on our buildings, in-place lease intangibles and any capitalized acquisition, renovation, or other expense that improves or extends the useful life of our SFR portfolio. We acquired a stabilized portfolio of SFR in September 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, property depreciation and amortization was $2.3 million. There was no property depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThere was no property depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nProperty operating and maintenance expenses\nProperty operating and maintenance expenses may include property taxes, insurance, homeowner association fees, market-level personnel expenses, utility expenses, repairs and maintenance, leasing costs, and marketing expenses on our SFR portfolio. We acquired a stabilized portfolio of SFR in September 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, property operating and maintenance expenses were $1.9 million. There was no property operating and maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThere was no property operating and maintenance expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nProperty management fee\nProperty management fees represent costs associated with the oversight and management of our SFR portfolio. Our SFR portfolio is managed by Conrex. We acquired a stabilized portfolio of SFR in September 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our property management fee on our SFR portfolio was $0.3 million. There was no property management fee for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThere was no property management fee for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nEquity in earnings/(loss) from affiliates\nEquity in earnings/(loss) from affiliates represents our share of earnings and profits of investments held within affiliated entities. A majority of these investments are comprised of real estate securities, loans and our investment in AG Arc.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we recorded Equity in earnings/(loss) from affiliates of $15.6 million and $12.6 million, respectively. The increase primarily pertains to increased security prices causing an increase in unrealized gains on securities and loans.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we recorded Equity in earnings/(loss) from affiliates of $12.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The increase primarily pertains to an increased allocation of our capital to investments held within affiliated entities, increased security prices, and realized gains recognized on certain investments held by our affiliates.\nBook value per share\nAs of December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, our book value per common share was $17.21, $19.62, and $17.86 respectively.\nUndepreciated book value per share is a non-GAAP book value metric which adds accumulated depreciation and amortization back to book value to present an adjusted book value that incorporates the Company's single-family rental property portfolio at its undepreciated basis. This metric allows management to consider the investment portfolio exclusive of non-cash adjustments and facilitates the comparison of our financial performance to peer REITs. A reconciliation of book value per share to undepreciated book value per share as of December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 is presented below.\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book value per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back: Accumulated depreciation and amortization per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Undepreciated book value per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPer share amounts for book value are calculated using all outstanding common shares in accordance with GAAP, including all shares granted to AG REIT Management, LLC, our external manager, and our independent directors under our equity incentive plans as of quarter-end. Book value is calculated using stockholders' equity less net proceeds of the Company's 8.25% Series A and 8.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock as the numerator.\nPresentation of investment, financing and hedging activities\nIn the \"Investment activities,\" \"Financing activities,\" \"Hedging activities\" and \"Liquidity and capital resources\" sections of this Part II, Item 7, where we disclose our investment portfolio and the related financing arrangements, we have presented this information inclusive of (i) unconsolidated ownership interests in affiliates that are accounted for under GAAP using the equity method and (ii) TBAs, which are accounted for as derivatives under GAAP. Our investment portfolio and the related financing arrangements are presented along with a reconciliation to GAAP. This presentation of our investment portfolio is consistent with how our management evaluates the business, and we believe this presentation, when considered with the GAAP presentation, provides supplemental information useful for investors in evaluating our investment portfolio and financial condition. See Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of investments in debt and equity of affiliates and TBAs.\nNet interest margin and leverage ratio\nOur GAAP net interest margin is calculated by subtracting the weighted average cost of funds on our GAAP investment portfolio from the weighted average yield for our GAAP investment portfolio, which excludes cash held by us and any net TBA position. Both elements of cost of funds on our GAAP investment portfolio are weighted by the outstanding financing arrangements on our GAAP investment portfolio, securitized debt, and loan participation payable at quarter end, exclusive of repurchase agreements associated with U.S. Treasury securities, if any.\nNet interest margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by subtracting the weighted average cost of funds from the weighted average yield for our investment portfolio, which excludes cash held by us and any net TBA position. The weighted average yield on our Agency RMBS portfolio and our credit portfolio represents an effective interest rate, which utilizes all estimates of future cash flows and adjusts for actual prepayment and cash flow activity as of year-end. The weighted average yield on our SFR portfolio represents annualized fourth quarter net operating income divided by the carrying value of our SFR portfolio gross of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Net operating income on our SFR portfolio is comprised of rental income and other SFR related income less property operating and maintenance expenses and property management fees. The calculation of weighted average yield is weighted on net carrying value. The weighted average cost of funds is the sum of the weighted average funding costs on total financing outstanding at year-end and our weighted average hedging cost, which is the weighted average of the net pay rate on our interest rate swaps, the net receive/pay rate on our Treasury long and short positions, respectively, and the net receivable rate on our IO index derivatives, if any. Both elements of cost of funds are weighted by the outstanding financing arrangements on our investment portfolio, securitized debt, and loan participation payable at year-end, exclusive of repurchase agreements associated with U.S. Treasury securities.\nNet interest margin and leverage ratio can be used to calculate the return on equity of our investment portfolio and Management believes that these metrics should be considered together when evaluating the performance of our investment portfolio. See the \"Financing activities\" section below for more detail on our leverage ratio.\nThe chart below sets forth the net interest margin and leverage ratio from our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and a reconciliation to our GAAP investment portfolio:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

leverage.\nCore Earnings\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2018, we determined that we should modify our definition and calculation of Core Earnings,\u201d a non-GAAP financial measure, to exclude realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of Arc Home's net mortgage servicing rights as well as realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivatives that are intended to offset changes in the fair value of those net mortgage servicing rights held at Arc Home, our subsidiary licensed mortgage originator. The modification to our definition and calculation of Core Earnings is consistent with our treatment of excluding realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of Excess MSRs held directly by us.\nWe define Core Earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as Net Income/(loss) available to common stockholders excluding (i) unrealized gains/(losses) on securities, loans, derivatives and other investments and realized gains/(losses) on the sale or termination of such instruments, (ii) beginning with Q2 2018, as a policy change, any transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of our investments, (iii) beginning with Q3 2018, concurrent with a change in our business, any depreciation or amortization expense related to our SFR portfolio, (iv) beginning with Q3 2018, as a policy change, accrued deal related performance fees payable to Arc Home and third party operators to the extent the primary component of the accrual relates to items that are excluded from Core Earnings, such as unrealized and realized gains/(losses), and (v) beginning with Q4 2018 and applied retrospectively, as a policy change, realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of Arc Home's net mortgage servicing rights as well as realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivatives that are intended to offset changes in the fair value of those net mortgage servicing rights. Items (i) through (v) above include any amounts related to those items held in affiliated entities. Management considers the transaction related expenses referenced in (ii) above to be similar to realized losses incurred at acquisition or disposition and does not view them as being part of its core operations. Management views the exclusion described in (v) above to be consistent with how it calculates Core Earnings on the remainder of its portfolio. As defined, Core Earnings include the net interest income and other income earned on our investments on a yield adjusted basis, including TBA dollar roll income or any other investment activity that may earn or pay net interest or its economic equivalent. One of our objectives is to generate net income from net interest margin on the portfolio, and management uses Core Earnings to help measure this objective. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure, when considered with its GAAP financials, provides supplemental information useful for investors as it enables them to evaluate our current core performance using the same measure that management uses to operate the business. This metric, in conjunction with related GAAP measures, provides greater transparency into the information used by our management team in its financial and operational decision-making. Our presentation of Core Earnings may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies, who may use different calculations. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our GAAP financial results and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Refer to the \"Results of Operations\" section above for a detailed discussion of our GAAP financial results.\nA reconciliation of Net Income/(loss) available to common stockholders to Core Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 is set forth below (in thousands, except per share data):\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income/(loss) available to common stockholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,901\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add (Deduct):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized (gain)/loss\n</td> <td>39,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar roll income\n</td> <td>1,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in (earnings)/loss from affiliates\n</td> <td>(15,593\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,622\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,519\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income and expenses from equity method investments (a)\n</td> <td>6,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction related expenses and deal related performance fees (b)(c)\n</td> <td>2,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>2,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>(122\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized (gain)/loss on real estate securities and loans, net\n</td> <td>20,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45,529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,673\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized (gain)/loss on derivative and other instruments, net\n</td> <td>13,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,813\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,613\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core Earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core Earnings, per Diluted Share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, $0.5 million or $0.02 per share, $1.1 million or $0.04 per share, and $0.4 million or $0.02 per share, respectively, of realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of Arc Home's net mortgage servicing rights and corresponding derivatives were excluded from Core Earnings per diluted share as a result of our modification to the definition and calculation of Core Earnings in Q4 2018.

Our Credit Investments include our Residential Investments, Commercial Investments, and ABS Investments.\nThe risk-reward profile of our investment opportunities changes continuously with the market, with labor, housing and economic fundamentals, and with U.S. monetary policy, among others. As a result, in reacting to market conditions and taking into account a variety of other factors, including liquidity, duration, interest rate expectations and hedging, the mix of our assets changes over time as we opportunistically deploy capital.\nWe evaluate investments in Agency RMBS using factors including expected future prepayment trends, supply of and demand for Agency RMBS, costs of financing, costs of hedging, expected future interest rate volatility and the overall shape of the U.S. Treasury and interest rate swap yield curves. Prepayment speeds, as reflected by the CPR, and interest rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. In general, as prepayment speeds on our Agency RMBS portfolio increase, the related purchase premium amortization increases, thereby reducing the net yield on such assets.\nOur credit investments are subject to risk of loss with regard to principal and interest payments. We evaluate each investment in our credit portfolio based on the characteristics of the underlying collateral and the securitization structure. We maintain a comprehensive portfolio management process that generally includes day-to-day oversight by the portfolio management team and a quarterly credit review process for each investment that examines the need for a potential reduction in accretable yield, missed or late contractual payments, significant declines in collateral performance, prepayments, projected defaults, loss severities and other data which may indicate a potential issue in our ability to recover our capital from the investment. These processes are designed to enable our Manager to evaluate and proactively manage asset-specific credit issues and identify credit trends on a portfolio-wide basis. Nevertheless, we cannot be certain that our review will identify all issues within our portfolio due to, among other things, adverse economic conditions or events adversely affecting specific assets. Therefore, potential future losses may also stem from issues with our investments that are not identified by our credit reviews.\nOur SFR portfolio is comprised of 1,225 properties located predominantly in the Southeast United States. The values of these properties are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to: national, regional and local economic conditions, local real estate conditions, construction quality, age, and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar codes.\nThe following table presents a detailed break-down of our

This was due to an increase in interest rates for 2018 as the average 10 year U.S. treasury rate was 2.327% for 2017 and 2.751% for 2018.

In 2018 and 2017, our leverage has primarily been in the form of repurchase agreements, facilities, and securitized debt. Repurchase agreements involve the sale and a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the transferred assets or similar assets at a future date. The amount borrowed generally is equal to the fair value of the assets pledged less an agreed-upon discount, referred to as a \"haircut.\" The size of the haircut reflects the perceived risk associated with the pledged asset. Haircuts may change as our financing arrangements mature or roll and are sensitive to governmental regulations. We did not experience fluctuations in our haircuts that caused us to alter our business and financing strategies for the year ended December 31, 2018, but we continue to monitor the regulatory environment, which may influence the timing and amount of our financing activity. We seek to obtain financing from multiple different counterparties in order to reduce our financing risk related to any single counterparty. We had outstanding debt with 31 and 27 counterparties at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nThe vast majority of our financing arrangements are repurchase agreements. Our repurchase agreements are accounted for as financings and require the repurchase of the transferred securities or loans or repayment of the advance at the end of each agreement's term, typically 30 to 90 days. If we maintain the beneficial interest in the specific assets pledged during the term of the borrowing, we receive the related principal and interest payments. If we do not maintain the beneficial interest in the specific assets pledged during the term of the borrowing, we will have the related principal and interest payments remitted to us by the lender. Interest rates on borrowings are fixed based on prevailing rates corresponding to the terms of the borrowings, and interest is paid at the termination of the borrowing at which time we may enter into a new borrowing arrangement at prevailing market rates with the same counterparty or repay that counterparty and negotiate financing with a different counterparty. In response to declines in fair value of pledged assets due to changes in market conditions or the publishing of monthly security paydown factors, lenders typically require us to post additional assets as collateral, pay down borrowings or establish cash margin accounts with the counterparties in order to re-establish the agreed-upon collateral requirements, referred to as margin calls. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we have met all margin call requirements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we noted changes in the spread of our financing arrangements. The Fed raised the federal funds interest rate by 25 bps in each of March 2018, June 2018, September 2018 and December 2018. In addition, our financing arrangement composition changed throughout 2018 as a result of the shift in the composition of our Investment Portfolio. Throughout 2018, we purchased more Re/Non-Performing and New Origination Loans, whose financing carries a higher financing cost than other credit assets in our Investment Portfolio. In addition, we purchased our SFR portfolio in 2018 and obtained financing, which also carries a higher financing cost than other assets in our Investment Portfolio. As a result, our cost of financing increased by 121 bps from 1.98% at December 31, 2017 to 3.19% at December 31, 2018.\nThe following table presents the quarter-end balance, average quarterly balance and maximum balance at any month-end for our (i) financing arrangements on our investment portfolio, U.S Treasury securities, and FHLBC Advances, and (ii) financing arrangements through affiliated entities, excluding any financing utilized in our investment in AG Arc, with a reconciliation of all quarterly figures to GAAP.

investment portfolio increases primarily through equity capital raises and as we increase our investment allocation to Agency RMBS and (ii) decrease as the size of our portfolio decreases through asset sales, principal paydowns, and as we increase our investment allocation to credit investments. Credit investments and investments in SFR, due to their risk profile, have lower leverage ratios than Agency RMBS, which restricts our financing counterparties from providing as much financing to us and lowers the balance of our total financing.\nFinancing arrangements on our investment portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we have entered into financing arrangements on our investment portfolio with 44 and 39 counterparties, respectively, under which we had outstanding debt with 31 and 27 counterparties, respectively, inclusive of financing arrangements in affiliated entities. See Note 8 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our material financing arrangements.\nOur financing arrangements generally include customary representations, warranties, and covenants, but may also contain more restrictive supplemental terms and conditions. Although specific to each MRA, typical supplemental terms include requirements of minimum equity, leverage ratios, performance triggers or other financial ratios.\nThe following table presents a summary of financial information related to financing arrangements related to our Investment Portfolio as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Securities and Loans Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Single-Family Rental Properties Segment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SFR\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing Arrangements Maturing Within: (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average\nFunding Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average\nFunding Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average\nFunding Cost\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overnight\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>30 days or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,093,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>482,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>31-60 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>658,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>274,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>61-90 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.89\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>91-180 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 180 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>237,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total: Non-GAAP Basis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,805,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,055,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in Debt and Equity of Affiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.79\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total: GAAP Basis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,805,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>915,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2018, our weighted average days to maturity was 143 days and our weighted average original days to maturity was 218 days on a GAAP Basis.

The Participation Interest bore interest at a rate of LIBOR+ 10.00% with a LIBOR floor of 0.25%. We determined that the Participation Interest should be consolidated under ASC 860 due to the fact that the sale of the Participation Interest did not meet the sales criteria established under ASC 860. The commercial loan was paid off in full in February 2017. The principal and interest due on the Participation Interest was paid from these proceeds.\nLeverage\nWe define non-GAAP \"at-risk\" leverage as the sum of: (i) our GAAP financing arrangements, (ii) financing arrangements held through affiliated entities but exclusive of any financing utilized through AG Arc (iii) the amount payable on purchases that have not yet settled less the financing remaining on sales that have not yet settled, (iv) the consolidated tranche issued by the Consolidated VIE, (v) the Participation Interest and (vi) our net TBA position (at cost). Our calculations of each type of leverage exclude financing arrangements and net receivables/payables on unsettled trades pertaining to U.S. Treasury securities due to the highly liquid and temporary nature of these investments. The calculations in the tables below divide our leverage calculations by our GAAP stockholders' equity to derive our leverage ratios.

Specifically, we may seek to hedge our exposure to potential interest rate mismatches between the interest we earn on our investments and our borrowing costs caused by fluctuations in interest rates. In utilizing leverage and interest rate derivatives, our objectives are to improve risk-adjusted returns and, where possible, to lock in, on a long-term basis, a spread between the yield on our assets and the costs of our financing and hedging. Derivatives have not been designated as hedging instruments for GAAP. We do not hedge the financing on our Single-Family Rental Properties Segment. Refer to the tables below for a summary of our derivative instruments.\nOur centrally cleared trades require that we post an \"initial margin\" to our counterparties of an amount determined by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (\"CME\") and the London Clearing House (\"LCH\"), the central clearinghouses (\"CCPs\") through which those trades are cleared, which is generally intended to be set at a level sufficient to protect the CCPs from the maximum estimated single-day price movement in that market participant's contracts. We also exchange cash \"variation margin\" with our counterparties on our centrally cleared trades based upon daily changes in the fair value as measured by the CCPs. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, as a result of an amendment to the CCPs' rule book, which governs their central clearing activities, the daily exchange of variation margin associated with a CCP instrument is legally characterized as the daily settlement of the derivative instrument itself, as opposed to a pledge of collateral. Accordingly, beginning in 2017, we account for the daily receipt or payment of variation margin associated with our centrally cleared interest rate swaps and futures as a direct reduction to the carrying value of the interest rate swap and future derivative asset or liability, respectively. Beginning in 2017, the carrying amount of centrally cleared interest rate swaps and futures reflected in our consolidated balance sheets is equal to the unsettled fair value of such instruments. See Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nThe following table presents the fair value of our derivative and other instruments and their balance sheet location at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 (in thousands).\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives and Other Instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>GAAP\nDesignation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance Sheet Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate swaps (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Hedge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate swaps (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Hedge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(317\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(450\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Swaptions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Hedge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>362\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short positions on U.S. Treasury Futures (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Hedge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short positions on U.S. Treasuries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Hedge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other liabilities (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,378\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,379\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2018, the Company applied a reduction in fair value of $26.0 million and $18.1 million to its interest rate swap assets and liabilities, respectively, related to variation margin.

to increases in interest rates, we use currently-paying and may use forward-starting, one- or three-month LIBOR-indexed, pay-fixed, receive-variable, interest rate swap agreements. This arrangement helps hedge our exposure to higher interest rates because the variable-rate payments received on the swap agreements help to offset additional interest accruing on the related borrowings due to the higher interest rate, leaving the fixed-rate payments to be paid on the swap agreements as our effective borrowing rate, subject to certain adjustments including changes in spreads between variable rates on the swap agreements and actual borrowing rates.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our interest rate swap positions consisted of pay-fixed interest rate swaps.

Federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT ordinary taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its net taxable income. Before we pay any dividend, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our financing arrangements and other debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our net taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. In addition, prior to the time we have fully deployed the net proceeds of our follow-on offerings to acquire assets in our target asset classes we may fund our quarterly distributions out of such net proceeds.\nAs mentioned above, our distribution requirements are based on taxable income rather than GAAP net income. The primary differences between taxable income and GAAP net income include (i) unrealized gains and losses associated with investment and derivative portfolios which are marked-to-market in current income for GAAP purposes, but excluded from taxable income until realized or settled, (ii) temporary differences related to amortization of premiums and discounts paid on investments, (iii) the timing and amount of deductions related to stock-based compensation, (iv) temporary differences related to the recognition of realized gains and losses on sold investments and certain terminated derivatives, (v) taxes and (vi) methods of depreciation. Undistributed taxable income is based on current estimates and is not finalized until we file our annual tax return, typically in September of the following year. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had estimated undistributed taxable income of approximately $1.58 per share.\nThe following tables detail our common stock dividends during the years ended

</tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and capital resources\nOur liquidity determines our ability to meet our cash obligations, including commitments to make distributions to our stockholders, pay our expenses, finance our investments and satisfy other general business needs. Our principal sources of cash as of December 31, 2018 consisted of borrowings under financing arrangements, payments of principal and interest we receive on our Agency RMBS and credit portfolio, cash generated from our operating results, and proceeds from capital market transactions. We typically use cash to repay principal and interest on our financing arrangements, to purchase real estate securities, loans and other real estate related assets, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, and to fund our operations. At December 31, 2018, we had $88.0 million available to support our liquidity needs, comprised of $31.6 million of cash, $55.3 million of Agency fixed rate securities and CMOs that have not been pledged as collateral under any of our financing arrangements and $1.1 million of U.S. Treasury securities that have not been pledged as collateral under any of our financing arrangements. Refer to the \"Contractual obligations\" section of this Part II, Item 7 for additional obligations that could impact our liquidity.\nLeverage\nThe amount of leverage we may deploy for particular assets depends upon our Manager's assessment of the credit and other risks of those assets, and also depends on any limitations placed upon us through covenants contained in our financing arrangements. We generate income principally from the yields earned on our investments and, to the extent that leverage is deployed, on the difference between the yields earned on our investments and our cost of borrowing and the cost of any hedging activities. Subject to maintaining both our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and our Investment Company Act exemption, to the extent leverage is deployed, we may use a number of sources to finance our investments.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had financing arrangements with 44 counterparties, allowing us to utilize leverage in our operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had debt outstanding of $3.0 billion from 31 counterparties, inclusive of financing arrangements through affiliated entities. The borrowings under financing arrangements have maturities between January 2, 2019 and October 10, 2023. These agreements generally include customary representations, warranties, and covenants, but may also contain more restrictive supplemental terms and conditions. Although specific to each lending agreement, typical supplemental terms include requirements of minimum equity, leverage ratios, performance triggers or other financial ratios. If we fail to meet or satisfy any covenants, supplemental terms or representations and warranties, we would be in default under these agreements and our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the agreements to be immediately due and payable, enforce their respective interests against collateral pledged under such agreements and restrict our ability to make additional borrowings. Certain financing arrangements may contain cross-default provisions, so that if a default occurs under any one agreement, the lenders under our other agreements could also declare a default.\nUnder our financing arrangements, we may be required to pledge additional assets to our lenders in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral, which may\ntake the form of additional securities or cash. Certain securities that are pledged as collateral under our financing arrangements are in unrealized loss positions.\nThe following table presents contractual maturity information for our financing arrangements at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overnight\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>30 days or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,576,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,106,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>31 to 60 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>933,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>611,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>61 to 90 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>91-180 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 180 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>339,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total: Non-GAAP Basis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,962,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,011,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Investments in Debt and Equity of Affiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total: GAAP Basis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,822,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,004,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs described above in the \"Financing activities\" section of this Part II, Item 7, we entered into the Resecuritization in 2014 that resulted in the consolidation of the VIE created with the SPE.

See Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail.\nAs described above in the \"Financing activities\" section of this Part II, Item 7, we originated a $12.0 million commercial loan and transferred the Participation Interest to an unaffiliated third party. We recorded proceeds from the transfer in the \"Cash Flows from Financing Activities\" section of the consolidated statement of cash flows. The commercial loan was paid off in full in February 2017.

When the fair value of the assets pledged as collateral to secure a financing arrangement decreases to the point where the difference between the collateral fair value and the financing arrangement amount is less than the haircut, our lenders may issue a \"margin call,\" which requires us to post additional collateral to the lender in the form of additional assets or cash. Under our repurchase facilities, our lenders have full discretion to determine the fair value of the securities we pledge to them. Our lenders typically value assets based on recent trades in the market. Lenders also issue margin calls as the published current principal balance factors change on the pool of mortgages underlying the securities pledged as collateral when scheduled and unscheduled paydowns are announced monthly. We experience margin calls in the ordinary course of our business. In seeking to manage effectively the margin requirements established by our lenders, we maintain a position of cash and unpledged Agency RMBS. We refer to this position as our \"liquidity.\" The level of liquidity we have available to meet margin calls is directly affected by our leverage levels, our haircuts and the price changes on our securities. If interest rates increase or if credit spreads widen, then the prices of our collateral (and our unpledged assets that constitute our liquidity) will decline, we will experience margin calls, and we will need to use our liquidity to meet the margin calls. There can be no assurance that we will maintain sufficient levels of liquidity to meet any margin calls. If our haircuts increase, our liquidity will proportionately decrease. In addition, if we increase our borrowings, our liquidity will decrease by the amount of additional haircut on the increased level of indebtedness. We intend to maintain a level of liquidity in relation to our assets that enables us to meet reasonably anticipated margin calls but that also allows us to be substantially invested in securities. We may misjudge the appropriate amount of our liquidity by maintaining excessive liquidity, which would lower our investment returns, or by maintaining insufficient liquidity, which would force us to liquidate assets into potentially unfavorable market conditions and harm our results of operations and financial condition. Further, an unexpected rise in interest rates and a corresponding fall in the fair value of our securities may also force us to liquidate assets under difficult market conditions, thereby harming our results of operations and financial condition, in an effort to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet increased margin calls.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in this report.\nOur company\nWe are a hybrid mortgage REIT that opportunistically invests in a diversified risk-adjusted portfolio of Agency RMBS, Credit Investments and Single-Family Rental Properties. Our Credit Investments include our Residential Investments, Commercial Investments, and ABS Investments. We are a Maryland corporation and are externally managed by our Manager, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Angelo Gordon, pursuant to a management agreement. Our Manager, pursuant to a delegation agreement dated as of June 29, 2011, has delegated to Angelo Gordon the overall responsibility of its day-to-day duties and obligations arising under the management agreement. We conduct our operations to qualify and be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders as long as we maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. We also operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, under the symbol MITT. Our 8.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and our 8.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock trade on the NYSE under the symbols MITT-PA and MITT-PB, respectively.\nMarket conditions\nIncluding distressed sales, home prices nationwide increased by 5.1% on a year-over-year basis in November 2018 as compared with November 2017, according to data released by CoreLogic. This marks the 82nd consecutive monthly increase year-over-year in national home prices. According to CoreLogic's Homeowner Equity Report, in the third quarter of 2018, U.S. homeowners with mortgages have seen their equity increase by a total of nearly $775 billion since the third quarter of 2017. In the third quarter of 2018, as compared to the third quarter of 2017, the total number of mortgaged residential properties with negative equity (homes where the homeowner owes more on the home than the home is worth) decreased to 2.2 million homes from 2.6 million homes.\nHome prices have benefited from a tight supply of homes across the nation, and the negative equity epidemic has eased due to the rise in home prices over the past several years. Additionally, credit performance in terms of serious delinquencies and subsequent default rates continued to be stable-to-improving in 2018, as mortgage delinquency rates reported by the Federal Reserve declined from 3.6% to 2.8% from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018. This improvement has been driven by the strengthening of borrower's household balance sheets and unemployment remaining low.\nDuring the year, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds interest rate four times, with the most recent raise during the December meeting where the Fed raised the federal funds interest rate by 0.25% to a target range of 2.25%-2.50%. The labor market continued its expansion in 2018, as the rate of unemployment remained well below 5% during the year and inflation has improved to levels close to the Fed's 2.0% target for core PCE. In the December update of the Fed's Summary of Economic Projections, the median forecast for real GDP growth decreased in 2018 and 2019 and remained the same for 2020, while the median forecast for the unemployment rate remained the same for 2018 and 2019 and increased in 2020. The projection of the median Fed Funds rates, based on the individual assessments of the FOMC members, was 2.4% in 2018, 2.9% in 2019 and 3.1% in 2020.\nThe interest rate environment experienced volatility in 2018, as rates moved higher in concert with expectations for federal funds rate increases and then reversed course during the fourth quarter, falling sharply partially due to uncertainty related to the path of the economy in 2019. Agency mortgages underperformed for 2018, with nearly all the underperformance occurring in the fourth quarter. Agency RMBS spreads widened as interest rates declined, which primarily drove the decrease in MITT's book value for the year. During the fourth quarter, legacy RMBS spreads were wider but exhibited strong technical demand and favorable underlying fundamentals. The CRT market widened in sympathy with broader risk markets during the fourth quarter, with the widening most pronounced in the lower part of the capital structure. Despite this backdrop, there was little forced selling from CRT investors during the quarter.\nThe market conditions and trends outlined above may have a meaningful impact on our operating results and our existing portfolio and may cause us to adjust our investment and financing strategies over time as new opportunities emerge and the risk profile of our business changes.\nRecent government activity\nThe current regulatory environment may be impacted by future legislative developments, such as amendments to key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act or changes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including with respect to how long they will continue to be in existence, the extent of their roles in the market and what forms they will take. There is a lack of clarity around the impact of such potential reform on our operations.\nResults of operations\nOur operating results can be affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on the size and composition of our investment portfolio, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, our target assets in the marketplace, which can be impacted by unanticipated credit events, such as defaults, liquidations or delinquencies, experienced by borrowers whose mortgage loans are included in our investment portfolio. Our primary source of net income available to common stockholders is our net interest income, less our cost of hedging, which represents the difference between the interest earned on our investment portfolio and the costs of financing and hedging our investment portfolio. Our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates, prepayment speeds, as measured by the Constant Prepayment Rate (\"CPR\") on the Agency RMBS in our investment portfolio, and our funding and hedging costs.\nThe table below presents certain information from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n\nNet Income/(Loss) Available to Common Stockholders\nNet income/(loss) available to common stockholders decreased $117.0 million from $105.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $(11.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to lower prices on our securities and derivatives and other investments, which decreased our \"Unrealized gain/(loss) on real estate securities and loans, net,\" our \"Unrealized gain/(loss) on derivative and other instruments, net\", and our \"Net realized gain/(loss).\" Net income/(loss) available to common stockholders increased $54.9 million from $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $105.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to higher prices on our securities, which increased our \"Unrealized gain/(loss) on real estate securities and loans, net,\" coupled with higher derivative prices, which increased our \"Unrealized gain/(loss) on derivative and other instruments, net.\"\nInterest income\nInterest income is calculated using the effective interest method for our GAAP investment portfolio excluding SFR and calculated based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principal balance on our U.S. Treasury securities, if any.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nInterest income increased by $27.7 million from $128.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $156.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost of our GAAP investment portfolio (excluding SFR) and U.S. Treasury securities, if any, period over period by $0.4 billion from $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The decrease in Other income pertains to decreased fees we received on one of our residential mortgage loan pools.\nManagement fee to affiliate\nOur management fee is based upon a percentage of our Stockholders' Equity. See the \"Contractual obligations\" section of this Part II, Item 7 for further detail on the calculation of our management fee and for the definition of Stockholders' Equity.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our management fees were $9.5 million and $9.8 million, respectively. Management fees decreased primarily due to the decrease in our Stockholders' Equity as calculated pursuant to our Management Agreement.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 our management fees were $9.8 million and $9.8 million, respectively.

The following table presents a summary of certain expenses within Other operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n\nEquity based compensation to affiliate\nEquity based compensation to affiliate represents the amortization of the fair value of our restricted stock units granted to our Manager remeasured quarterly, less the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares through the requisite period.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our equity based compensation to affiliate was $239,000 and $301,000, respectively. The decrease is a result of a decreased stock price for the year.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our equity based compensation to affiliate remained relatively unchanged.\nExcise tax\nExcise tax represents a four percent tax on the required amount of our ordinary income and net capital gains not distributed during the year. The quarterly expense is calculated in accordance with applicable tax regulations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 our excise tax remained relatively unchanged.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 our excise tax remained relatively unchanged.\nServicing fees\nWe incur servicing fee expenses in connection with the servicing of our Residential mortgage loans.

The increase in fees primarily pertains to net purchases of residential mortgage loans during the period.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 our servicing fees were $234,000 and $404,000, respectively. The decrease in fees primarily pertains to sales of residential mortgage loans during the period.\nProperty depreciation and amortization\nWe recognize straight line depreciation and amortization on our buildings, in-place lease intangibles and any capitalized acquisition, renovation, or other expense that improves or extends the useful life of our SFR portfolio. We acquired a stabilized portfolio of SFR in September 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, property depreciation and amortization was $2.3 million.

A majority of these investments are comprised of real estate securities, loans and our investment in AG Arc.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we recorded Equity in earnings/(loss) from affiliates of $15.6 million and $12.6 million, respectively. The increase primarily pertains to increased security prices causing an increase in unrealized gains on securities and loans.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we recorded Equity in earnings/(loss) from affiliates of $12.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The increase primarily pertains to an increased allocation of our capital to investments held within affiliated entities, increased security prices, and realized gains recognized on certain investments held by our affiliates.\nBook value per share\nAs of December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, our book value per common share was $17.21, $19.62, and $17.86 respectively.\nUndepreciated book value per share is a non-GAAP book value metric which adds accumulated depreciation and amortization back to book value to present an adjusted book value that incorporates the Company's single-family rental property portfolio at its undepreciated basis. This metric allows management to consider the investment portfolio exclusive of non-cash adjustments and facilitates the comparison of our financial performance to peer REITs. A reconciliation of book value per share to undepreciated book value per share as of December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 is presented below.\n\nPer share amounts for book value are calculated using all outstanding common shares in accordance with GAAP, including all shares granted to AG REIT Management, LLC, our external manager, and our independent directors under our equity incentive plans as of quarter-end. Book value is calculated using stockholders' equity less net proceeds of the Company's 8.25% Series A and 8.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock as the numerator.\nPresentation of investment, financing and hedging activities\nIn the \"Investment activities,\" \"Financing activities,\" \"Hedging activities\" and \"Liquidity and capital resources\" sections of this Part II, Item 7, where we disclose our investment portfolio and the related financing arrangements, we have presented this information inclusive of (i) unconsolidated ownership interests in affiliates that are accounted for under GAAP using the equity method and (ii) TBAs, which are accounted for as derivatives under GAAP. Our investment portfolio and the related financing arrangements are presented along with a reconciliation to GAAP. This presentation of our investment portfolio is consistent with how our management evaluates the business, and we believe this presentation, when considered with the GAAP presentation, provides supplemental information useful for investors in evaluating our investment portfolio and financial condition. See Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of investments in debt and equity of affiliates and TBAs.\nNet interest margin and leverage ratio\nOur GAAP net interest margin is calculated by subtracting the weighted average cost of funds on our GAAP investment portfolio from the weighted average yield for our GAAP investment portfolio, which excludes cash held by us and any net TBA position. Both elements of cost of funds on our GAAP investment portfolio are weighted by the outstanding financing arrangements on our GAAP investment portfolio, securitized debt, and loan participation payable at quarter end, exclusive of repurchase agreements associated with U.S. Treasury securities, if any.\nNet interest margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by subtracting the weighted average cost of funds from the weighted average yield for our investment portfolio, which excludes cash held by us and any net TBA position. The weighted average yield on our Agency RMBS portfolio and our credit portfolio represents an effective interest rate, which utilizes all estimates of future cash flows and adjusts for actual prepayment and cash flow activity as of year-end. The weighted average yield on our SFR portfolio represents annualized fourth quarter net operating income divided by the carrying value of our SFR portfolio gross of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Net operating income on our SFR portfolio is comprised of rental income and other SFR related income less property operating and maintenance expenses and property management fees. The calculation of weighted average yield is weighted on net carrying value. The weighted average cost of funds is the sum of the weighted average funding costs on total financing outstanding at year-end and our weighted average hedging cost, which is the weighted average of the net pay rate on our interest rate swaps, the net receive/pay rate on our Treasury long and short positions, respectively, and the net receivable rate on our IO index derivatives, if any. Both elements of cost of funds are weighted by the outstanding financing arrangements on our investment portfolio, securitized debt, and loan participation payable at year-end, exclusive of repurchase agreements associated with U.S. Treasury securities.\nNet interest margin and leverage ratio can be used to calculate the return on equity of our investment portfolio and Management believes that these metrics should be considered together when evaluating the performance of our investment portfolio. See the \"Financing activities\" section below for more detail on our leverage ratio.\nThe chart below sets forth the net interest margin and leverage ratio from our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and a reconciliation to our GAAP investment portfolio:\n\n\n\n*Yield of 4.11% on SFR portfolio is based on its annualized fourth quarter net operating income divided by its carrying value, gross of accumulated depreciation and amortization.\n**Excludes any net TBA position.\n***Refer to the \"Financing activities\" section below for an aggregate breakout of leverage.\nCore Earnings\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2018, we determined that we should modify our definition and calculation of Core Earnings,\u201d a non-GAAP financial measure, to exclude realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of Arc Home's net mortgage servicing rights as well as realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivatives that are intended to offset changes in the fair value of those net mortgage servicing rights held at Arc Home, our subsidiary licensed mortgage originator. The modification to our definition and calculation of Core Earnings is consistent with our treatment of excluding realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of Excess MSRs held directly by us.\nWe define Core Earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as Net Income/(loss) available to common stockholders excluding (i) unrealized gains/(losses) on securities, loans, derivatives and other investments and realized gains/(losses) on the sale or termination of such instruments, (ii) beginning with Q2 2018, as a policy change, any transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of our investments, (iii) beginning with Q3 2018, concurrent with a change in our business, any depreciation or amortization expense related to our SFR portfolio, (iv) beginning with Q3 2018, as a policy change, accrued deal related performance fees payable to Arc Home and third party operators to the extent the primary component of the accrual relates to items that are excluded from Core Earnings, such as unrealized and realized gains/(losses), and (v) beginning with Q4 2018 and applied retrospectively, as a policy change, realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of Arc Home's net mortgage servicing rights as well as realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivatives that are intended to offset changes in the fair value of those net mortgage servicing rights. Items (i) through (v) above include any amounts related to those items held in affiliated entities. Management considers the transaction related expenses referenced in (ii) above to be similar to realized losses incurred at acquisition or disposition and does not view them as being part of its core operations. Management views the exclusion described in (v) above to be consistent with how it calculates Core Earnings on the remainder of its portfolio. As defined, Core Earnings include the net interest income and other income earned on our investments on a yield adjusted basis, including TBA dollar roll income or any other investment activity that may earn or pay net interest or its economic equivalent. One of our objectives is to generate net income from net interest margin on the portfolio, and management uses Core Earnings to help measure this objective. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure, when considered with its GAAP financials, provides supplemental information useful for investors as it enables them to evaluate our current core performance using the same measure that management uses to operate the business. This metric, in conjunction with related GAAP measures, provides greater transparency into the information used by our management team in its financial and operational decision-making. Our presentation of Core Earnings may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies, who may use different calculations. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our GAAP financial results and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Refer to the \"Results of Operations\" section above for a detailed discussion of our GAAP financial results.\nA reconciliation of Net Income/(loss) available to common stockholders to Core Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 is set forth below (in thousands, except per share data):\n\n (a) For the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, $0.5 million or $0.02 per share, $1.1 million or $0.04 per share, and $0.4 million or $0.02 per share, respectively, of realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of Arc Home's net mortgage servicing rights and corresponding derivatives were excluded from Core Earnings per diluted share as a result of our modification to the definition and calculation of Core Earnings in Q4 2018. The $0.5 million or $0.02 per share for the year ended December 31, 2018 was comprised of $1.3 million or $0.05 per share, $0.8 million or $0.03 per share, $1.0 million or $0.03 per share, and $(2.6) million or $(0.09) per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018, June 30, 2018, September 30, 2018, and December 31, 2018, respectively. \n (b) For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the above chart was not adjusted for transaction related expenses of $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, as they did not have a material impact on Core Earnings for the periods. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the above chart was not adjusted for transaction related expenses of $0.1 million as they did not have a material impact on Core Earnings for that period. Our policy with respect to transaction related expenses was modified in Q2 2018. \n (c) For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the above chart was not adjusted for deal related performance fees of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, as they did not have a material impact on Core Earnings for the periods. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the above chart was not adjusted for deal related performance fees as they did not have a material impact on Core Earnings for that period. Our policy with respect to deal related performance fees was modified in Q3 2018. \nInvestment activities\nWe opportunistically invest in a diversified risk-adjusted portfolio of Agency RMBS, Credit Investments, and Single-Family Rental Properties. Our Credit Investments include our Residential Investments, Commercial Investments, and ABS Investments.\nThe risk-reward profile of our investment opportunities changes continuously with the market, with labor, housing and economic fundamentals, and with U.S. monetary policy, among others. As a result, in reacting to market conditions and taking into account a variety of other factors, including liquidity, duration, interest rate expectations and hedging, the mix of our assets changes over time as we opportunistically deploy capital.\nWe evaluate investments in Agency RMBS using factors including expected future prepayment trends, supply of and demand for Agency RMBS, costs of financing, costs of hedging, expected future interest rate volatility and the overall shape of the U.S. Treasury and interest rate swap yield curves. Prepayment speeds, as reflected by the CPR, and interest rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. In general, as prepayment speeds on our Agency RMBS portfolio increase, the related purchase premium amortization increases, thereby reducing the net yield on such assets.\nOur credit investments are subject to risk of loss with regard to principal and interest payments. We evaluate each investment in our credit portfolio based on the characteristics of the underlying collateral and the securitization structure. We maintain a comprehensive portfolio management process that generally includes day-to-day oversight by the portfolio management team and a quarterly credit review process for each investment that examines the need for a potential reduction in accretable yield, missed or late contractual payments, significant declines in collateral performance, prepayments, projected defaults, loss severities and other data which may indicate a potential issue in our ability to recover our capital from the investment. These processes are designed to enable our Manager to evaluate and proactively manage asset-specific credit issues and identify credit trends on a portfolio-wide basis. Nevertheless, we cannot be certain that our review will identify all issues within our portfolio due to, among other things, adverse economic conditions or events adversely affecting specific assets. Therefore, potential future losses may also stem from issues with our investments that are not identified by our credit reviews.\nOur SFR portfolio is comprised of 1,225 properties located predominantly in the Southeast United States. The values of these properties are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to: national, regional and local economic conditions, local real estate conditions, construction quality, age, and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar codes.\nThe following table presents a detailed break-down of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 and a reconciliation to our GAAP Investment Portfolio (in thousands):\n\n (a) Carrying value represents fair value, except in the case of Single-family rental properties, which represents cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. \n (b) The leverage ratio on Agency RMBS includes any net receivables on TBA. The leverage ratio by type of investment is calculated by dividing the investment type's total financing by its allocated equity (described in the chart below). \n (c) Net of any non-recourse securitized debt, as applicable. \n (d) Refer to the \"Financing activities\" section below for an aggregate breakout of leverage. During Q3 2018, the Company transferred certain of its CMBS from a non-wholly owned subsidiaries to a consolidated entity, resulting in those investments being reflected in the \"Commercial Investments\" line item of this chart and not in the \"Investments in Debt and Equity of Affiliates\" line item. \nThe following table presents a summary of the allocated equity of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\n\nWe allocate our equity by investment using the fair market value of our investment portfolio, less any associated leverage, inclusive of any long TBA position (at cost). We allocate all non-investment portfolio related items based on their respective characteristics in order to sum to stockholders' equity per the consolidated balance sheets. Our equity allocation method is a non-GAAP methodology and may not be comparable to the similarly titled measure or concepts of other companies, who may use different calculations and allocation methodologies.\nSecurities and Loans Segment\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our Securities and Loans Segment to our GAAP Securities and Loans Segment as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\n\n (1) Included in Agency RMBS, Residential Investments and Commercial Investments are $0.9 million fair market value, $207.4 million fair market value and $5.1 million fair market value, respectively, net of any non-recourse securitized debt, that are included in the \"Investments in debt and equity of affiliates\" line item on our consolidated balance sheet. These items, inclusive of our investment in AG Arc and other items, net to $84.9 million which is included in the \"Investments in debt and equity of affiliates\" line item on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of investments in debt and equity of affiliates. \n (2) Equity residuals, principal only securities and Excess MSRs with a zero coupon rate are excluded from this calculation. \n (3) This is based on projected life. Typically, actual maturities of investments and loans are shorter than stated contractual maturities. Maturities are affected by the contractual lives of the underlying mortgages, periodic payments of principal and prepayments of principal. \n (4) Excess MSRs whose underlying collateral is securitized in a trust held by a U.S. government agency or GSE. \n (5) Non-Agency RMBS with credit scores above 700, between 700 and 620 and below 620 at origination are classified as Prime, Alt-A, and Subprime, respectively. The weighted average credit scores of our Prime and Alt-A/Subprime Non-Agency RMBS were 719 and 665, respectively. \n (6) Excess MSRs whose underlying collateral is securitized in a trust not held by a U.S. government agency or GSE. \n (7) Includes Freddie Mac K-Series interest-only bonds. \nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our Securities and Loans Segment to our GAAP Securities and Loans Segment as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in this report.\nOur company\nWe are a hybrid mortgage REIT that opportunistically invests in a diversified risk-adjusted portfolio of Agency RMBS, Credit Investments and Single-Family Rental Properties. Our Credit Investments include our Residential Investments, Commercial Investments, and ABS Investments. We are a Maryland corporation and are externally managed by our Manager, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Angelo Gordon, pursuant to a management agreement. Our Manager, pursuant to a delegation agreement dated as of June 29, 2011, has delegated to Angelo Gordon the overall responsibility of its day-to-day duties and obligations arising under the management agreement. We conduct our operations to qualify and be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders as long as we maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. We also operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, under the symbol MITT. Our 8.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and our 8.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock trade on the NYSE under the symbols MITT-PA and MITT-PB, respectively.\nMarket conditions\nIncluding distressed sales, home prices nationwide increased by 5.1% on a year-over-year basis in November 2018 as compared with November 2017, according to data released by CoreLogic. This marks the 82nd consecutive monthly increase year-over-year in national home prices. According to CoreLogic's Homeowner Equity Report, in the third quarter of 2018, U.S. homeowners with mortgages have seen their equity increase by a total of nearly $775 billion since the third quarter of 2017. In the third quarter of 2018, as compared to the third quarter of 2017, the total number of mortgaged residential properties with negative equity (homes where the homeowner owes more on the home than the home is worth) decreased to 2.2 million homes from 2.6 million homes.\nHome prices have benefited from a tight supply of homes across the nation, and the negative equity epidemic has eased due to the rise in home prices over the past several years. Additionally, credit performance in terms of serious delinquencies and subsequent default rates continued to be stable-to-improving in 2018, as mortgage delinquency rates reported by the Federal Reserve declined from 3.6% to 2.8% from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018. This improvement has been driven by the strengthening of borrower's household balance sheets and unemployment remaining low.\nDuring the year, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds interest rate four times, with the most recent raise during the December meeting where the Fed raised the federal funds interest rate by 0.25% to a target range of 2.25%-2.50%. The labor market continued its expansion in 2018, as the rate of unemployment remained well below 5% during the year and inflation has improved to levels close to the Fed's 2.0% target for core PCE. In the December update of the Fed's Summary of Economic Projections, the median forecast for real GDP growth decreased in 2018 and 2019 and remained the same for 2020, while the median forecast for the unemployment rate remained the same for 2018 and 2019 and increased in 2020. The projection of the median Fed Funds rates, based on the individual assessments of the FOMC members, was 2.4% in 2018, 2.9% in 2019 and 3.1% in 2020.\nThe interest rate environment experienced volatility in 2018, as rates moved higher in concert with expectations for federal funds rate increases and then reversed course during the fourth quarter, falling sharply partially due to uncertainty related to the path of the economy in 2019. Agency mortgages underperformed for 2018, with nearly all the underperformance occurring in the fourth quarter. Agency RMBS spreads widened as interest rates declined, which primarily drove the decrease in MITT's book value for the year. During the fourth quarter, legacy RMBS spreads were wider but exhibited strong technical demand and favorable underlying fundamentals. The CRT market widened in sympathy with broader risk markets during the fourth quarter, with the widening most pronounced in the lower part of the capital structure. Despite this backdrop, there was little forced selling from CRT investors during the quarter.\nThe market conditions and trends outlined above may have a meaningful impact on our operating results and our existing portfolio and may cause us to adjust our investment and financing strategies over time as new opportunities emerge and the risk profile of our business changes.\nRecent government activity\nThe current regulatory environment may be impacted by future legislative developments, such as amendments to key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act or changes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including with respect to how long they will continue to be in existence, the extent of their roles in the market and what forms they will take. There is a lack of clarity around the impact of such potential reform on our operations.\nResults of operations\nOur operating results can be affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on the size and composition of our investment portfolio, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, our target assets in the marketplace, which can be impacted by unanticipated credit events, such as defaults, liquidations or delinquencies, experienced by borrowers whose mortgage loans are included in our investment portfolio. Our primary source of net income available to common stockholders is our net interest income, less our cost of hedging, which represents the difference between the interest earned on our investment portfolio and the costs of financing and hedging our investment portfolio. Our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates, prepayment speeds, as measured by the Constant Prepayment Rate (\"CPR\") on the Agency RMBS in our investment portfolio, and our funding and hedging costs.\nThe table below presents certain information from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and

million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $(11.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to lower prices on our securities and derivatives and other investments, which decreased our \"Unrealized gain/(loss) on real estate securities and loans, net,\" our \"Unrealized gain/(loss) on derivative and other instruments, net\", and our \"Net realized gain/(loss).\" Net income/(loss) available to common stockholders increased $54.9 million from $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $105.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to higher prices on our securities, which increased our \"Unrealized gain/(loss) on real estate securities and loans, net,\" coupled with higher derivative prices, which increased our \"Unrealized gain/(loss) on derivative and other instruments, net.\"\nInterest income\nInterest income is calculated using the effective interest method for our GAAP investment portfolio excluding SFR and calculated based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principal balance on our U.S. Treasury securities, if any.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nInterest income increased by $27.7 million from $128.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $156.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost of our GAAP investment portfolio (excluding SFR) and U.S. Treasury securities, if any, period over period by $0.4 billion from $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was coupled with an increase in the weighted average yield on our GAAP investment portfolio (excluding SFR) and U.S. Treasury securities, if any, during the period of 0.35% from 4.45% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 4.80% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nInterest income increased by $5.8 million from $123.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $128.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost of our GAAP investment portfolio (excluding SFR) and U.S. Treasury securities, if any, period over period by $0.1 billion from $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017.

This was coupled with an increase in the weighted average financing balance on our GAAP investment portfolio and U.S. Treasury securities, if any, of $0.5 billion from $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. Refer to the \"Financing activities\" section below for a discussion of material changes in our cost of funds.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nInterest expense increased by $9.9 million from $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in the weighted average financing rate on our GAAP investment portfolio and U.S. Treasury securities, if any, during the period, by 0.39% from 1.47% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 1.86% for the year ended December 31, 2017.

This metric allows management to consider the investment portfolio exclusive of non-cash adjustments and facilitates the comparison of our financial performance to peer REITs. A reconciliation of book value per share to undepreciated book value per share as of December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 is presented below.\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book value per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back: Accumulated depreciation and amortization per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Undepreciated book value per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPer share amounts for book value are calculated using all outstanding common shares in accordance with GAAP, including all shares granted to AG REIT Management, LLC, our external manager, and our independent directors under our equity incentive plans as of quarter-end. Book value is calculated using stockholders' equity less net proceeds of the Company's 8.25% Series A and 8.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock as the numerator.\nPresentation of investment, financing and hedging activities\nIn the \"Investment activities,\" \"Financing activities,\" \"Hedging activities\" and \"Liquidity and capital resources\" sections of this Part II, Item 7, where we disclose our investment portfolio and the related financing arrangements, we have presented this information inclusive of (i) unconsolidated ownership interests in affiliates that are accounted for under GAAP using the equity method and (ii) TBAs, which are accounted for as derivatives under GAAP. Our investment portfolio and the related financing arrangements are presented along with a reconciliation to GAAP. This presentation of our investment portfolio is consistent with how our management evaluates the business, and we believe this presentation, when considered with the GAAP presentation, provides supplemental information useful for investors in evaluating our investment portfolio and financial condition. See Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of investments in debt and equity of affiliates and TBAs.\nNet interest margin and leverage ratio\nOur GAAP net interest margin is calculated by subtracting the weighted average cost of funds on our GAAP investment portfolio from the weighted average yield for our GAAP investment portfolio, which excludes cash held by us and any net TBA position. Both elements of cost of funds on our GAAP investment portfolio are weighted by the outstanding financing arrangements on our GAAP investment portfolio, securitized debt, and loan participation payable at quarter end, exclusive of repurchase agreements associated with U.S. Treasury securities, if any.\nNet interest margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by subtracting the weighted average cost of funds from the weighted average yield for our investment portfolio, which excludes cash held by us and any net TBA position. The weighted average yield on our Agency RMBS portfolio and our credit portfolio represents an effective interest rate, which utilizes all estimates of future cash flows and adjusts for actual prepayment and cash flow activity as of year-end. The weighted average yield on our SFR portfolio represents annualized fourth quarter net operating income divided by the carrying value of our SFR portfolio gross of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Net operating income on our SFR portfolio is comprised of rental income and other SFR related income less property operating and maintenance expenses and property management fees. The calculation of weighted average yield is weighted on net carrying value. The weighted average cost of funds is the sum of the weighted average funding costs on total financing outstanding at year-end and our weighted average hedging cost, which is the weighted average of the net pay rate on our interest rate swaps, the net receive/pay rate on our Treasury long and short positions, respectively, and the net receivable rate on our IO index derivatives, if any. Both elements of cost of funds are weighted by the outstanding financing arrangements on our investment portfolio, securitized debt, and loan participation payable at year-end, exclusive of repurchase agreements associated with U.S. Treasury securities.\nNet interest margin and leverage ratio can be used to calculate the return on equity of our investment portfolio and Management believes that these metrics should be considered together when evaluating the performance of our investment portfolio. See the \"Financing activities\" section below for more detail on our leverage ratio.\nThe chart below sets forth the net interest margin and leverage ratio from our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and a reconciliation to our GAAP investment portfolio:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

leverage.\nCore Earnings\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2018, we determined that we should modify our definition and calculation of Core Earnings,\u201d a non-GAAP financial measure, to exclude realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of Arc Home's net mortgage servicing rights as well as realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivatives that are intended to offset changes in the fair value of those net mortgage servicing rights held at Arc Home, our subsidiary licensed mortgage originator. The modification to our definition and calculation of Core Earnings is consistent with our treatment of excluding realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of Excess MSRs held directly by us.\nWe define Core Earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as Net Income/(loss) available to common stockholders excluding (i) unrealized gains/(losses) on securities, loans, derivatives and other investments and realized gains/(losses) on the sale or termination of such instruments, (ii) beginning with Q2 2018, as a policy change, any transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of our investments, (iii) beginning with Q3 2018, concurrent with a change in our business, any depreciation or amortization expense related to our SFR portfolio, (iv) beginning with Q3 2018, as a policy change, accrued deal related performance fees payable to Arc Home and third party operators to the extent the primary component of the accrual relates to items that are excluded from Core Earnings, such as unrealized and realized gains/(losses), and (v) beginning with Q4 2018 and applied retrospectively, as a policy change, realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of Arc Home's net mortgage servicing rights as well as realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivatives that are intended to offset changes in the fair value of those net mortgage servicing rights. Items (i) through (v) above include any amounts related to those items held in affiliated entities. Management considers the transaction related expenses referenced in (ii) above to be similar to realized losses incurred at acquisition or disposition and does not view them as being part of its core operations. Management views the exclusion described in (v) above to be consistent with how it calculates Core Earnings on the remainder of its portfolio. As defined, Core Earnings include the net interest income and other income earned on our investments on a yield adjusted basis, including TBA dollar roll income or any other investment activity that may earn or pay net interest or its economic equivalent. One of our objectives is to generate net income from net interest margin on the portfolio, and management uses Core Earnings to help measure this objective. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure, when considered with its GAAP financials, provides supplemental information useful for investors as it enables them to evaluate our current core performance using the same measure that management uses to operate the business. This metric, in conjunction with related GAAP measures, provides greater transparency into the information used by our management team in its financial and operational decision-making. Our presentation of Core Earnings may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies, who may use different calculations. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our GAAP financial results and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Refer to the \"Results of Operations\" section above for a detailed discussion of our GAAP financial results.\nA reconciliation of Net Income/(loss) available to common stockholders to Core Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 is set forth below (in thousands, except per share data):\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income/(loss) available to common stockholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,901\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add (Deduct):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized (gain)/loss\n</td> <td>39,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar roll income\n</td> <td>1,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in (earnings)/loss from affiliates\n</td> <td>(15,593\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,622\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,519\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income and expenses from equity method investments (a)\n</td> <td>6,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction related expenses and deal related performance fees (b)(c)\n</td> <td>2,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>2,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>(122\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized (gain)/loss on real estate securities and loans, net\n</td> <td>20,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45,529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,673\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized (gain)/loss on derivative and other instruments, net\n</td> <td>13,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,813\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,613\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core Earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core Earnings, per Diluted Share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) For the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, $0.5 million or $0.02 per share, $1.1 million or $0.04 per share, and $0.4 million or $0.02 per share, respectively, of realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of Arc Home's net mortgage servicing rights and corresponding derivatives were excluded from Core Earnings per diluted share as a result of our modification to the definition and calculation of Core Earnings in Q4 2018.

For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the above chart was not adjusted for transaction related expenses of $0.1 million as they did not have a material impact on Core Earnings for that period.

For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the above chart was not adjusted for deal related performance fees as they did not have a material impact on Core Earnings for that period. Our policy with respect to deal related performance fees was modified in Q3 2018. \nInvestment activities\nWe opportunistically invest in a diversified risk-adjusted portfolio of Agency RMBS, Credit Investments, and Single-Family Rental Properties. Our Credit Investments include our Residential Investments, Commercial Investments, and ABS Investments.\nThe risk-reward profile of our investment opportunities changes continuously with the market, with labor, housing and economic fundamentals, and with U.S. monetary policy, among others. As a result, in reacting to market conditions and taking into account a variety of other factors, including liquidity, duration, interest rate expectations and hedging, the mix of our assets changes over time as we opportunistically deploy capital.\nWe evaluate investments in Agency RMBS using factors including expected future prepayment trends, supply of and demand for Agency RMBS, costs of financing, costs of hedging, expected future interest rate volatility and the overall shape of the U.S. Treasury and interest rate swap yield curves. Prepayment speeds, as reflected by the CPR, and interest rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. In general, as prepayment speeds on our Agency RMBS portfolio increase, the related purchase premium amortization increases, thereby reducing the net yield on such assets.\nOur credit investments are subject to risk of loss with regard to principal and interest payments. We evaluate each investment in our credit portfolio based on the characteristics of the underlying collateral and the securitization structure. We maintain a comprehensive portfolio management process that generally includes day-to-day oversight by the portfolio management team and a quarterly credit review process for each investment that examines the need for a potential reduction in accretable yield, missed or late contractual payments, significant declines in collateral performance, prepayments, projected defaults, loss severities and other data which may indicate a potential issue in our ability to recover our capital from the investment. These processes are designed to enable our Manager to evaluate and proactively manage asset-specific credit issues and identify credit trends on a portfolio-wide basis. Nevertheless, we cannot be certain that our review will identify all issues within our portfolio due to, among other things, adverse economic conditions or events adversely affecting specific assets. Therefore, potential future losses may also stem from issues with our investments that are not identified by our credit reviews.\nOur SFR portfolio is comprised of 1,225 properties located predominantly in the Southeast United States. The values of these properties are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to: national, regional and local economic conditions, local real estate conditions, construction quality, age, and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar codes.\nThe following table presents a detailed break-down of our
