MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d), including discussions of our product development plans, business strategies and market factors influencing our results, may include forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those anticipated by us as a result of various factors, both foreseen and unforeseen, including, but not limited to, our ability to continue to develop new products and increase systems sales in markets characterized by rapid technological evolution, consolidation and competition from larger, better-capitalized competitors. Many other economic, competitive, governmental and technological factors could affect our ability to achieve our goals and interested persons are urged to review any risks that may be described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d as set forth herein, as well as in our other public disclosures and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\nThis MD&A is provided as a supplement to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\"Report\") in order to enhance your understanding of our results of operations and financial condition and should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report. Historical results of operations, percentage margin fluctuations and any trends that may be inferred from the discussion below are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period.\nCompany Overview\nNextGen Healthcare is a leading provider of ambulatory-focused healthcare software and services solutions. In pursuit of our mission to empower the transformation of ambulatory care, we provide innovative technology-based solutions that help our clients succeed while they are managing more complexity and assuming greater financial risk.\nOur clients span the ambulatory care market from small single specialty practices to larger multi-specialty organizations. We have fully integrated our solutions so that our clients are able to provide their patients with comprehensive services utilizing a single platform. Our highly interoperable platform allows ambulatory practices to thrive especially in complex, heterogeneous healthcare communities where frictionless clinical data exchange is required to coordinate and optimize patient care.\nNextGen Healthcare has historically enhanced our solutions through both organic and inorganic activities. In October 2015, we divested our former Hospital Solutions division to focus exclusively on the ambulatory marketplace. In January 2016, we acquired HealthFusion Holdings, Inc. and its cloud-based electronic health record and practice management solution. In April 2017, we acquired Entrada, Inc. and its cloud-based, mobile platform for clinical documentation and collaboration. In August 2017, we acquired EagleDream Health, Inc. and its cloud-based population health analytics solution. In January 2018, we acquired Inforth Technologies for its specialty-focused clinical content. The integration of these acquired technologies have made NextGen Healthcare's solutions among the most comprehensive and powerful in the market.\nThe Company was incorporated in California in 1974. Previously named Quality Systems, Inc., the Company changed its corporate name to NextGen Healthcare, Inc. in September 2018. Our principal offices are located at 18111 Von Karman Ave., Suite 800, Irvine, California, 92612, and our principal website is www.nextgen.com. We operate on a fiscal year ending on March 31.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies and update our assumptions, estimates, and judgments, as needed, to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. To the extent that there are material differences between our estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected.\nOur significant accounting policies, as described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report, should be read in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results because application of such policies require significant judgment regarding the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and that affect our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 ( ASC 606\u201d) and all related amendments as of April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. ASC 606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605\u201d), and requires entities to recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Refer to Note 3, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies under ASC 606.\nReserves on Accounts Receivable\nWe maintain reserves for potential sales returns and uncollectible accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are reported net of uncollectible accounts receivable our consolidated balance sheets. Subsequent to the adoption of ASC 606 as of April 1, 2018, sales return reserves are classified as other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nOur standard contracts generally do not contain provisions for clients to return products or services. However, we historically have accepted sales returns under certain circumstances. Accordingly, we estimate sales return reserves, including reserves for returns and other credits, based upon our review of customer-specific facts and circumstances, including aged receivable balances, and recognize revenue, net of an allowance for sales returns. If we are unable to estimate the returns, revenue recognition may be delayed until the rights of return period lapses, provided also, that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. If we experience changes in practices related to sales returns or changes in actual return rates that deviate from the historical data on which our reserves had been established, our revenues may be adversely affected.\nAllowances for doubtful accounts and other uncollectible accounts receivable related to estimated losses resulting from our clients' inability to make required payments are established based on our historical experience of bad debt expense and the aging of our accounts receivable balances, net of deferred revenue and specifically reserved accounts. Specific reserves are based on our estimate of the probability of collection for certain troubled accounts. Accounts are written off as uncollectible only after we have expended extensive collection efforts.\nOur allowances for doubtful accounts are based on our assessment of the collectability of client accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the client receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a client's ability to pay and review of major third-party credit-rating agencies, as needed. If a major client's creditworthiness or financial condition were to deteriorate, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nAlthough we currently believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in required reserves that could be material.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs, consisting primarily of employee salaries and benefits and certain third party costs, incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products for external sale are expensed as incurred, and reported as net research and development costs in the consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income, until technological feasibility has been established. After technological feasibility is established, any additional external software development costs are capitalized. Amortization of capitalized software is recorded using the greater of the ratio of current revenues to the total of current and expected revenues of the related product or the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the related product, which is typically three years. The total of capitalized software costs incurred in the development of products for external sale are reported as capitalized software costs within our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe also incur costs to develop software applications for our internal-use and costs for the development of software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") based products sold to our clients. The development costs of our SaaS-based products are considered internal-use for accounting purposes. Our internal-use capitalized costs are stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is typically three years. Application development stage costs generally include costs associated with internal-use software configuration, coding, installation and testing. Costs related to the preliminary project stage and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Costs of significant upgrades and enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized, whereas costs incurred for maintenance and minor\nupgrades and enhancements are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software costs for developing SaaS-based products are reported as capitalized software costs within our consolidated balance sheets and capitalized software costs for developing our internal-use software applications are reported as equipment and improvements within our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe periodically reassess the estimated economic life and the recoverability of our capitalized software costs. If a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated net cash flows to be generated from sales of the applicable software product, the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs of a software product exceed the net realizable value is written off as a charge to earnings. The net realizable value is the estimated future gross revenues from that product reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product, including the costs of performing maintenance and client support required to satisfy our responsibility at the time of sale. In addition to the assessment of net realizable value, we routinely review and adjust, if necessary, the remaining estimated lives of our capitalized software costs. Additionally, we perform a periodic review of our clients' usage of our software products and dispose of fully amortized capitalized software costs after such products are determined to be no longer used by our clients.\nAlthough we currently believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe completed our acquisitions of Entrada, EagleDream and Inforth during the year ended March 31, 2018, all of which were accounted for as purchase business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting.\nIn accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, we allocated the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, including, but not limited to, intangible assets, goodwill, and contingent consideration liabilities. We estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses depending on the nature of the assets being sold. We estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities based on our projection of expected results, as needed. The process for estimating fair values in many cases requires the use of significant estimates, assumptions and judgments, including determining the timing and estimates of future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. We expect to finalize the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable within the measurement period, but not later than one year following the acquisition date. Any adjustments to fair value subsequent to the measurement period are reflected in the consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income.\nThe purchase price allocations of the Entrada, EagleDream and Inforth acquisitions are considered final.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination is measured as the excess of the purchase price, or consideration transferred, over the net acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized as it has been determined to have an indefinite useful life.\nAs part of our annual goodwill impairment test, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we conduct a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their carrying values. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually during our first fiscal quarter, referred to as the annual test date. Based on our qualitative assessment for the current fiscal year, we have determined that there was no impairment to our goodwill as of June 30, 2018. We will also test for impairment between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. We currently also do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will\nbe a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to future impairment charges that could be material.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of trade names and contracts, customer relationships, and software technology, all of which arose in connection with our acquisitions.\nThese intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are stated net of accumulated amortization. We currently amortize intangible assets using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed.\nAlthough currently we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to decreases in the fair value of our intangible assets, resulting in impairment charges that could be material. We test intangible assets for impairment if we believe indicators of impairment exist.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe record share-based compensation related to our employee stock options plans, employee share purchase plans, restricted stock awards, and restricted performance stock awards and shares. See Note 13, Share-Based Awards,\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for a complete discussion of our stock-based compensation plans.\nShare-based compensation expense associated with the stock options under our equity incentive plans is based on the number of options that ultimately vest and adjusted, if needed, as forfeitures occur. We estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model based on required inputs, including expected term, volatility, risk-free rate, and expected dividend yield. Expected term is estimated based upon the historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and therefore the proportion of awards that is expected to vest. Volatility is estimated by using the weighted-average historical volatility of our common stock, which approximates expected volatility. The risk-free rate is the implied yield available on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms equal to the expected term. The expected dividend yield is the average dividend rate during a period equal to the expected term of the option. The fair value vest is recognized ratably as expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income.\nShare-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards is estimated using the market price of the common stock on the date of grant. Share-based compensation expense associated with the restricted performance stock awards and shares is based on the grant date fair value measured at the underlying closing share price on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo-based valuation model.\nWe currently do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine share-based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in share-based compensation expense that could be material.\nTrends and Events in Our Business\nWe believe that the trends and events described below have contributed to our consolidated results of operations and may continue to impact our future results.\nOver the last decade, the ambulatory healthcare market has experienced significant regulatory change, which has driven practice transformation and technology advancements. Recognizing that it was imperative to digitize the American health system to stem the escalating cost of healthcare and improve the quality of care being delivered, Congress enacted the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act in 2009 ( HITECH Act\u201d). The legislation stimulated healthcare organizations to not only adopt electronic health records, but to use them to collect discrete data that could be used to drive quality care. This standardization supported early pay for reporting and pay-for-performance programs.\nIn 2010, the Affordable Care Act ( ACA\u201d) established the roadmap for shifting American healthcare from volume (fee-for-service) to a value-based care ( VBC\u201d) system that rewards improved outcomes at lower costs (fee-for-value). This was followed by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 ( MACRA\u201d), bipartisan legislation that further changed the way Medicare rewards clinicians for value vs. volume. Initially focused on government-funded care, the domain of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d), these programs are now firmly established on the commercial insurance side of the industry as well.\nVBC created the need for a new category of healthcare information technology ( HIT\u201d) tools that could be used to identify and treat groups of patients, or cohorts, based on risk. Population Health Management ( PHM\u201d) tools support these needs by identifying patient risk, engaging patients, coordinating care, and determining when interventions are needed to improve clinical and financial outcomes. The United States PHM market was estimated at $3.1 billion in 2018 and is expected to more than double by 2022.\nImportantly, the introduction of VBC programs was only an element of the broader approach to reducing healthcare expenditure. It was also accompanied by significant reductions in Medicare spending with a projected reduction of $218 billion in payments by 2028, as reported by RevCycle Intelligence. The drive to reduce costs initially led to consolidation in the healthcare system that was followed by a significant shift of care from the inpatient to the outpatient setting as more care is being moved to this lower cost environment. Ambulatory care settings have become an essential component of comprehensive, low cost distributed care. In 2018, outpatient volumes reached over 3.5 billion encounters and are forecasted to grow 15% by 2028, as reported by Becker's Health IT and CIO Report. The independent physicians' practices segment is expected to generate more revenue than non-affiliated hospitals as it accepts electronic health records integrated PHM programs for better primary and follow-up care, as reported by Frost & Sullivan. The need to sustain revenue has made it extremely important for practices to secure their patient market share, elevating patient loyalty to be a significant determinant of provider success. Capturing patient market share and thriving in a market driven by VBC requires both an integrated platform and a full view of the patient population's clinical and cost data neither of which could be accomplished without new technologies to collect and analyze multi-sourced patient data. Effectively implemented, these new technologies allow organizations to enhance financial viability while exercising the freedom to join, affiliate, integrate or interoperate in ways that maximize strategic control.\nIn order to maintain financial success with shifting reimbursement rules and shrinking reimbursement, we believe demand for managed services, including revenue cycle management services ( RCMS\u201d), hosting, transcription and scribe services, aligned and integrated with clinical technology solutions, will increase in the coming years.\nBased on these trends, successful clients must undertake the following imperatives: 1) ensure healthy predictable financial outcomes, 2) provide high quality care at a lower cost in a risk-bearing environment, 3) ensure engaged and loyal patients, and 4) optimize clinician productivity while deploying HIT solutions, 5) support frictionless interoperability.\nOur core strategy is to become a trusted partner to our clients as they embark on their value-based journey and begin to take on risk as part of value-based contracts. We understand that our clients are now faced with a more complex, rapidly changing practice environment and that the HIT solutions that support these endeavors must evolve to meet these challenging requirements. Providing our clients with a comprehensive multi-faceted platform and accompanying services to enable their success is the key to our strategy.\nBased on current market trends, our strategic priorities are:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Focus on Ambulatory Care.

</tr>\n</table>\nWe generate revenue from sales of licensing rights and subscriptions to our software solutions, hardware and third-party software products, support and maintenance, managed services (formerly referred to as revenue cycle management and related services), electronic data interchange and data services ( EDI\u201d), and other non-recurring services, including implementation, training, and consulting services performed for clients who use our products.\nConsolidated revenue for the year ended March 31, 2019 decreased $1.8 million compared to the prior year due to a $2.3 million decrease in recurring revenues, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in software, hardware and other non-recurring revenues. The decrease in recurring revenues was due to $15.1 million lower managed services revenue and $3.0 million lower support and maintenance revenue, partially offset by $11.2 million higher subscriptions and $4.6 million higher EDI services revenue. A decrease of approximately $12.5 million in managed services is attributed to the adoption of ASC 606, whereby a portion of service fees associated with revenue cycle management ( RCM\u201d) arrangements are now classified within other revenue categories, such as subscription services, support and maintenance, and software license and hardware. Managed services revenue further decreased compared to the prior year due to higher levels of client attrition experienced in recent periods. The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in $7.5 million higher subscription services revenue and $5.3 million higher support and maintenance revenue, which were partially offset by lower revenue due to higher client attrition during the year. EDI revenue increased due to higher EDI services sold with our NextGen Office cloud-based solutions and growth in EDI transaction volume due to the addition of new clients and further penetration of our existing client base as well as incremental revenues earned from the sales of certain clinical data. Total software, hardware, and other non-recurring revenue increased approximately $1.4 million due to the adoption of ASC 606, partially offset by $1.0 million lower revenue based on lower demand from our clients for our software products and related implementation services.\nConsolidated revenue for the year ended March 31, 2018 increased $21.4 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2017, due to a $27.9 million increase in recurring revenues, offset by a $6.5 million decrease in non-recurring revenues. The increase in recurring revenues was due to a $12.2 million increase in subscription services, $6.9 million increase in managed services revenue, $5.0 million increase in support and maintenance, and $3.8 million increase in EDI revenue. Subscription revenues increased due to higher sales of our NextGen Office cloud-based subscriptions, and incremental sales of our NextGen Mobile and NextGen Population Health cloud-based solutions acquired from Entrada in April 2017 and EagleDream in August 2017, respectively. Managed services revenue benefit from higher RCM services revenue from the addition of new clients and organic growth achieved through cross selling and ramping up of RCM services provided to our existing clients, which was offset by customer attrition as well as higher sales of our hosting services. The increase in support and maintenance is primarily due to lower sales credits in the current year, addition of new customers, and the impact of our annual price increases. EDI revenue increased due to higher EDI services sold with our NextGen Office cloud-based solutions and growth in EDI transaction volume due to the addition of new clients and further penetration of our existing client base. The decrease in non-recurring revenue was due to lower software license and hardware revenue, partially offset by an increase in other non-recurring services. The decline in software license and hardware reflects lower recent bookings associated with the increasingly saturated end-market for electronic health records software and our transition to a recurring subscription-based model. The increase in other non-recurring services is primarily due to an increase in consulting service and other professional services based on demand from our customers.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nThe following table presents our consolidated cost of revenue and gross profit for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recurring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 191,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 194,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 179,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software, hardware, and other non-recurring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of capitalized software costs and acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 246,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 241,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 223,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 282,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 289,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 286,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue consists primarily of compensation expense, including share-based compensation, for personnel that deliver our products and services. Cost of revenue also includes amortization of capitalized software costs and acquired technology, third party consultant and outsourcing costs, costs associated with our EDI business partners and clearinghouses, hosting service costs, third party software costs and royalties, and other costs directly associated with delivering our products and services. Refer to Note 7, \"Intangible Assets\" and Note 8, \"Capitalized Software Costs\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on current period amortization of capitalized software costs and acquired technology and an estimate of future expected amortization.\nShare-based compensation expense included in cost of revenue was $1.3 million, $0.9 million, and $0.5 million for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and is included in the amounts in the table above.\nGross profit for the year ended March 31, 2019 decreased $7.0 million compared to the prior year due to the $1.8 million lower revenues discussed above, combined with an increase of $5.2 million in cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is primarily the result of $6.4 million higher amortization of previously capitalized software development costs and higher\namortization of the software technology intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of EagleDream in August 2017 and Inforth in January 2018 and higher costs of software, hardware and other non-recurring revenues due to increased third party and consulting costs associated with higher related revenues, which was partially offset by lower cost of recurring revenue due to lower headcount associated with delivering our support and maintenance services. Our gross margin percentage decreased to 53.4% for the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to 54.5% in the prior year period primarily due to the higher amortization of previously capitalized software development costs and higher amortization of the software technology intangible assets described above.\nGross profit for the year ended March 31, 2018 increased $3.0 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 due to the $21.4 million higher revenues discussed above, combined with an increase of $18.4 million in cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is primarily the result of higher costs associated with the acquisitions of Entrada in April 2017 and EagleDream in August 2017, higher amortization of the software technology intangible assets associated with our recent acquisitions, higher EDI vendor costs associated with higher transaction volumes, and higher personnel costs associated with delivering our support and maintenance and managed services, partially offset by lower amortization of previously capitalized software development cost. The decrease in our gross margin percentage to 54.5% for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to 56.2% in the year ended March 31, 2017 primarily reflects the decline in our high margin software revenue as noted above, partially offset by improvements in the profitability of our professional services driven by the growth in sales described above.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nThe following table presents our consolidated selling, general and administrative expense for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 164,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 193,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative, as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expense consist of compensation expense, including share-based compensation, for management and administrative personnel, selling and marketing expense, facilities costs, depreciation, professional service fees, including legal and accounting services, legal settlements, acquisition and transaction-related costs, and other general corporate and administrative expenses.\nShare-based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses was $11.9 million, $9.2 million, and $6.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and is included in the amounts in the table above. The increase in share-based compensation expense for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 compared to the preceding years are due to increased utilization of share-based awards to incentivize our executives and employees. Refer to Note 13, \"Share-Based Awards\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on equity award grants.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $28.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to a $5.7 million net benefit recorded in the current year from insurance recoveries related to the settlement of the Federal Securities Class Action complaint, compared to $19.0 million accrued at the end of the prior year for the preliminary settlement of the complaint (refer to Note 14, Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information). Selling, general and administrative expenses further decreased by approximately $6.8 million due to lower commissions and related benefits expense as a result of the adoption of ASC 606 (refer to Note 3, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d for additional information) and decreased due to lower legal related and consulting costs, which were partially offset by increases personnel costs, including share-based compensation, and higher communication costs. In the prior year, we incurred higher legal fees in defense of our securities litigation complaints and higher consulting costs associated with our adoption of the new revenue standard (ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers), including implementation of a new accounting system module.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $29.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 primarily due to higher incremental costs associated with our acquisitions of Entrada in April 2017 EagleDream in August 2017, higher personnel costs, including share-based compensation, higher advertising and marketing expense related to our rebranding efforts, higher consulting costs associated with our adoption of the new revenue standard, higher legal expense, and an accrual of $19.0 million for the preliminary settlement of the Federal Securities Class Action complaint, offset by $3.8 million of fair value adjustments related to the HealthFusion contingent consideration recorded in the year ended March 31, 2017.\nResearch and Development Costs, net\nThe following table presents our consolidated net research and development costs, capitalized software costs, and gross expenditures prior to capitalization, for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized software costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20,571\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,865\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,249\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 81,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development costs, as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized software costs as a percentage of gross expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross research and development expenditures, including costs expensed and costs capitalized, consist of compensation expense, including share-based compensation for research and development personnel, certain third-party consultant fees, software maintenance costs, and other costs related to new product development and enhancement to our existing products. We intend to continue to invest heavily in research and development expenses as we continue to bring additional functionality and features to the medical community and develop a new integrated inpatient and outpatient, web-based software platform.\nThe capitalization of software development costs results in a reduction to our reported net research and development costs. Our software capitalization rate, or capitalized software costs as a percentage of gross expenditures, has varied historically and may continue to vary based on the nature and status of specific projects and initiatives in progress. Although changes in software capitalization rates have no impact on our overall cash flows, it results in fluctuations in the amount of software development costs being expensed up front and the amount of net research and development costs reported in our consolidated statement of net income and comprehensive income.\nShare-based compensation expense included in research and development costs was $2.9 million, $2.0 million, and $1.0 million for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and is included in the amounts in the table above.\nNet research and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2019 decreased $0.3 million compared to the prior year due to a $1.4 million increase in our gross expenditures, offset by $1.7 million in higher capitalization of software costs. The increase in gross expenditures is primarily the result of incremental costs incurred for the development of the next versions of our software products and enhancements to our existing products, including increased hosting fees, higher utilization of our Bangalore development center resources, and increased share-based compensation expense, as noted above, which were partially offset by lower consulting and outside services costs and lower personnel costs due to reductions in our headcount.\nOur software capitalization rate fluctuates due to differences in the nature and status of our projects and initiatives during a given year, which affects the amount of development costs that may be capitalized and ultimately also affects the future amortization of our previously capitalized software development costs.\nNet research and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2018 increased $2.9 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 due to a $13.5 million increase in our gross expenditures, offset by $10.6 million in higher capitalization of software costs. The increase in both gross expenditures and capitalization of software costs are related to the development of the next major versions of our core software products and enhancements to our existing products, for which we incurred a higher personnel and third party development costs. Additionally, gross expenditures increased due to the incremental costs associated with the acquisition of Entrada in April 2017 and growth in our research and development headcount.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets\nThe following table presents our amortization of acquired intangible assets for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets included in operating expense consist of the amortization related to our customer relationships, trade name, and contracts intangible assets acquired as part of our business combinations. Refer to Note 7, \"Intangible Assets\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for an estimate of future expected amortization.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2019 decreased $3.5 million, compared to the prior year period due to certain acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the year and decreased amortization as a result of the impairment of our acquired trade names intangible assets in the prior year, as described further within the Impairment of Assets\u201d section below.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2018 decreased $2.6 million, compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 due to certain acquired intangible assets being fully amortized during the year, partially offset by the incremental amortization associated with intangible assets acquired from Inforth, EagleDream and Entrada.\nImpairment of Assets\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2018, we recorded an impairment of $3.8 million to our acquired trade names intangible assets that is reflected within the impairment of assets caption in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income. The impairment was the result of the elimination of certain legacy brand and trade names due to the launching of our new branding, identity, and corporate logo intended to reflect our expanded health technology portfolio following years of recent acquisitions.\nRestructuring Costs\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2017, as part of our corporate restructuring plan, we recorded $7.1 million of restructuring costs within operating expenses in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income. The restructuring costs consisted primarily of payroll-related costs, such as severance, outplacement costs, and continuing healthcare coverage, associated with the involuntary separation of employees pursuant to a one-time benefit arrangement, which were accrued when it was probable that the benefits would be paid and the amounts were reasonably estimable. The restructuring plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2017. Refer to Note 15, \"Restructuring Plan\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information.\nAlso included in restructuring costs were certain facilities-related costs associated with accruals for the remaining lease obligations at certain locations, including Solana Beach, Costa Mesa, and a portion of Horsham with contractual lease terms ending between January 2018 and September 2023. We have vacated each of the locations or portions thereof and are actively marketing the locations for sublease. We estimated the remaining lease obligations at fair value as of the cease-use date for each location based on the future contractual lease obligations, reduced by projected sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the locations after a period of marketing, and adjusted for the effect deferred rents that have been recognized under the lease. The effect of discounting future cash flows using a credit-adjusted risk free rate was not significant. Sublease income and commencement dates were estimated based on data available from rental activity in the local markets. Significant judgment was required to estimate the remaining lease obligations at fair value and actual results could vary from the estimates, resulting in potential future adjustments to amounts previously recorded.\nWe recorded $0.6 million of restructuring costs related to adjustments to the estimated fair value of remaining lease obligations in each of the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. As of March 31, 2019, and March 31, 2018, the remaining lease obligation, net of estimated projected sublease rentals, was $1.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Refer to Note 14, \"Commitments, Guarantees, and Contingencies,\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for estimated timing of payments related to remaining lease obligations.\nInterest Expense\nThe following table presents our interest expense for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,814\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,323\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,156\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (262\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense relates to our revolving credit agreement and the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. Refer to Note 9, Line of Credit\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information.\nInterest expense for the year ended March 31, 2019 decreased $0.5 million compared to the prior year. Interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2018 increased $0.2 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2017. The changes in interest expense is primarily caused by fluctuations in outstanding balances under our revolving credit agreement and the related amortization of debt issuance costs.\nAs of March 31, 2019, we had $11.0 million in outstanding loans under the revolving credit agreement.\nProvision for (Benefit of) Income Taxes\nThe following table presents our provision for (benefit of) income taxes for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for (benefit of) income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,830\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 690.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe change in the effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period was driven primarily by the increase in pretax income for the current year, which was mostly offset by the release of uncertain tax position reserves for the year ended March 31, 2018.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we completed our analysis of the new tax reform legislation, which was enacted December 22, 2017, and recorded a net tax benefit in the tax provision. We consider the accounting for the income tax effects of the new tax reform legislation to be complete and all adjustments to the provisional estimates have been finalized. The recorded impacts of the tax reform legislation are based on our current knowledge, interpretation, and assumptions. Refer to Note 11, \"Income Taxes\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for more information.\nThe change in the effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 was driven primarily by a decrease in pretax income. The effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2018 also benefitted from an increase in the research and development tax credit, the release of uncertain tax position reserves, and a benefit from the lower federal tax rate, which was partially offset by the tax reform's elimination of the qualified production activities deduction, effective April 1, 2018, and a one-time revaluation of deferred taxes and a foreign transition tax resulting from the tax reform legislation.\nNet Income\nThe following table presents our net income (in thousands) and net income per share and for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income per share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of the foregoing changes in revenue and expense, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 increased $22.1 million compared to the prior year period.\nAs a result of the foregoing changes in revenue and expense, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 decreased $15.8 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents selected financial statistics and information for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unused portion of revolving credit agreement (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 289,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 263,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 235,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 322,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 291,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 272,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> As of March 31, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings of $11.0 million under our $300.0 million revolving credit agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash generated from operations, driven mostly by our net income and working capital management, our cash and cash equivalents, and our revolving credit agreement.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of March 31, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents balance of $33.1 million compares to $28.8 million as of March 31, 2018.\nOur outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement was $11.0 million as of March 31, 2019 compared to $37.0 million as of March 31, 2018.\nWe may continue to use a portion of our funds as well as available financing from our revolving credit agreement for future acquisitions or other similar business activities, although the specific timing and amount of funds to be used is not currently determinable. We intend to expend some of our available funds for the development of products complementary to our existing product line as well as new versions of certain of our products. These developments are intended to take advantage of more powerful technologies and to increase the integration of our products.\nOur investment policy is determined by our Board of Directors. Excess cash, if any, may be invested in very liquid short term assets including tax exempt and taxable money market funds, certificates of deposit and short term municipal bonds with average maturities of 365 days or less at the time of purchase. Our Board of Directors continues to review alternate uses for our cash including an expansion of our investment policy and other items. Any or all of these programs could significantly impact our investment income in future periods.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at March 31, 2019, together with our cash flows from operations and liquidity provided by our revolving credit agreement, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash from net income, as adjusted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 91,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in contract assets and liabilities, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,943\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,493\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in accounts receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,178\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,409\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in other assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29,550\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities decreased $23.6 million compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributed to a decrease of $40.9 million from net changes in other assets and liabilities and a decrease of $6.6 million from net changes in accounts receivable and contract balances, offset by an increase of $23.9 million due to higher net income, as adjusted for non-cash expenses. The net decrease in cash from changes in other assets and liabilities was mostly related to the current year settlement of the Federal Securities Class Action complaint that was accrued in the prior year and higher capitalization of commissions costs associated with the adoption of ASC 606 (refer to Note 3, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information), which was partially offset by a net increase in cash from changes in income taxes receivable and payable.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, cash provided by operating activities decreased $36.1 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in cash flows was primarily due to a decrease of $18.4 million from net changes in other assets and liabilities, of which $43.3 million was associated with changes in income taxes receivable and payable, offset by an accrual of $19.0 million for a preliminary settlement of the Federal Securities Class Action complaint (refer to Note 14, Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information), and higher deferred rents and accruals for remaining lease obligations of our vacated properties. Net cash provided from net income, as adjusted for non-cash expenses, decreased $13.1 million primarily due to $15.8 million decrease in net income, offset by higher non-cash expenses during the year ended March 31, 2018. The increase in non-cash expenses was driven by changes in deferred taxes, higher share-based compensation, and impairment of assets recorded during the year ended March 31, 2018, offset by lower amortization of previously capitalized software costs, and lower non-cash expense associated with changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $25.5 million, $91.5 million, and $11.4 million, respectively. The $66.0 million net decrease in cash used in investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily due to $62.9 million of cash paid (net of cash acquired) for the acquisitions of Entrada, EagleDream and Inforth in the prior year and a $4.8 million decrease in additions to equipment and improvements,\npartially offset by a $1.7 million increase in additions to capitalized software associated with the development of new products and enhancement of existing products.\nThe $80.1 million net increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the year March 31, 2017 is primarily due to $62.9 million of cash paid (net of cash acquired) for the acquisitions of Entrada, EagleDream and Inforth, $10.6 million increase in additions to capitalized software associated with the development of new products and enhancement of existing products, $9.3 million lower proceeds from sales of marketable securities, offset by a $2.4 million decrease in additions to equipment and improvements.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2019 was $21.6 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $6.1 million in the prior year. The increase in cash used by financing activities is due to $26.0 million in net repayments on our revolving credit facility, comprised of $52.0 million of principal repayments and $26.0 million of additional borrowings, which was partially offset by $4.4 million of net proceeds from the issuance of shares under employee plans. In comparison, during the prior year, we had net borrowings of $22.0 million on our revolving credit facility and $4.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of shares under employee plans, which was partially offset by $18.8 million paid to settle the contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of HealthFusion and $1.1 million of debt issuance costs paid related to the amendment of our revolving credit agreement.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2018 was $6.1 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $88.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2017. The increase in cash provided by financing activities relates to $22.0 million in net cash provided by our revolving credit facility, including $50.0 million of additional borrowings and $28.0 million of principal repayments, compared to repayments of $90.0 million on our line of credit during the year ended March 31, 2017. In addition, we received $4.0 million from the issuance of shares under employee stock plans, net of taxes paid for the net share settlement of equity awards. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the payment of $18.8 million for the settlement of our contingent consideration liability and payments of $1.1 million in debt issuance costs.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of March 31, 2019, we had minimum purchase commitments of $30.4 million related to payments due under certain non-cancelable agreements to purchase goods and services.\nThe following table summarizes our other significant contractual obligations at March 31, 2019 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash in future periods (in thousands):\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the year ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2025 and beyond\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remaining lease obligations for vacated properties (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Line of credit obligations (Note 9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Remaining lease obligations for vacated properties relates to remaining lease obligations at certain locations, including Austin, Solana Beach, and portions of Horsham and St. Louis, that we have vacated and are actively marketing the locations for sublease as part of our reorganization efforts.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d), including discussions of our product development plans, business strategies and market factors influencing our results, may include forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those anticipated by us as a result of various factors, both foreseen and unforeseen, including, but not limited to, our ability to continue to develop new products and increase systems sales in markets characterized by rapid technological evolution, consolidation and competition from larger, better-capitalized competitors. Many other economic, competitive, governmental and technological factors could affect our ability to achieve our goals and interested persons are urged to review any risks that may be described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d as set forth herein, as well as in our other public disclosures and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\nThis MD&A is provided as a supplement to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\"Report\") in order to enhance your understanding of our results of operations and financial condition and should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report. Historical results of operations, percentage margin fluctuations and any trends that may be inferred from the discussion below are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period.\nCompany Overview\nNextGen Healthcare is a leading provider of ambulatory-focused healthcare software and services solutions. In pursuit of our mission to empower the transformation of ambulatory care, we provide innovative technology-based solutions that help our clients succeed while they are managing more complexity and assuming greater financial risk.\nOur clients span the ambulatory care market from small single specialty practices to larger multi-specialty organizations. We have fully integrated our solutions so that our clients are able to provide their patients with comprehensive services utilizing a single platform. Our highly interoperable platform allows ambulatory practices to thrive especially in complex, heterogeneous healthcare communities where frictionless clinical data exchange is required to coordinate and optimize patient care.\nNextGen Healthcare has historically enhanced our solutions through both organic and inorganic activities. In October 2015, we divested our former Hospital Solutions division to focus exclusively on the ambulatory marketplace. In January 2016, we acquired HealthFusion Holdings, Inc. and its cloud-based electronic health record and practice management solution. In April 2017, we acquired Entrada, Inc. and its cloud-based, mobile platform for clinical documentation and collaboration. In August 2017, we acquired EagleDream Health, Inc. and its cloud-based population health analytics solution. In January 2018, we acquired Inforth Technologies for its specialty-focused clinical content. The integration of these acquired technologies have made NextGen Healthcare's solutions among the most comprehensive and powerful in the market.\nThe Company was incorporated in California in 1974. Previously named Quality Systems, Inc., the Company changed its corporate name to NextGen Healthcare, Inc. in September 2018. Our principal offices are located at 18111 Von Karman Ave., Suite 800, Irvine, California, 92612, and our principal website is www.nextgen.com. We operate on a fiscal year ending on March 31.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies and update our assumptions, estimates, and judgments, as needed, to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. To the extent that there are material differences between our estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected.\nOur significant accounting policies, as described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report, should be read in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results because application of such policies require significant judgment regarding the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and that affect our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 ( ASC 606\u201d) and all related amendments as of April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. ASC 606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605\u201d), and requires entities to recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Refer to Note 3, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies under ASC 606.\nReserves on Accounts Receivable\nWe maintain reserves for potential sales returns and uncollectible accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are reported net of uncollectible accounts receivable our consolidated balance sheets. Subsequent to the adoption of ASC 606 as of April 1, 2018, sales return reserves are classified as other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nOur standard contracts generally do not contain provisions for clients to return products or services. However, we historically have accepted sales returns under certain circumstances. Accordingly, we estimate sales return reserves, including reserves for returns and other credits, based upon our review of customer-specific facts and circumstances, including aged receivable balances, and recognize revenue, net of an allowance for sales returns. If we are unable to estimate the returns, revenue recognition may be delayed until the rights of return period lapses, provided also, that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. If we experience changes in practices related to sales returns or changes in actual return rates that deviate from the historical data on which our reserves had been established, our revenues may be adversely affected.\nAllowances for doubtful accounts and other uncollectible accounts receivable related to estimated losses resulting from our clients' inability to make required payments are established based on our historical experience of bad debt expense and the aging of our accounts receivable balances, net of deferred revenue and specifically reserved accounts. Specific reserves are based on our estimate of the probability of collection for certain troubled accounts. Accounts are written off as uncollectible only after we have expended extensive collection efforts.\nOur allowances for doubtful accounts are based on our assessment of the collectability of client accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the client receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a client's ability to pay and review of major third-party credit-rating agencies, as needed. If a major client's creditworthiness or financial condition were to deteriorate, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nAlthough we currently believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in required reserves that could be material.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs, consisting primarily of employee salaries and benefits and certain third party costs, incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products for external sale are expensed as incurred, and reported as net research and development costs in the consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income, until technological feasibility has been established. After technological feasibility is established, any additional external software development costs are capitalized. Amortization of capitalized software is recorded using the greater of the ratio of current revenues to the total of current and expected revenues of the related product or the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the related product, which is typically three years. The total of capitalized software costs incurred in the development of products for external sale are reported as capitalized software costs within our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe also incur costs to develop software applications for our internal-use and costs for the development of software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") based products sold to our clients. The development costs of our SaaS-based products are considered internal-use for accounting purposes. Our internal-use capitalized costs are stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is typically three years. Application development stage costs generally include costs associated with internal-use software configuration, coding, installation and testing. Costs related to the preliminary project stage and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Costs of significant upgrades and enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized, whereas costs incurred for maintenance and minor\nupgrades and enhancements are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software costs for developing SaaS-based products are reported as capitalized software costs within our consolidated balance sheets and capitalized software costs for developing our internal-use software applications are reported as equipment and improvements within our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe periodically reassess the estimated economic life and the recoverability of our capitalized software costs. If a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated net cash flows to be generated from sales of the applicable software product, the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs of a software product exceed the net realizable value is written off as a charge to earnings. The net realizable value is the estimated future gross revenues from that product reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product, including the costs of performing maintenance and client support required to satisfy our responsibility at the time of sale. In addition to the assessment of net realizable value, we routinely review and adjust, if necessary, the remaining estimated lives of our capitalized software costs. Additionally, we perform a periodic review of our clients' usage of our software products and dispose of fully amortized capitalized software costs after such products are determined to be no longer used by our clients.\nAlthough we currently believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe completed our acquisitions of Entrada, EagleDream and Inforth during the year ended March 31, 2018, all of which were accounted for as purchase business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting.\nIn accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, we allocated the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, including, but not limited to, intangible assets, goodwill, and contingent consideration liabilities. We estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses depending on the nature of the assets being sold. We estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities based on our projection of expected results, as needed. The process for estimating fair values in many cases requires the use of significant estimates, assumptions and judgments, including determining the timing and estimates of future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. We expect to finalize the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable within the measurement period, but not later than one year following the acquisition date. Any adjustments to fair value subsequent to the measurement period are reflected in the consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income.\nThe purchase price allocations of the Entrada, EagleDream and Inforth acquisitions are considered final.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination is measured as the excess of the purchase price, or consideration transferred, over the net acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized as it has been determined to have an indefinite useful life.\nAs part of our annual goodwill impairment test, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we conduct a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their carrying values. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually during our first fiscal quarter, referred to as the annual test date. Based on our qualitative assessment for the current fiscal year, we have determined that there was no impairment to our goodwill as of June 30, 2018. We will also test for impairment between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. We currently also do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will\nbe a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to future impairment charges that could be material.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of trade names and contracts, customer relationships, and software technology, all of which arose in connection with our acquisitions.\nThese intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are stated net of accumulated amortization. We currently amortize intangible assets using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed.\nAlthough currently we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to decreases in the fair value of our intangible assets, resulting in impairment charges that could be material. We test intangible assets for impairment if we believe indicators of impairment exist.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe record share-based compensation related to our employee stock options plans, employee share purchase plans, restricted stock awards, and restricted performance stock awards and shares. See Note 13, Share-Based Awards,\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for a complete discussion of our stock-based compensation plans.\nShare-based compensation expense associated with the stock options under our equity incentive plans is based on the number of options that ultimately vest and adjusted, if needed, as forfeitures occur. We estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model based on required inputs, including expected term, volatility, risk-free rate, and expected dividend yield. Expected term is estimated based upon the historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and therefore the proportion of awards that is expected to vest. Volatility is estimated by using the weighted-average historical volatility of our common stock, which approximates expected volatility. The risk-free rate is the implied yield available on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms equal to the expected term. The expected dividend yield is the average dividend rate during a period equal to the expected term of the option. The fair value vest is recognized ratably as expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income.\nShare-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards is estimated using the market price of the common stock on the date of grant. Share-based compensation expense associated with the restricted performance stock awards and shares is based on the grant date fair value measured at the underlying closing share price on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo-based valuation model.\nWe currently do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine share-based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in share-based compensation expense that could be material.\nTrends and Events in Our Business\nWe believe that the trends and events described below have contributed to our consolidated results of operations and may continue to impact our future results.\nOver the last decade, the ambulatory healthcare market has experienced significant regulatory change, which has driven practice transformation and technology advancements. Recognizing that it was imperative to digitize the American health system to stem the escalating cost of healthcare and improve the quality of care being delivered, Congress enacted the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act in 2009 ( HITECH Act\u201d). The legislation stimulated healthcare organizations to not only adopt electronic health records, but to use them to collect discrete data that could be used to drive quality care. This standardization supported early pay for reporting and pay-for-performance programs.\nIn 2010, the Affordable Care Act ( ACA\u201d) established the roadmap for shifting American healthcare from volume (fee-for-service) to a value-based care ( VBC\u201d) system that rewards improved outcomes at lower costs (fee-for-value). This was followed by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 ( MACRA\u201d), bipartisan legislation that further changed the way Medicare rewards clinicians for value vs. volume. Initially focused on government-funded care, the domain of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d), these programs are now firmly established on the commercial insurance side of the industry as well.\nVBC created the need for a new category of healthcare information technology ( HIT\u201d) tools that could be used to identify and treat groups of patients, or cohorts, based on risk. Population Health Management ( PHM\u201d) tools support these needs by identifying patient risk, engaging patients, coordinating care, and determining when interventions are needed to improve clinical and financial outcomes. The United States PHM market was estimated at $3.1 billion in 2018 and is expected to more than double by 2022.\nImportantly, the introduction of VBC programs was only an element of the broader approach to reducing healthcare expenditure. It was also accompanied by significant reductions in Medicare spending with a projected reduction of $218 billion in payments by 2028, as reported by RevCycle Intelligence. The drive to reduce costs initially led to consolidation in the healthcare system that was followed by a significant shift of care from the inpatient to the outpatient setting as more care is being moved to this lower cost environment. Ambulatory care settings have become an essential component of comprehensive, low cost distributed care. In 2018, outpatient volumes reached over 3.5 billion encounters and are forecasted to grow 15% by 2028, as reported by Becker's Health IT and CIO Report. The independent physicians' practices segment is expected to generate more revenue than non-affiliated hospitals as it accepts electronic health records integrated PHM programs for better primary and follow-up care, as reported by Frost & Sullivan. The need to sustain revenue has made it extremely important for practices to secure their patient market share, elevating patient loyalty to be a significant determinant of provider success. Capturing patient market share and thriving in a market driven by VBC requires both an integrated platform and a full view of the patient population's clinical and cost data neither of which could be accomplished without new technologies to collect and analyze multi-sourced patient data. Effectively implemented, these new technologies allow organizations to enhance financial viability while exercising the freedom to join, affiliate, integrate or interoperate in ways that maximize strategic control.\nIn order to maintain financial success with shifting reimbursement rules and shrinking reimbursement, we believe demand for managed services, including revenue cycle management services ( RCMS\u201d), hosting, transcription and scribe services, aligned and integrated with clinical technology solutions, will increase in the coming years.\nBased on these trends, successful clients must undertake the following imperatives: 1) ensure healthy predictable financial outcomes, 2) provide high quality care at a lower cost in a risk-bearing environment, 3) ensure engaged and loyal patients, and 4) optimize clinician productivity while deploying HIT solutions, 5) support frictionless interoperability.\nOur core strategy is to become a trusted partner to our clients as they embark on their value-based journey and begin to take on risk as part of value-based contracts. We understand that our clients are now faced with a more complex, rapidly changing practice environment and that the HIT solutions that support these endeavors must evolve to meet these challenging requirements. Providing our clients with a comprehensive multi-faceted platform and accompanying services to enable their success is the key to our strategy.\nBased on current market trends, our strategic priorities are:\n \u2022 Focus on Ambulatory Care. We create for and invest in the specific needs of ambulatory care providers, giving us a distinct competitive advantage in our target market over solution providers who focus on hospitals first. While many of our competitors spread their R&D and localization investment across global regions, NextGen Healthcare maintains an exclusive focus on U.S.-only ambulatory practices. \n \u2022 Provide an integrated ambulatory care platform with superb scalability, flexibility and interoperability. Many healthcare challenges are uniquely local or regional -- our platform and capabilities flex and scale to fit our clients' practices and workflows, not the other way around. Our ability to interoperate is pervasive, allowing our clients to exchange data seamlessly. \n \u2022 Enable groups to successfully take on risk. We provide our clients with cloud-based population health tools that consume multi-sourced agnostic data, including adjudicated claims and risk stratification, care management tools, cost and utilization reporting, as well as quality measurement and reporting tools. Population health insights are delivered in core clinical and financial workflows enabling care givers to better engage their patients. \nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of revenue represented by each item in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (certain percentages below may not sum due to rounding):\n\nRevenues\nThe following table presents our consolidated revenues for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\n\nWe generate revenue from sales of licensing rights and subscriptions to our software solutions, hardware and third-party software products, support and maintenance, managed services (formerly referred to as revenue cycle management and related services), electronic data interchange and data services ( EDI\u201d), and other non-recurring services, including implementation, training, and consulting services performed for clients who use our products.\nConsolidated revenue for the year ended March 31, 2019 decreased $1.8 million compared to the prior year due to a $2.3 million decrease in recurring revenues, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in software, hardware and other non-recurring revenues. The decrease in recurring revenues was due to $15.1 million lower managed services revenue and $3.0 million lower support and maintenance revenue, partially offset by $11.2 million higher subscriptions and $4.6 million higher EDI services revenue. A decrease of approximately $12.5 million in managed services is attributed to the adoption of ASC 606, whereby a portion of service fees associated with revenue cycle management ( RCM\u201d) arrangements are now classified within other revenue categories, such as subscription services, support and maintenance, and software license and hardware. Managed services revenue further decreased compared to the prior year due to higher levels of client attrition experienced in recent periods. The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in $7.5 million higher subscription services revenue and $5.3 million higher support and maintenance revenue, which were partially offset by lower revenue due to higher client attrition during the year. EDI revenue increased due to higher EDI services sold with our NextGen Office cloud-based solutions and growth in EDI transaction volume due to the addition of new clients and further penetration of our existing client base as well as incremental revenues earned from the sales of certain clinical data. Total software, hardware, and other non-recurring revenue increased approximately $1.4 million due to the adoption of ASC 606, partially offset by $1.0 million lower revenue based on lower demand from our clients for our software products and related implementation services.\nConsolidated revenue for the year ended March 31, 2018 increased $21.4 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2017, due to a $27.9 million increase in recurring revenues, offset by a $6.5 million decrease in non-recurring revenues. The increase in recurring revenues was due to a $12.2 million increase in subscription services, $6.9 million increase in managed services revenue, $5.0 million increase in support and maintenance, and $3.8 million increase in EDI revenue. Subscription revenues increased due to higher sales of our NextGen Office cloud-based subscriptions, and incremental sales of our NextGen Mobile and NextGen Population Health cloud-based solutions acquired from Entrada in April 2017 and EagleDream in August 2017, respectively. Managed services revenue benefit from higher RCM services revenue from the addition of new clients and organic growth achieved through cross selling and ramping up of RCM services provided to our existing clients, which was offset by customer attrition as well as higher sales of our hosting services. The increase in support and maintenance is primarily due to lower sales credits in the current year, addition of new customers, and the impact of our annual price increases. EDI revenue increased due to higher EDI services sold with our NextGen Office cloud-based solutions and growth in EDI transaction volume due to the addition of new clients and further penetration of our existing client base. The decrease in non-recurring revenue was due to lower software license and hardware revenue, partially offset by an increase in other non-recurring services. The decline in software license and hardware reflects lower recent bookings associated with the increasingly saturated end-market for electronic health records software and our transition to a recurring subscription-based model. The increase in other non-recurring services is primarily due to an increase in consulting service and other professional services based on demand from our customers.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nThe following table presents our consolidated cost of revenue and gross profit for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\n\nCost of revenue consists primarily of compensation expense, including share-based compensation, for personnel that deliver our products and services. Cost of revenue also includes amortization of capitalized software costs and acquired technology, third party consultant and outsourcing costs, costs associated with our EDI business partners and clearinghouses, hosting service costs, third party software costs and royalties, and other costs directly associated with delivering our products and services. Refer to Note 7, \"Intangible Assets\" and Note 8, \"Capitalized Software Costs\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on current period amortization of capitalized software costs and acquired technology and an estimate of future expected amortization.\nShare-based compensation expense included in cost of revenue was $1.3 million, $0.9 million, and $0.5 million for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and is included in the amounts in the table above.\nGross profit for the year ended March 31, 2019 decreased $7.0 million compared to the prior year due to the $1.8 million lower revenues discussed above, combined with an increase of $5.2 million in cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is primarily the result of $6.4 million higher amortization of previously capitalized software development costs and higher\namortization of the software technology intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of EagleDream in August 2017 and Inforth in January 2018 and higher costs of software, hardware and other non-recurring revenues due to increased third party and consulting costs associated with higher related revenues, which was partially offset by lower cost of recurring revenue due to lower headcount associated with delivering our support and maintenance services. Our gross margin percentage decreased to 53.4% for the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to 54.5% in the prior year period primarily due to the higher amortization of previously capitalized software development costs and higher amortization of the software technology intangible assets described above.\nGross profit for the year ended March 31, 2018 increased $3.0 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 due to the $21.4 million higher revenues discussed above, combined with an increase of $18.4 million in cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is primarily the result of higher costs associated with the acquisitions of Entrada in April 2017 and EagleDream in August 2017, higher amortization of the software technology intangible assets associated with our recent acquisitions, higher EDI vendor costs associated with higher transaction volumes, and higher personnel costs associated with delivering our support and maintenance and managed services, partially offset by lower amortization of previously capitalized software development cost. The decrease in our gross margin percentage to 54.5% for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to 56.2% in the year ended March 31, 2017 primarily reflects the decline in our high margin software revenue as noted above, partially offset by improvements in the profitability of our professional services driven by the growth in sales described above.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nThe following table presents our consolidated selling, general and administrative expense for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense consist of compensation expense, including share-based compensation, for management and administrative personnel, selling and marketing expense, facilities costs, depreciation, professional service fees, including legal and accounting services, legal settlements, acquisition and transaction-related costs, and other general corporate and administrative expenses.\nShare-based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses was $11.9 million, $9.2 million, and $6.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and is included in the amounts in the table above. The increase in share-based compensation expense for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 compared to the preceding years are due to increased utilization of share-based awards to incentivize our executives and employees. Refer to Note 13, \"Share-Based Awards\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on equity award grants.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $28.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to a $5.7 million net benefit recorded in the current year from insurance recoveries related to the settlement of the Federal Securities Class Action complaint, compared to $19.0 million accrued at the end of the prior year for the preliminary settlement of the complaint (refer to Note 14, Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information). Selling, general and administrative expenses further decreased by approximately $6.8 million due to lower commissions and related benefits expense as a result of the adoption of ASC 606 (refer to Note 3, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d for additional information) and decreased due to lower legal related and consulting costs, which were partially offset by increases personnel costs, including share-based compensation, and higher communication costs. In the prior year, we incurred higher legal fees in defense of our securities litigation complaints and higher consulting costs associated with our adoption of the new revenue standard (ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers), including implementation of a new accounting system module.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $29.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 primarily due to higher incremental costs associated with our acquisitions of Entrada in April 2017 EagleDream in August 2017, higher personnel costs, including share-based compensation, higher advertising and marketing expense related to our rebranding efforts, higher consulting costs associated with our adoption of the new revenue standard, higher legal expense, and an accrual of $19.0 million for the preliminary settlement of the Federal Securities Class Action complaint, offset by $3.8 million of fair value adjustments related to the HealthFusion contingent consideration recorded in the year ended March 31, 2017.\nResearch and Development Costs, net\nThe following table presents our consolidated net research and development costs, capitalized software costs, and gross expenditures prior to capitalization, for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\n\nGross research and development expenditures, including costs expensed and costs capitalized, consist of compensation expense, including share-based compensation for research and development personnel, certain third-party consultant fees, software maintenance costs, and other costs related to new product development and enhancement to our existing products. We intend to continue to invest heavily in research and development expenses as we continue to bring additional functionality and features to the medical community and develop a new integrated inpatient and outpatient, web-based software platform.\nThe capitalization of software development costs results in a reduction to our reported net research and development costs. Our software capitalization rate, or capitalized software costs as a percentage of gross expenditures, has varied historically and may continue to vary based on the nature and status of specific projects and initiatives in progress. Although changes in software capitalization rates have no impact on our overall cash flows, it results in fluctuations in the amount of software development costs being expensed up front and the amount of net research and development costs reported in our consolidated statement of net income and comprehensive income.\nShare-based compensation expense included in research and development costs was $2.9 million, $2.0 million, and $1.0 million for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and is included in the amounts in the table above.\nNet research and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2019 decreased $0.3 million compared to the prior year due to a $1.4 million increase in our gross expenditures, offset by $1.7 million in higher capitalization of software costs. The increase in gross expenditures is primarily the result of incremental costs incurred for the development of the next versions of our software products and enhancements to our existing products, including increased hosting fees, higher utilization of our Bangalore development center resources, and increased share-based compensation expense, as noted above, which were partially offset by lower consulting and outside services costs and lower personnel costs due to reductions in our headcount.\nOur software capitalization rate fluctuates due to differences in the nature and status of our projects and initiatives during a given year, which affects the amount of development costs that may be capitalized and ultimately also affects the future amortization of our previously capitalized software development costs.\nNet research and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2018 increased $2.9 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 due to a $13.5 million increase in our gross expenditures, offset by $10.6 million in higher capitalization of software costs. The increase in both gross expenditures and capitalization of software costs are related to the development of the next major versions of our core software products and enhancements to our existing products, for which we incurred a higher personnel and third party development costs. Additionally, gross expenditures increased due to the incremental costs associated with the acquisition of Entrada in April 2017 and growth in our research and development headcount.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets\nThe following table presents our amortization of acquired intangible assets for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\n\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets included in operating expense consist of the amortization related to our customer relationships, trade name, and contracts intangible assets acquired as part of our business combinations. Refer to Note 7, \"Intangible Assets\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for an estimate of future expected amortization.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2019 decreased $3.5 million, compared to the prior year period due to certain acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the year and decreased amortization as a result of the impairment of our acquired trade names intangible assets in the prior year, as described further within the Impairment of Assets\u201d section below.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2018 decreased $2.6 million, compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 due to certain acquired intangible assets being fully amortized during the year, partially offset by the incremental amortization associated with intangible assets acquired from Inforth, EagleDream and Entrada.\nImpairment of Assets\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2018, we recorded an impairment of $3.8 million to our acquired trade names intangible assets that is reflected within the impairment of assets caption in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income. The impairment was the result of the elimination of certain legacy brand and trade names due to the launching of our new branding, identity, and corporate logo intended to reflect our expanded health technology portfolio following years of recent acquisitions.\nRestructuring Costs\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2017, as part of our corporate restructuring plan, we recorded $7.1 million of restructuring costs within operating expenses in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income. The restructuring costs consisted primarily of payroll-related costs, such as severance, outplacement costs, and continuing healthcare coverage, associated with the involuntary separation of employees pursuant to a one-time benefit arrangement, which were accrued when it was probable that the benefits would be paid and the amounts were reasonably estimable. The restructuring plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2017. Refer to Note 15, \"Restructuring Plan\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information.\nAlso included in restructuring costs were certain facilities-related costs associated with accruals for the remaining lease obligations at certain locations, including Solana Beach, Costa Mesa, and a portion of Horsham with contractual lease terms ending between January 2018 and September 2023. We have vacated each of the locations or portions thereof and are actively marketing the locations for sublease. We estimated the remaining lease obligations at fair value as of the cease-use date for each location based on the future contractual lease obligations, reduced by projected sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the locations after a period of marketing, and adjusted for the effect deferred rents that have been recognized under the lease. The effect of discounting future cash flows using a credit-adjusted risk free rate was not significant. Sublease income and commencement dates were estimated based on data available from rental activity in the local markets. Significant judgment was required to estimate the remaining lease obligations at fair value and actual results could vary from the estimates, resulting in potential future adjustments to amounts previously recorded.\nWe recorded $0.6 million of restructuring costs related to adjustments to the estimated fair value of remaining lease obligations in each of the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. As of March 31, 2019, and March 31, 2018, the remaining lease obligation, net of estimated projected sublease rentals, was $1.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Refer to Note 14, \"Commitments, Guarantees, and Contingencies,\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for estimated timing of payments related to remaining lease obligations.\nInterest Expense\nThe following table presents our interest expense for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\n\nInterest expense relates to our revolving credit agreement and the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. Refer to Note 9, Line of Credit\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information.\nInterest expense for the year ended March 31, 2019 decreased $0.5 million compared to the prior year. Interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2018 increased $0.2 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2017. The changes in interest expense is primarily caused by fluctuations in outstanding balances under our revolving credit agreement and the related amortization of debt issuance costs.\nAs of March 31, 2019, we had $11.0 million in outstanding loans under the revolving credit agreement.\nProvision for (Benefit of) Income Taxes\nThe following table presents our provision for (benefit of) income taxes for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\n\nThe change in the effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period was driven primarily by the increase in pretax income for the current year, which was mostly offset by the release of uncertain tax position reserves for the year ended March 31, 2018.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we completed our analysis of the new tax reform legislation, which was enacted December 22, 2017, and recorded a net tax benefit in the tax provision. We consider the accounting for the income tax effects of the new tax reform legislation to be complete and all adjustments to the provisional estimates have been finalized. The recorded impacts of the tax reform legislation are based on our current knowledge, interpretation, and assumptions. Refer to Note 11, \"Income Taxes\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for more information.\nThe change in the effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 was driven primarily by a decrease in pretax income. The effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2018 also benefitted from an increase in the research and development tax credit, the release of uncertain tax position reserves, and a benefit from the lower federal tax rate, which was partially offset by the tax reform's elimination of the qualified production activities deduction, effective April 1, 2018, and a one-time revaluation of deferred taxes and a foreign transition tax resulting from the tax reform legislation.\nNet Income\nThe following table presents our net income (in thousands) and net income per share and for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\n\nAs a result of the foregoing changes in revenue and expense, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 increased $22.1 million compared to the prior year period.\nAs a result of the foregoing changes in revenue and expense, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 decreased $15.8 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents selected financial statistics and information for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\n\n (1) As of March 31, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings of $11.0 million under our $300.0 million revolving credit agreement. \nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash generated from operations, driven mostly by our net income and working capital management, our cash and cash equivalents, and our revolving credit agreement.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of March 31, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents balance of $33.1 million compares to $28.8 million as of March 31, 2018.\nOur outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement was $11.0 million as of March 31, 2019 compared to $37.0 million as of March 31, 2018.\nWe may continue to use a portion of our funds as well as available financing from our revolving credit agreement for future acquisitions or other similar business activities, although the specific timing and amount of funds to be used is not currently determinable. We intend to expend some of our available funds for the development of products complementary to our existing product line as well as new versions of certain of our products. These developments are intended to take advantage of more powerful technologies and to increase the integration of our products.\nOur investment policy is determined by our Board of Directors. Excess cash, if any, may be invested in very liquid short term assets including tax exempt and taxable money market funds, certificates of deposit and short term municipal bonds with average maturities of 365 days or less at the time of purchase. Our Board of Directors continues to review alternate uses for our cash including an expansion of our investment policy and other items. Any or all of these programs could significantly impact our investment income in future periods.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at March 31, 2019, together with our cash flows from operations and liquidity provided by our revolving credit agreement, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\n\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities decreased $23.6 million compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributed to a decrease of $40.9 million from net changes in other assets and liabilities and a decrease of $6.6 million from net changes in accounts receivable and contract balances, offset by an increase of $23.9 million due to higher net income, as adjusted for non-cash expenses. The net decrease in cash from changes in other assets and liabilities was mostly related to the current year settlement of the Federal Securities Class Action complaint that was accrued in the prior year and higher capitalization of commissions costs associated with the adoption of ASC 606 (refer to Note 3, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information), which was partially offset by a net increase in cash from changes in income taxes receivable and payable.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, cash provided by operating activities decreased $36.1 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in cash flows was primarily due to a decrease of $18.4 million from net changes in other assets and liabilities, of which $43.3 million was associated with changes in income taxes receivable and payable, offset by an accrual of $19.0 million for a preliminary settlement of the Federal Securities Class Action complaint (refer to Note 14, Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information), and higher deferred rents and accruals for remaining lease obligations of our vacated properties. Net cash provided from net income, as adjusted for non-cash expenses, decreased $13.1 million primarily due to $15.8 million decrease in net income, offset by higher non-cash expenses during the year ended March 31, 2018. The increase in non-cash expenses was driven by changes in deferred taxes, higher share-based compensation, and impairment of assets recorded during the year ended March 31, 2018, offset by lower", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d), including discussions of our product development plans, business strategies and market factors influencing our results, may include forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those anticipated by us as a result of various factors, both foreseen and unforeseen, including, but not limited to, our ability to continue to develop new products and increase systems sales in markets characterized by rapid technological evolution, consolidation and competition from larger, better-capitalized competitors. Many other economic, competitive, governmental and technological factors could affect our ability to achieve our goals and interested persons are urged to review any risks that may be described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d as set forth herein, as well as in our other public disclosures and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\nThis MD&A is provided as a supplement to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\"Report\") in order to enhance your understanding of our results of operations and financial condition and should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report. Historical results of operations, percentage margin fluctuations and any trends that may be inferred from the discussion below are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period.\nCompany Overview\nNextGen Healthcare is a leading provider of ambulatory-focused healthcare software and services solutions. In pursuit of our mission to empower the transformation of ambulatory care, we provide innovative technology-based solutions that help our clients succeed while they are managing more complexity and assuming greater financial risk.\nOur clients span the ambulatory care market from small single specialty practices to larger multi-specialty organizations. We have fully integrated our solutions so that our clients are able to provide their patients with comprehensive services utilizing a single platform. Our highly interoperable platform allows ambulatory practices to thrive especially in complex, heterogeneous healthcare communities where frictionless clinical data exchange is required to coordinate and optimize patient care.\nNextGen Healthcare has historically enhanced our solutions through both organic and inorganic activities. In October 2015, we divested our former Hospital Solutions division to focus exclusively on the ambulatory marketplace. In January 2016, we acquired HealthFusion Holdings, Inc. and its cloud-based electronic health record and practice management solution. In April 2017, we acquired Entrada, Inc. and its cloud-based, mobile platform for clinical documentation and collaboration. In August 2017, we acquired EagleDream Health, Inc. and its cloud-based population health analytics solution. In January 2018, we acquired Inforth Technologies for its specialty-focused clinical content. The integration of these acquired technologies have made NextGen Healthcare's solutions among the most comprehensive and powerful in the market.\nThe Company was incorporated in California in 1974. Previously named Quality Systems, Inc., the Company changed its corporate name to NextGen Healthcare, Inc. in September 2018. Our principal offices are located at 18111 Von Karman Ave., Suite 800, Irvine, California, 92612, and our principal website is www.nextgen.com. We operate on a fiscal year ending on March 31.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies and update our assumptions, estimates, and judgments, as needed, to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. To the extent that there are material differences between our estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected.\nOur significant accounting policies, as described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report, should be read in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results because application of such policies require significant judgment regarding the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and that affect our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 ( ASC 606\u201d) and all related amendments as of April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. ASC 606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605\u201d), and requires entities to recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Refer to Note 3, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies under ASC 606.\nReserves on Accounts Receivable\nWe maintain reserves for potential sales returns and uncollectible accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are reported net of uncollectible accounts receivable our consolidated balance sheets. Subsequent to the adoption of ASC 606 as of April 1, 2018, sales return reserves are classified as other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nOur standard contracts generally do not contain provisions for clients to return products or services. However, we historically have accepted sales returns under certain circumstances. Accordingly, we estimate sales return reserves, including reserves for returns and other credits, based upon our review of customer-specific facts and circumstances, including aged receivable balances, and recognize revenue, net of an allowance for sales returns. If we are unable to estimate the returns, revenue recognition may be delayed until the rights of return period lapses, provided also, that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. If we experience changes in practices related to sales returns or changes in actual return rates that deviate from the historical data on which our reserves had been established, our revenues may be adversely affected.\nAllowances for doubtful accounts and other uncollectible accounts receivable related to estimated losses resulting from our clients' inability to make required payments are established based on our historical experience of bad debt expense and the aging of our accounts receivable balances, net of deferred revenue and specifically reserved accounts. Specific reserves are based on our estimate of the probability of collection for certain troubled accounts. Accounts are written off as uncollectible only after we have expended extensive collection efforts.\nOur allowances for doubtful accounts are based on our assessment of the collectability of client accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the client receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a client's ability to pay and review of major third-party credit-rating agencies, as needed. If a major client's creditworthiness or financial condition were to deteriorate, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nAlthough we currently believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in required reserves that could be material.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs, consisting primarily of employee salaries and benefits and certain third party costs, incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products for external sale are expensed as incurred, and reported as net research and development costs in the consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income, until technological feasibility has been established. After technological feasibility is established, any additional external software development costs are capitalized. Amortization of capitalized software is recorded using the greater of the ratio of current revenues to the total of current and expected revenues of the related product or the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the related product, which is typically three years. The total of capitalized software costs incurred in the development of products for external sale are reported as capitalized software costs within our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe also incur costs to develop software applications for our internal-use and costs for the development of software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") based products sold to our clients. The development costs of our SaaS-based products are considered internal-use for accounting purposes. Our internal-use capitalized costs are stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is typically three years. Application development stage costs generally include costs associated with internal-use software configuration, coding, installation and testing. Costs related to the preliminary project stage and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Costs of significant upgrades and enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized, whereas costs incurred for maintenance and minor\nupgrades and enhancements are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software costs for developing SaaS-based products are reported as capitalized software costs within our consolidated balance sheets and capitalized software costs for developing our internal-use software applications are reported as equipment and improvements within our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe periodically reassess the estimated economic life and the recoverability of our capitalized software costs. If a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated net cash flows to be generated from sales of the applicable software product, the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs of a software product exceed the net realizable value is written off as a charge to earnings. The net realizable value is the estimated future gross revenues from that product reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product, including the costs of performing maintenance and client support required to satisfy our responsibility at the time of sale. In addition to the assessment of net realizable value, we routinely review and adjust, if necessary, the remaining estimated lives of our capitalized software costs. Additionally, we perform a periodic review of our clients' usage of our software products and dispose of fully amortized capitalized software costs after such products are determined to be no longer used by our clients.\nAlthough we currently believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe completed our acquisitions of Entrada, EagleDream and Inforth during the year ended March 31, 2018, all of which were accounted for as purchase business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting.\nIn accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, we allocated the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, including, but not limited to, intangible assets, goodwill, and contingent consideration liabilities. We estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses depending on the nature of the assets being sold. We estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities based on our projection of expected results, as needed. The process for estimating fair values in many cases requires the use of significant estimates, assumptions and judgments, including determining the timing and estimates of future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. We expect to finalize the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable within the measurement period, but not later than one year following the acquisition date. Any adjustments to fair value subsequent to the measurement period are reflected in the consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income.\nThe purchase price allocations of the Entrada, EagleDream and Inforth acquisitions are considered final.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination is measured as the excess of the purchase price, or consideration transferred, over the net acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized as it has been determined to have an indefinite useful life.\nAs part of our annual goodwill impairment test, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we conduct a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their carrying values. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually during our first fiscal quarter, referred to as the annual test date. Based on our qualitative assessment for the current fiscal year, we have determined that there was no impairment to our goodwill as of June 30, 2018. We will also test for impairment between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. We currently also do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will\nbe a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to future impairment charges that could be material.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of trade names and contracts, customer relationships, and software technology, all of which arose in connection with our acquisitions.\nThese intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are stated net of accumulated amortization. We currently amortize intangible assets using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed.\nAlthough currently we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to decreases in the fair value of our intangible assets, resulting in impairment charges that could be material. We test intangible assets for impairment if we believe indicators of impairment exist.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe record share-based compensation related to our employee stock options plans, employee share purchase plans, restricted stock awards, and restricted performance stock awards and shares. See Note 13, Share-Based Awards,\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for a complete discussion of our stock-based compensation plans.\nShare-based compensation expense associated with the stock options under our equity incentive plans is based on the number of options that ultimately vest and adjusted, if needed, as forfeitures occur. We estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model based on required inputs, including expected term, volatility, risk-free rate, and expected dividend yield. Expected term is estimated based upon the historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and therefore the proportion of awards that is expected to vest. Volatility is estimated by using the weighted-average historical volatility of our common stock, which approximates expected volatility. The risk-free rate is the implied yield available on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms equal to the expected term. The expected dividend yield is the average dividend rate during a period equal to the expected term of the option. The fair value vest is recognized ratably as expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income.\nShare-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards is estimated using the market price of the common stock on the date of grant. Share-based compensation expense associated with the restricted performance stock awards and shares is based on the grant date fair value measured at the underlying closing share price on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo-based valuation model.\nWe currently do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine share-based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in share-based compensation expense that could be material.\nTrends and Events in Our Business\nWe believe that the trends and events described below have contributed to our consolidated results of operations and may continue to impact our future results.\nOver the last decade, the ambulatory healthcare market has experienced significant regulatory change, which has driven practice transformation and technology advancements. Recognizing that it was imperative to digitize the American health system to stem the escalating cost of healthcare and improve the quality of care being delivered, Congress enacted the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act in 2009 ( HITECH Act\u201d). The legislation stimulated healthcare organizations to not only adopt electronic health records, but to use them to collect discrete data that could be used to drive quality care. This standardization supported early pay for reporting and pay-for-performance programs.\nIn 2010, the Affordable Care Act ( ACA\u201d) established the roadmap for shifting American healthcare from volume (fee-for-service) to a value-based care ( VBC\u201d) system that rewards improved outcomes at lower costs (fee-for-value). This was followed by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 ( MACRA\u201d), bipartisan legislation that further changed the way Medicare rewards clinicians for value vs. volume. Initially focused on government-funded care, the domain of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d), these programs are now firmly established on the commercial insurance side of the industry as well.\nVBC created the need for a new category of healthcare information technology ( HIT\u201d) tools that could be used to identify and treat groups of patients, or cohorts, based on risk. Population Health Management ( PHM\u201d) tools support these needs by identifying patient risk, engaging patients, coordinating care, and determining when interventions are needed to improve clinical and financial outcomes. The United States PHM market was estimated at $3.1 billion in 2018 and is expected to more than double by 2022.\nImportantly, the introduction of VBC programs was only an element of the broader approach to reducing healthcare expenditure. It was also accompanied by significant reductions in Medicare spending with a projected reduction of $218 billion in payments by 2028, as reported by RevCycle Intelligence. The drive to reduce costs initially led to consolidation in the healthcare system that was followed by a significant shift of care from the inpatient to the outpatient setting as more care is being moved to this lower cost environment. Ambulatory care settings have become an essential component of comprehensive, low cost distributed care. In 2018, outpatient volumes reached over 3.5 billion encounters and are forecasted to grow 15% by 2028, as reported by Becker's Health IT and CIO Report. The independent physicians' practices segment is expected to generate more revenue than non-affiliated hospitals as it accepts electronic health records integrated PHM programs for better primary and follow-up care, as reported by Frost & Sullivan. The need to sustain revenue has made it extremely important for practices to secure their patient market share, elevating patient loyalty to be a significant determinant of provider success. Capturing patient market share and thriving in a market driven by VBC requires both an integrated platform and a full view of the patient population's clinical and cost data neither of which could be accomplished without new technologies to collect and analyze multi-sourced patient data. Effectively implemented, these new technologies allow organizations to enhance financial viability while exercising the freedom to join, affiliate, integrate or interoperate in ways that maximize strategic control.\nIn order to maintain financial success with shifting reimbursement rules and shrinking reimbursement, we believe demand for managed services, including revenue cycle management services ( RCMS\u201d), hosting, transcription and scribe services, aligned and integrated with clinical technology solutions, will increase in the coming years.\nBased on these trends, successful clients must undertake the following imperatives: 1) ensure healthy predictable financial outcomes, 2) provide high quality care at a lower cost in a risk-bearing environment, 3) ensure engaged and loyal patients, and 4) optimize clinician productivity while deploying HIT solutions, 5) support frictionless interoperability.\nOur core strategy is to become a trusted partner to our clients as they embark on their value-based journey and begin to take on risk as part of value-based contracts. We understand that our clients are now faced with a more complex, rapidly changing practice environment and that the HIT solutions that support these endeavors must evolve to meet these challenging requirements. Providing our clients with a comprehensive multi-faceted platform and accompanying services to enable their success is the key to our strategy.\nBased on current market trends, our strategic priorities are:\n \u2022 Focus on Ambulatory Care. We create for and invest in the specific needs of ambulatory care providers, giving us a distinct competitive advantage in our target market over solution providers who focus on hospitals first. While many of our competitors spread their R&D and localization investment across global regions, NextGen Healthcare maintains an exclusive focus on U.S.-only ambulatory practices. \n \u2022 Provide an integrated ambulatory care platform with superb scalability, flexibility and interoperability. Many healthcare challenges are uniquely local or regional -- our platform and capabilities flex and scale to fit our clients' practices and workflows, not the other way around. Our ability to interoperate is pervasive, allowing our clients to exchange data seamlessly. \n \u2022 Enable groups to successfully take on risk. We provide our clients with cloud-based population health tools that consume multi-sourced agnostic data, including adjudicated claims and risk stratification, care management tools, cost and utilization reporting, as well as quality measurement and reporting tools. Population health insights are delivered in core clinical and financial workflows enabling care givers to better engage their patients. \nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the

licensing rights and subscriptions to our software solutions, hardware and third-party software products, support and maintenance, managed services (formerly referred to as revenue cycle management and related services), electronic data interchange and data services ( EDI\u201d), and other non-recurring services, including implementation, training, and consulting services performed for clients who use our products.\nConsolidated revenue for the year ended March 31, 2019 decreased $1.8 million compared to the prior year due to a $2.3 million decrease in recurring revenues, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in software, hardware and other non-recurring revenues. The decrease in recurring revenues was due to $15.1 million lower managed services revenue and $3.0 million lower support and maintenance revenue, partially offset by $11.2 million higher subscriptions and $4.6 million higher EDI services revenue. A decrease of approximately $12.5 million in managed services is attributed to the adoption of ASC 606, whereby a portion of service fees associated with revenue cycle management ( RCM\u201d) arrangements are now classified within other revenue categories, such as subscription services, support and maintenance, and software license and hardware. Managed services revenue further decreased compared to the prior year due to higher levels of client attrition experienced in recent periods. The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in $7.5 million higher subscription services revenue and $5.3 million higher support and maintenance revenue, which were partially offset by lower revenue due to higher client attrition during the year. EDI revenue increased due to higher EDI services sold with our NextGen Office cloud-based solutions and growth in EDI transaction volume due to the addition of new clients and further penetration of our existing client base as well as incremental revenues earned from the sales of certain clinical data. Total software, hardware, and other non-recurring revenue increased approximately $1.4 million due to the adoption of ASC 606, partially offset by $1.0 million lower revenue based on lower demand from our clients for our software products and related implementation services.\nConsolidated revenue for the year ended March 31, 2018 increased $21.4 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2017, due to a $27.9 million increase in recurring revenues, offset by a $6.5 million decrease in non-recurring revenues. The increase in recurring revenues was due to a $12.2 million increase in subscription services, $6.9 million increase in managed services revenue, $5.0 million increase in support and maintenance, and $3.8 million increase in EDI revenue. Subscription revenues increased due to higher sales of our NextGen Office cloud-based subscriptions, and incremental sales of our NextGen Mobile and NextGen Population Health cloud-based solutions acquired from Entrada in April 2017 and EagleDream in August 2017, respectively. Managed services revenue benefit from higher RCM services revenue from the addition of new clients and organic growth achieved through cross selling and ramping up of RCM services provided to our existing clients, which was offset by customer attrition as well as higher sales of our hosting services. The increase in support and maintenance is primarily due to lower sales credits in the current year, addition of new customers, and the impact of our annual price increases. EDI revenue increased due to higher EDI services sold with our NextGen Office cloud-based solutions and growth in EDI transaction volume due to the addition of new clients and further penetration of our existing client base. The decrease in non-recurring revenue was due to lower software license and hardware revenue, partially offset by an increase in other non-recurring services. The decline in software license and hardware reflects lower recent bookings associated with the increasingly saturated end-market for electronic health records software and our transition to a recurring subscription-based model. The increase in other non-recurring services is primarily due to an increase in consulting service and other professional services based on demand from our customers.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nThe following table presents our consolidated cost of revenue and gross profit for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recurring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 191,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 194,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 179,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software, hardware, and other non-recurring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of capitalized software costs and acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 246,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 241,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 223,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 282,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 289,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 286,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue consists primarily of compensation expense, including share-based compensation, for personnel that deliver our products and services. Cost of revenue also includes amortization of capitalized software costs and acquired technology, third party consultant and outsourcing costs, costs associated with our EDI business partners and clearinghouses, hosting service costs, third party software costs and royalties, and other costs directly associated with delivering our products and services. Refer to Note 7, \"Intangible Assets\" and Note 8, \"Capitalized Software Costs\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on current period amortization of capitalized software costs and acquired technology and an estimate of future expected amortization.\nShare-based compensation expense included in cost of revenue was $1.3 million, $0.9 million, and $0.5 million for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and is included in the amounts in the table above.\nGross profit for the year ended March 31, 2019 decreased $7.0 million compared to the prior year due to the $1.8 million lower revenues discussed above, combined with an increase of $5.2 million in cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is primarily the result of $6.4 million higher amortization of previously capitalized software development costs and higher\namortization of the software technology intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of EagleDream in August 2017 and Inforth in January 2018 and higher costs of software, hardware and other non-recurring revenues due to increased third party and consulting costs associated with higher related revenues, which was partially offset by lower cost of recurring revenue due to lower headcount associated with delivering our support and maintenance services. Our gross margin percentage decreased to 53.4% for the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to 54.5% in the prior year period primarily due to the higher amortization of previously capitalized software development costs and higher amortization of the software technology intangible assets described above.\nGross profit for the year ended March 31, 2018 increased $3.0 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 due to the $21.4 million higher revenues discussed above, combined with an increase of $18.4 million in cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is primarily the result of higher costs associated with the acquisitions of Entrada in April 2017 and EagleDream in August 2017, higher amortization of the software technology intangible assets associated with our recent acquisitions, higher EDI vendor costs associated with higher transaction volumes, and higher personnel costs associated with delivering our support and maintenance and managed services, partially offset by lower amortization of previously capitalized software development cost. The decrease in our gross margin percentage to 54.5% for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to 56.2% in the year ended March 31, 2017 primarily reflects the decline in our high margin software revenue as noted above, partially offset by improvements in the profitability of our professional services driven by the growth in sales described above.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nThe following table presents our consolidated selling, general and administrative expense for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 164,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 193,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative, as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expense consist of compensation expense, including share-based compensation, for management and administrative personnel, selling and marketing expense, facilities costs, depreciation, professional service fees, including legal and accounting services, legal settlements, acquisition and transaction-related costs, and other general corporate and administrative expenses.\nShare-based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses was $11.9 million, $9.2 million, and $6.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and is included in the amounts in the table above. The increase in share-based compensation expense for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 compared to the preceding years are due to increased utilization of share-based awards to incentivize our executives and employees. Refer to Note 13, \"Share-Based Awards\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on equity award grants.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $28.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to a $5.7 million net benefit recorded in the current year from insurance recoveries related to the settlement of the Federal Securities Class Action complaint, compared to $19.0 million accrued at the end of the prior year for the preliminary settlement of the complaint (refer to Note 14, Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information). Selling, general and administrative expenses further decreased by approximately $6.8 million due to lower commissions and related benefits expense as a result of the adoption of ASC 606 (refer to Note 3, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d for additional information) and decreased due to lower legal related and consulting costs, which were partially offset by increases personnel costs, including share-based compensation, and higher communication costs. In the prior year, we incurred higher legal fees in defense of our securities litigation complaints and higher consulting costs associated with our adoption of the new revenue standard (ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers), including implementation of a new accounting system module.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $29.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 primarily due to higher incremental costs associated with our acquisitions of Entrada in April 2017 EagleDream in August 2017, higher personnel costs, including share-based compensation, higher advertising and marketing expense related to our rebranding efforts, higher consulting costs associated with our adoption of the new revenue standard, higher legal expense, and an accrual of $19.0 million for the preliminary settlement of the Federal Securities Class Action complaint, offset by $3.8 million of fair value adjustments related to the HealthFusion contingent consideration recorded in the year ended March 31, 2017.\nResearch and Development Costs, net\nThe following table presents our consolidated net research and development costs, capitalized software costs, and gross expenditures prior to capitalization, for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized software costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20,571\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,865\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,249\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 81,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development costs, as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized software costs as a percentage of gross expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross research and development expenditures, including costs expensed and costs capitalized, consist of compensation expense, including share-based compensation for research and development personnel, certain third-party consultant fees, software maintenance costs, and other costs related to new product development and enhancement to our existing products. We intend to continue to invest heavily in research and development expenses as we continue to bring additional functionality and features to the medical community and develop a new integrated inpatient and outpatient, web-based software platform.\nThe capitalization of software development costs results in a reduction to our reported net research and development costs. Our software capitalization rate, or capitalized software costs as a percentage of gross expenditures, has varied historically and may continue to vary based on the nature and status of specific projects and initiatives in progress. Although changes in software capitalization rates have no impact on our overall cash flows, it results in fluctuations in the amount of software development costs being expensed up front and the amount of net research and development costs reported in our consolidated statement of net income and comprehensive income.\nShare-based compensation expense included in research and development costs was $2.9 million, $2.0 million, and $1.0 million for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and is included in the amounts in the table above.\nNet research and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2019 decreased $0.3 million compared to the prior year due to a $1.4 million increase in our gross expenditures, offset by $1.7 million in higher capitalization of software costs. The increase in gross expenditures is primarily the result of incremental costs incurred for the development of the next versions of our software products and enhancements to our existing products, including increased hosting fees, higher utilization of our Bangalore development center resources, and increased share-based compensation expense, as noted above, which were partially offset by lower consulting and outside services costs and lower personnel costs due to reductions in our headcount.\nOur software capitalization rate fluctuates due to differences in the nature and status of our projects and initiatives during a given year, which affects the amount of development costs that may be capitalized and ultimately also affects the future amortization of our previously capitalized software development costs.\nNet research and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2018 increased $2.9 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 due to a $13.5 million increase in our gross expenditures, offset by $10.6 million in higher capitalization of software costs. The increase in both gross expenditures and capitalization of software costs are related to the development of the next major versions of our core software products and enhancements to our existing products, for which we incurred a higher personnel and third party development costs. Additionally, gross expenditures increased due to the incremental costs associated with the acquisition of Entrada in April 2017 and growth in our research and development headcount.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets\nThe following table presents our amortization of acquired intangible assets for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets included in operating expense consist of the amortization related to our customer relationships, trade name, and contracts intangible assets acquired as part of our business combinations. Refer to Note 7, \"Intangible Assets\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for an estimate of future expected amortization.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2019 decreased $3.5 million, compared to the prior year period due to certain acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the year and decreased amortization as a result of the impairment of our acquired trade names intangible assets in the prior year, as described further within the Impairment of Assets\u201d section below.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2018 decreased $2.6 million, compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 due to certain acquired intangible assets being fully amortized during the year, partially offset by the incremental amortization associated with intangible assets acquired from Inforth, EagleDream and Entrada.\nImpairment of Assets\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2018, we recorded an impairment of $3.8 million to our acquired trade names intangible assets that is reflected within the impairment of assets caption in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income. The impairment was the result of the elimination of certain legacy brand and trade names due to the launching of our new branding, identity, and corporate logo intended to reflect our expanded health technology portfolio following years of recent acquisitions.\nRestructuring Costs\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2017, as part of our corporate restructuring plan, we recorded $7.1 million of restructuring costs within operating expenses in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income. The restructuring costs consisted primarily of payroll-related costs, such as severance, outplacement costs, and continuing healthcare coverage, associated with the involuntary separation of employees pursuant to a one-time benefit arrangement, which were accrued when it was probable that the benefits would be paid and the amounts were reasonably estimable. The restructuring plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2017. Refer to Note 15, \"Restructuring Plan\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information.\nAlso included in restructuring costs were certain facilities-related costs associated with accruals for the remaining lease obligations at certain locations, including Solana Beach, Costa Mesa, and a portion of Horsham with contractual lease terms ending between January 2018 and September 2023. We have vacated each of the locations or portions thereof and are actively marketing the locations for sublease. We estimated the remaining lease obligations at fair value as of the cease-use date for each location based on the future contractual lease obligations, reduced by projected sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the locations after a period of marketing, and adjusted for the effect deferred rents that have been recognized under the lease. The effect of discounting future cash flows using a credit-adjusted risk free rate was not significant. Sublease income and commencement dates were estimated based on data available from rental activity in the local markets. Significant judgment was required to estimate the remaining lease obligations at fair value and actual results could vary from the estimates, resulting in potential future adjustments to amounts previously recorded.\nWe recorded $0.6 million of restructuring costs related to adjustments to the estimated fair value of remaining lease obligations in each of the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. As of March 31, 2019, and March 31, 2018, the remaining lease obligation, net of estimated projected sublease rentals, was $1.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Refer to Note 14, \"Commitments, Guarantees, and Contingencies,\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for estimated timing of payments related to remaining lease obligations.\nInterest Expense\nThe following table presents our interest expense for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,814\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,323\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,156\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (262\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense relates to our revolving credit agreement and the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs.

Interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2018 increased $0.2 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2017. The changes in interest expense is primarily caused by fluctuations in outstanding balances under our revolving credit agreement and the related amortization of debt issuance costs.\nAs of March 31, 2019, we had $11.0 million in outstanding loans under the revolving credit agreement.\nProvision for (Benefit of) Income Taxes\nThe following table presents our provision for (benefit of) income taxes for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for (benefit of) income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,830\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 690.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe change in the effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period was driven primarily by the increase in pretax income for the current year, which was mostly offset by the release of uncertain tax position reserves for the year ended March 31, 2018.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we completed our analysis of the new tax reform legislation, which was enacted December 22, 2017, and recorded a net tax benefit in the tax provision. We consider the accounting for the income tax effects of the new tax reform legislation to be complete and all adjustments to the provisional estimates have been finalized. The recorded impacts of the tax reform legislation are based on our current knowledge, interpretation, and assumptions. Refer to Note 11, \"Income Taxes\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for more information.\nThe change in the effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 was driven primarily by a decrease in pretax income. The effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2018 also benefitted from an increase in the research and development tax credit, the release of uncertain tax position reserves, and a benefit from the lower federal tax rate, which was partially offset by the tax reform's elimination of the qualified production activities deduction, effective April 1, 2018, and a one-time revaluation of deferred taxes and a foreign transition tax resulting from the tax reform legislation.\nNet Income\nThe following table presents our net income (in thousands) and net income per share and for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income per share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of the foregoing changes in revenue and expense, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 increased $22.1 million compared to the prior year period.\nAs a result of the foregoing changes in revenue and expense, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 decreased $15.8 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents selected financial statistics and information for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unused portion of revolving credit agreement (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 289,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 263,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 235,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 322,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 291,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 272,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) As of March 31, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings of $11.0 million under our $300.0 million revolving credit agreement. \nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash generated from operations, driven mostly by our net income and working capital management, our cash and cash equivalents, and our revolving credit agreement.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of March 31, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents balance of $33.1 million compares to $28.8 million as of March 31, 2018.\nOur outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement was $11.0 million as of March 31, 2019 compared to $37.0 million as of March 31, 2018.\nWe may continue to use a portion of our funds as well as available financing from our revolving credit agreement for future acquisitions or other similar business activities, although the specific timing and amount of funds to be used is not currently determinable. We intend to expend some of our available funds for the development of products complementary to our existing product line as well as new versions of certain of our products. These developments are intended to take advantage of more powerful technologies and to increase the integration of our products.\nOur investment policy is determined by our Board of Directors. Excess cash, if any, may be invested in very liquid short term assets including tax exempt and taxable money market funds, certificates of deposit and short term municipal bonds with average maturities of 365 days or less at the time of purchase. Our Board of Directors continues to review alternate uses for our cash including an expansion of our investment policy and other items. Any or all of these programs could significantly impact our investment income in future periods.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at March 31, 2019, together with our cash flows from operations and liquidity provided by our revolving credit agreement, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash from net income, as adjusted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 91,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in contract assets and liabilities, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,943\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,493\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in accounts receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,178\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,409\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in other assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29,550\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities decreased $23.6 million compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributed to a decrease of $40.9 million from net changes in other assets and liabilities and a decrease of $6.6 million from net changes in accounts receivable and contract balances, offset by an increase of $23.9 million due to higher net income, as adjusted for non-cash expenses. The net decrease in cash from changes in other assets and liabilities was mostly related to the current year settlement of the Federal Securities Class Action complaint that was accrued in the prior year and higher capitalization of commissions costs associated with the adoption of ASC 606 (refer to Note 3, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information), which was partially offset by a net increase in cash from changes in income taxes receivable and payable.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, cash provided by operating activities decreased $36.1 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in cash flows was primarily due to a decrease of $18.4 million from net changes in other assets and liabilities, of which $43.3 million was associated with changes in income taxes receivable and payable, offset by an accrual of $19.0 million for a preliminary settlement of the Federal Securities Class Action complaint (refer to Note 14, Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information), and higher deferred rents and accruals for remaining lease obligations of our vacated properties. Net cash provided from net income, as adjusted for non-cash expenses, decreased $13.1 million primarily due to $15.8 million decrease in net income, offset by higher non-cash expenses during the year ended March 31, 2018. The increase in non-cash expenses was driven by changes in deferred taxes, higher share-based compensation, and impairment of assets recorded during the year ended March 31, 2018, offset by lower"}
