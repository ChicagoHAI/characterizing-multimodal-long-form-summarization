Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and related notes.\nINTRODUCTION\nCompany Overview\nWe are a leading transportation and logistics services company providing a broad portfolio of premier truckload, intermodal, and logistics solutions and operating one of the largest for-hire trucking fleets in North America. Our highly flexible and balanced business combines asset-based truckload services with asset-light intermodal and non-asset logistics offerings, enabling us to serve our customers' diverse transportation needs.\nStrategy\nOur goals are to grow revenue and profitability, drive strong and consistent return on capital, and increase stakeholder value resiliently through economic cycles. We believe our competitive strengths position us to pursue our goals by way of the following strategies:\nStrengthen core operations to drive organic growth and maintain a leading market position\nWe intend to drive organic growth through leveraging our existing customer relationships, as well as expanding our customer base. We believe our broad portfolio of services with different asset intensities and our North American footprint, allow for supply chain alternatives which enable new and existing customer growth with the potential to capture a greater share of each customers' annual transportation and logistics spend. We also plan to drive revenue growth by increasing our marketing to customers that seek to outsource their transportation services. Our growth decisions are based on our Value Triangle\u201d, which represents profitable growth while balancing the needs of our customers, our associates, and our shareholders. Our Quest platform serves as an instrumental factor which drives profitability as it enables real-time, data-driven decision support science on every load/order, and assists our associates to proactively manage our services across our network. Together with our highly incentivized and proactive sales organization, our Quest platform will provide better service and organic growth in each of our reportable segments.\nExpand capabilities in the specialty equipment freight market and continue growing our asset-light and non-asset businesses\nWe believe that our specialty freight capabilities position us to grow in the specialty equipment market, which has higher barriers to entry and favors enhanced pricing and lasting customer relationships. The complexity and time-sensitivity of the loads often require increased collaboration with, and greater understanding of, our customers' business needs and processes. The transportation of specialty equipment freight requires specially trained drivers with appropriate licenses and special hauling permits, as well as equipment that can handle items with unique requirements in terms of temperature, freight treatment, size, and shape. As such, there are few carriers that have comparable network scale and capabilities in the specialty equipment market, which we believe will allow us to grow profitably in that business.\nWe have seen strong growth in our Intermodal business and expect it will continue. As an asset-based provider we have more control over our equipment to include containers and chassis, perform most of our own drays, and have strong contractual rail relationships. We believe our Quest platform will enable us to enjoy certain benefits of complete end-to-end control, including increased pick-up and delivery predictability, better visibility, and more capacity when driver capacity is constrained.\nFreight brokerage, which is a significant part of our Logistics segment, is another business where we have seen strong growth, which we expect will continue. As shippers increasingly consolidate their business with fewer freight brokers, we are well-positioned to become one of their select providers due to our customer service, innovative technology, and an established dense network of qualified third-party carriers. Large shippers in particular see the value of working with providers like us that have scale, capacity, and lane density, as they are more reliable, efficient, and cost effective at covering loads. Brokerage serves as a non-asset innovation hub for Schneider, particularly in the areas of predictive analytics, process automation, and new customer relationship generation.\nCapitalize on the growth of e-commerce fulfillment\nAs a first, middle, and final mile\u201d carrier for large parcel consumer items, such as furniture, appliances, electronics, and mattresses, in one of the fastest-growing e-commerce markets, we are positioned to grow. We have the technological capability, national footprint, and the ability to use multiple modes of capacity to provide network breadth and density to meet growing e-commerce fulfillment needs. We provide services for many online retailers, offering first to final mile delivery from warehouses to consumer living rooms. We intend to leverage our end-market expertise, leading technology platform, density, and end-to-end integrated capabilities to continue taking the complexity out of the supply chain for omni-channel retailers, further driving our growth.\nContinue to improve our operations and margins by leveraging benefits from investments in our Quest technology and business transformation\nWe continue to benefit from our Quest technology and business transformation by improving the effectiveness with which we use data to increase revenue and lower costs. Full visibility into each driver's profile allows us to increase driver satisfaction and retention by matching drivers to loads and routes that better fit their individual needs. We can improve our customer service, retain drivers, lower costs, and generate business by anticipating our customers' and drivers' needs and preferences in a dynamic network. We believe the implementation of simple and intuitive customer interfaces will also enable a stronger connection with our customers through increased interaction and an enhanced user experience. We expect additional margin improvement as we continue to leverage data analytics within the Quest platform. Along with our revenue management discipline, the strong foundation we have established with our continuing Quest transformation will allow us to incorporate new technologies and build additional capabilities into the platform over time, maintaining our competitive edge and setting the foundation for future growth.\nAllocate capital across businesses to maximize return on capital, and selectively pursue opportunistic acquisitions\nOur broad portfolio of services provides us with a greater opportunity to allocate capital within our portfolio of services in a manner that maximizes returns across all market cycles and economic conditions. For example, we can efficiently move our equipment between services and regions when we see opportunities to maximize our return on capital. We continually monitor our performance and market conditions to ensure appropriate allocation of capital and resources to grow our businesses, while optimizing returns across reportable segments. Furthermore, our strong balance sheet enables us to carry out an acquisition strategy that strengthens our overall portfolio. We are positioned to leverage our scalable platform and experienced operations team to acquire high-quality businesses that meet our disciplined selection criteria to broaden our service offerings and customer base.\nAttract and retain top talent at all levels to ensure sustainable growth\nOur people are our strongest assets, and we believe they are key to growing our customer base and driving our performance. Our goal is to be the employer of choice; attract, develop, engage, and retain the best talent in the industry. We strive for a high-performance culture with operational excellence and to foster a collaborative environment which seeks individuals who are passionate about our business and fit within our culture. We value the direct relationship we have with our associates, and we intend to continue working together to provide professional growth and a quality work environment without third party representation. Our compensation structure is performance-based and aligns with our strategic objectives. In today's driver constrained environment, we seek to maintain our reputation as a preferred carrier of choice within the driver community and attract and retain high-quality, safe drivers that meet or exceed our qualification standards. We invest in the well-being of our associates through our commitment to ensuring a differentiated driver experience and efforts to improve the quality of drivers' touchpoints. We provide mandatory physical check-ups which cover sleep apnea and urine and hair follicle drug testing, among other things. We believe that investing in the health of our associates helps maintain a high-quality driver base.\nOur leading technology platform facilitates the application, screening, and onboarding of top talent. As an industry leader with a respected safety culture and underlying core values, we believe that we will continue to be the employer of choice for both driving and non-driving associates.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this section of our report we present the following non-GAAP financial measures: (1) revenues (excluding fuel surcharge), (2) adjusted income from operations, (3) adjusted operating ratio, (4) adjusted net income, and (5) adjusted effective tax rate. We also provide reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement believes the use of each of these non-GAAP measures assists investors in understanding our business by (a) removing the impact of items from our operating results that, in our opinion, do not reflect our core operating performance, (b) providing investors with the same information our management uses internally to assess our core operating performance, and (c) presenting comparable financial results between periods. In addition, in the case of revenues (excluding fuel surcharge), we believe the measure is useful to investors because it isolates volume, price, and cost changes directly related to industry demand and the way we operate our business from the external factor of fluctuating fuel prices and the programs we have in place to manage fuel price fluctuations. Fuel-related costs and their impact on our industry are important to our results of operations, but they are often independent of other, more germane factors affecting our results of operations and our industry. Although we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, they have limitations as analytical tools and may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies. You should not consider the non-GAAP measures in this report in isolation or as substitutes for, or alternatives to, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. The exclusion of unusual or infrequent items or other adjustments reflected in the non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will not be affected by unusual or infrequent items or by other items similar to such adjustments. Our management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results in addition to using the non-GAAP measures.\nEnterprise Summary\nThe following table includes key GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for the consolidated enterprise.\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except ratios)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,977.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,383.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,045.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,454.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,997.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,751.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>290.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted income from operations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>383.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>281.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>293.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating ratio (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>268.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net income (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>275.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted effective tax rate (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>We define revenues (excluding fuel surcharge)\u201d as operating revenues less fuel surcharge revenues.

Increased revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) resulted from strong pricing and volume increases in the Logistics and Intermodal segments, which increased $190.3 million and $173.6 million, respectively, driven by an industry-wide shortage in driver capacity and increased customer demand.

The largest contributor to improved profitability was the Intermodal segment, which was due in part to an improved cost position from the conversion from leased to owned chassis and growth from investments in containers. These factors were partially offset by increased purchased transportation and driver related costs, as well as increased FTFM losses in 2018.\nAdjusted income from operations increased $101.9 million, approximately 36%.\nEnterprise operating ratio improved on both a GAAP basis and an adjusted basis. Our operating ratio can be negatively impacted when our lower margin, less asset-focused Logistics segment grows faster than our higher margin, capital-intensive Truckload segment.\nEnterprise Operating Expenses\nKey operating expense items that impacted our income from operations are described below.\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Purchased transportation costs increased $360.6 million, or 22%, year over year.

See Note 6, Investments, for more information on Platform Science. These items were partially offset by a $2.4 million increase in net foreign currency losses.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur provision for income taxes increased $222.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 offset by higher taxable income in 2018. Our effective income tax rate was 26.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to (48.0)% for 2017, due to the reduction in the income tax rate and the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Job Act in December 2017. We anticipate that our ongoing effective tax rate will be 25.5% - 26.5% subject to further changes in law.\nSegment Contributions to Income from Operations\nThe following tables summarize revenue and

The growth in revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) cited above was partially offset by increased third-party transportation costs and increased seller and broker commissions due to improved operating results.\nOther\nOur Other segment's loss from operations increased $39.9 million year over year. The $39.9 million increase was driven by the year over year $13.5 million reduction of a contingent liability from the WSL acquisition in 2017 resulting in decreased costs, an increase in incentive compensation due to improved enterprise results, and the $5.8 million settlement of a lawsuit that challenged Washington State labor law compliance. An increase in professional services fees, including additional costs associated with operating as a public company, and Asia goodwill impairment charges of $2.0 million also contributed to the increased loss from operations in our Other segment.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nEnterprise Results Summary\nEnterprise net income increased $233.0 million, approximately 149%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. We recorded a $229.5 million favorable adjustment to our net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the decrease in the federal income tax rate effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. We also recorded\nan $8.1 million after-tax adjustment to a contingent liability related to the WSL acquisition, resulting in a favorable impact on net income.\nAdjusted net income increased $2.7 million, approximately 2%. Higher volumes across all of our segments, productivity improvements, and lower interest expense were partially offset by lower gains on sales of equipment and higher driver and fuel costs.\nComponents of Enterprise Net Income\nEnterprise Revenues\nEnterprise operating revenues increased $337.9 million, approximately 8%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016.

See Note 4, Acquisition, and Note 5, Fair Value, for more information on the contingent liability adjustment.\nAdjusted income from operations decreased $11.4 million, approximately 4%. This decrease was primarily driven by the lower gains on sales of equipment mentioned above, as well as increased driver and fuel costs. The majority of our operating costs, with the exception of driver costs and fuel costs, increased in line with the increase in revenues.\nEnterprise operating ratio increased on both a GAAP basis and an adjusted basis. In addition to the decrease in income from operations year over year, our operating ratio was negatively impacted due to changes in our mix of business when our lower margin, less asset-focused Logistics segment grows faster than our higher margin, capital-intensive Truckload segment.\nEnterprise Operating Expenses\nKey operating expense items that impacted our income from operations are described below.\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Purchased transportation costs increased $139.3 million, or 10%, year over year.

December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to $58.7 million more revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) from WSL (which was acquired in June 2016), as well as growth in Dedicated Specialty accounts, partially offset by decreased freight volumes in our Dedicated Standard and For-hire Standard businesses. Effective freight selection in a strengthening market in the second half of 2017, truck productivity improvements throughout the year, and a favorable year over year price impact resulted in an increase in revenue per truck per week of $131, approximately 4%, over 2016.\nTruckload income from operations decreased $24.9 million, approximately 11%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased driver costs, increased FTFM network buildout costs, the net negative impact of two major hurricanes in the third quarter of 2017, and lower gains on sales of equipment, partially offset by operational efficiencies driven by effective fleet sizing and freight selection.\nIntermodal\nThe following table presents our key performance indicators for our intermodal segment for the periods indicated.\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Orders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>408,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>381,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Containers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trucks (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per order (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating ratio (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes company trucks and owner-operator trucks at the end of the period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Calculated excluding fuel surcharge, consistent with how revenue is reported internally for segment purposes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Calculated as segment operating expenses divided by segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIntermodal revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased $22.4 million, approximately 3%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was driven by 7% higher volumes, partially offset by a 4% decrease in revenue per order due to both the competitive pricing environment for most of 2017 and growth in the East, which has a shorter length of haul.\nIntermodal income from operations increased $6.2 million, approximately 13%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared 2016. The increase was driven by higher volumes and tractor and container productivity improvements, partially offset by the increase in duplicate costs due to the 2017 chassis conversion project.

The growth in revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) cited above was partially offset by increased third-party transportation costs.\nOther\nOur Other segment's expense from operations decreased $5.1 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, driven primarily by the $13.5 million adjustment of a contingent liability from the WSL acquisition. This decrease was partially offset by higher auto insurance losses year over year and higher professional fees, primarily for transition costs related to public company requirements.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary uses of cash are working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements. Additionally, from time to time, we may use cash for acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. Working capital is required principally to ensure we are able to run the business and have sufficient funds to satisfy maturing short-term debt and operational expenses. Our capital expenditures consist primarily of transportation equipment and information technology.\nHistorically, our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations. In addition, we have a $250.0 million revolving credit facility and a $200.0 million accounts receivable facility. We anticipate that cash generated from operations, together with amounts available under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that these funds will be obtained through additional indebtedness, additional equity offerings, or a combination of these potential sources of funds. Our ability to fund future operating expenses and capital expenditures, as well as our ability to meet future debt service obligations or refinance our indebtedness, will depend on our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, and other factors beyond our control.\nThe following table presents our cash and debt outstanding as of the dates shown.\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>378.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>430.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment financing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>411.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>440.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Debt on our consolidated balance sheets is presented net of deferred financing costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt\nAt December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios under our credit agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in income before taxes of $101.2 million.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nCash provided by operating activities increased $6.0 million, approximately 1%, during 2017 compared to 2016, driven by the timing of cash payables and other individually insignificant items.\nInvesting Activities\n2018 Compared to 2017\nCash used in investing activities decreased $52.9 million, approximately 14%, during 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease was driven by increased proceeds from the sale of equipment and lease receipts, offset by increased purchases of marketable securities.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nCash used in investing activities decreased $122.8 million, approximately 24%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The main driver of the decrease in cash used was the impact of the June 2016 acquisition of WSL, which resulted in a net cash outflow of $78.2 million in 2016. The remaining decrease in cash used was driven by lower transportation equipment purchases in 2017.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our net capital expenditures.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>385.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>388.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>422.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from sale of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>331.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>351.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>407.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnnual transportation equipment purchases have decreased since 2016. Our expenditures were higher in 2016 in order to reduce average tractor age within the fleet, which resulted in lower 2017 and 2018 replacements, and also to take advantage of a strong used tractor and trailer market. In addition, in 2016 we had an initiative to grow trailer count in order to reduce unbilled miles.\nWe currently anticipate net capital expenditures in 2019 to be approximately $340 million.\nFinancing Activities\n2018 Compared to 2017\nCash used in financing activities in 2018 was $88.7 million compared to cash provided by financing activities in 2017 of $36.9 million resulting in a decrease of $125.6 million in cash provided by financing activities. We received approximately $341.0 million of proceeds from our IPO in April 2017 which was partially offset by 2017 one-time payments on the revolver and private placement debt of $235.0 million. In 2018, four quarterly dividend payments at $0.06 per outstanding share were made compared to only three payments at $0.05 per outstanding share in 2017, resulting in a $15.2 million increased use of cash.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nCash provided by financing activities increased $8.8 million, approximately 31%, during 2017 compared to 2016. We received approximately $341.0 million of proceeds from our IPO in April 2017, and we paid $5.8 million less in dividends year over year because our fourth quarter 2017 dividend was paid in January 2018.

Recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers is challenging in an increasingly competitive driver market and has a significant impact on our operating costs and ability to serve our customers. Changes in the demographic composition of the workforce, alternative employment opportunities that become available in the economy, and individual drivers' desire to be home more frequently can affect availability of drivers, including by increasing the wages our drivers require.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no arrangements that meet the definition of off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Amounts Committed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt principal and interest obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>461.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>265.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>265.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WSL guaranteed payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized tax benefits (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>861.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>386.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes unsecured senior notes and equipment financing notes\n(2) Includes firm commitments to purchase transportation equipment\n(3) This amount is shown in the other column because the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated. See Note 10, Income Taxes, for additional information.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that management make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Therefore, these estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities. Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, using historical experience, consultation with third parties, and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. Any effects on our business, financial position, or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nThe estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm.\nClaims Accruals\nReserves are established based on estimated or expected losses for claims. The primary claims arising for the Company consist of accident-related claims for personal injury, collision, and comprehensive compensation, in addition to workers' compensation and cargo liability. We maintain self-insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self-insured liabilities. We also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of the self-insurance amounts.\nThe reserves represent accruals for the estimated self-insured and re-insured portions of pending claims, including adverse development of known claims, as well as incurred but not reported claims. Our estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of the claim, historical trends, advice from third-party administrators and insurers, consultation with actuarial experts, the specific facts of individual cases, the jurisdictions involved, estimates of future claims development, and the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims. The actual cost to settle our self-insured claim liabilities can differ from our reserve estimates because of a number of uncertainties, including the inherent difficulty in estimating the severity of a claim and the potential amount to defend and settle a claim. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had an accrual of approximately $156.0 million and $147.2 million, respectively, for estimated claims net of reinsurance receivables.\nWe have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims. If there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed, or any of the claims would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage, our profitability would be adversely affected. In addition to estimates within our self-insured retention, we also must make judgments concerning our coverage limits. If any claim were to exceed our coverage limits, we would have to accrue for the excess amount. Our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and, if so, by how much. Currently, we are not aware of any such claims. If one or more claims were to exceed our effective coverage limits, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nDepreciation of Property and Equipment\nWe operate a significant number of trucks, trailers, containers, chassis, and other equipment in connection with our business and must select estimated useful lives and salvage values for calculating depreciation. Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated to an estimated salvage value using the straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful life. Depreciable lives of revenue equipment range from 2 to 20 years and are based on historical experience, as well as future expectations regarding the period we expect to benefit from the assets and company policies around maintenance and asset replacement. Estimates of salvage value at the expected date of sale are based on the expected market values of equipment at the expected time of disposal. We consider our experience with similar assets, conditions in the used revenue equipment market, and operational information such as average annual miles. We periodically review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and adjust these assumptions appropriately when warranted. We review our property and equipment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss equal to the excess of carrying amount over fair value would be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable.\nGoodwill\nTo expand our business offerings, we have, on occasion, acquired other companies. In a business combination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, based on estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, history, future expansion and profitability expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows, and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment at least annually, and more frequently if a triggering event indicates that impairment may exist.\nOur total goodwill balance at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $162.2 million and $164.8 million, respectively. Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit can be a segment or business within a segment. As of December 31, 2017, our reporting units with goodwill were Dedicated, Import/Export, and Asia. During 2018, we reorganized the structure of the operating segments within our Truckload reportable segment, separating FTFM into its own operating segment and integrating the remaining Dedicated business into the VTL operating segment. Each Truckload operating segment was determined to be its own reporting unit due to the level at which financial information is available and management's review of that information. As a result of the reorganization, goodwill previously attributed to the Dedicated reporting unit was reallocated to the VTL-Dedicated Services and FTFM reporting units on a relative fair value basis. Of the $138.2 million previously attributed to the Dedicated reporting unit, VTL-Dedicated Services and FTFM reporting units were allocated $103.6 million and $34.6 million, respectively. After the reallocation of goodwill, an impairment test was performed for these reporting units, and it was determined that, as of April 1, 2018, goodwill was not impaired as each reporting unit had an estimated fair value in excess of its respective carrying amount.\nIn the impairment evaluation, the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, is compared with its fair value. We base our fair value estimation on an independent valuation report, which uses a combination of (1) an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, and (2) a market approach based on market price data of shares of our company and others in our industry, to value our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,\nan impairment loss is recorded equal to that excess. Significant judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows. Assumptions used in impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain risks discussed earlier in this document.\nWe completed the required annual goodwill impairment test for all four of our reporting units with goodwill as of October 31, 2018. The fair values of our VTL-Dedicated Services and Import/Export reporting units were significantly in excess of their respective carrying values, while our Asia reporting unit had a carrying value in excess of its fair value. The Asia reporting unit's revenue is performing below expectations, however better than the previous year. The yuan, or CNY, continued to weaken in the fourth quarter, as trade tensions between the US and China escalated. There are ongoing discussions on current tariffs between the US and China that remain uncertain which have also had an impact on current market conditions in Asia. While our long-term growth rate remains unchanged from the prior year, we reassessed our Asia performance projections given the current market and economy in China. The operations of the Asia reporting unit are still projected to be favorable in the long-term based on the customer pipeline activity and carrier cost management, however this was not enough to recover the carrying value. As such, a goodwill impairment loss of $2.0 million was recorded for our Asia reporting unit. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining goodwill attributed to our Asia reporting unit was $9.8 million. Continued challenges for the Chinese economy and our inability to retain and attract profitable customers could result in future goodwill impairments for our Asia reporting unit. Key assumptions used in both the 2018 and 2017 Asia goodwill impairment analyses are as follows:\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Goodwill Assumptions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term growth rate (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The discount rate is based on the Company's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) which increased from the analysis performed in the prior year primarily due to an increase in the risk-free interest rate.

The decrease in fair value was primarily due to recent revenues not meeting projections and operational inefficiencies, which management is addressing through a revised comprehensive operating plan. This operating plan centers around reducing variability in the first and middle mile operations, converting more freight to intermodal, for-hire truck, and third-party capacity, as well as refining its commercial focus. While management has made adjustments to FTFM's operating plan, future financial performance that doesn't meet management expectations may result in the carrying value of this reporting unit exceeding its fair value which would result in an impairment of goodwill. Key assumptions used in each of the 2018 FTFM goodwill impairment analyses are as follows:\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FTFM Goodwill Assumptions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 1, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term growth rate (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The discount rate is based on the Company's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) which increased from the analysis performed earlier in 2018 primarily due to an increase in the risk-free interest rate.

If future operating performance of any of our reporting units is below our expectations or there are changes to forecasted growth rates or our cost of capital, a decline in the fair value of the reporting units could result, and we may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge. See Note 7, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, for more information.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, in accordance with ASC 740-10, Income Taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. If we ever estimated that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets will not be realized, we must establish a valuation allowance for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable. Accordingly, if the facts or financial results were to\nchange in such a way as to impact the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets, we would have to apply judgment to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in the appropriate period.\nWe recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits when the benefits of tax positions taken on a tax return are not likely to be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.

7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and related notes.\nINTRODUCTION\nCompany Overview\nWe are a leading transportation and logistics services company providing a broad portfolio of premier truckload, intermodal, and logistics solutions and operating one of the largest for-hire trucking fleets in North America. Our highly flexible and balanced business combines asset-based truckload services with asset-light intermodal and non-asset logistics offerings, enabling us to serve our customers' diverse transportation needs.\nStrategy\nOur goals are to grow revenue and profitability, drive strong and consistent return on capital, and increase stakeholder value resiliently through economic cycles. We believe our competitive strengths position us to pursue our goals by way of the following strategies:\nStrengthen core operations to drive organic growth and maintain a leading market position\nWe intend to drive organic growth through leveraging our existing customer relationships, as well as expanding our customer base. We believe our broad portfolio of services with different asset intensities and our North American footprint, allow for supply chain alternatives which enable new and existing customer growth with the potential to capture a greater share of each customers' annual transportation and logistics spend. We also plan to drive revenue growth by increasing our marketing to customers that seek to outsource their transportation services. Our growth decisions are based on our Value Triangle\u201d, which represents profitable growth while balancing the needs of our customers, our associates, and our shareholders. Our Quest platform serves as an instrumental factor which drives profitability as it enables real-time, data-driven decision support science on every load/order, and assists our associates to proactively manage our services across our network. Together with our highly incentivized and proactive sales organization, our Quest platform will provide better service and organic growth in each of our reportable segments.\nExpand capabilities in the specialty equipment freight market and continue growing our asset-light and non-asset businesses\nWe believe that our specialty freight capabilities position us to grow in the specialty equipment market, which has higher barriers to entry and favors enhanced pricing and lasting customer relationships. The complexity and time-sensitivity of the loads often require increased collaboration with, and greater understanding of, our customers' business needs and processes. The transportation of specialty equipment freight requires specially trained drivers with appropriate licenses and special hauling permits, as well as equipment that can handle items with unique requirements in terms of temperature, freight treatment, size, and shape. As such, there are few carriers that have comparable network scale and capabilities in the specialty equipment market, which we believe will allow us to grow profitably in that business.\nWe have seen strong growth in our Intermodal business and expect it will continue. As an asset-based provider we have more control over our equipment to include containers and chassis, perform most of our own drays, and have strong contractual rail relationships. We believe our Quest platform will enable us to enjoy certain benefits of complete end-to-end control, including increased pick-up and delivery predictability, better visibility, and more capacity when driver capacity is constrained.\nFreight brokerage, which is a significant part of our Logistics segment, is another business where we have seen strong growth, which we expect will continue. As shippers increasingly consolidate their business with fewer freight brokers, we are well-positioned to become one of their select providers due to our customer service, innovative technology, and an established dense network of qualified third-party carriers. Large shippers in particular see the value of working with providers like us that have scale, capacity, and lane density, as they are more reliable, efficient, and cost effective at covering loads. Brokerage serves as a non-asset innovation hub for Schneider, particularly in the areas of predictive analytics, process automation, and new customer relationship generation.\nCapitalize on the growth of e-commerce fulfillment\nAs a first, middle, and final mile\u201d carrier for large parcel consumer items, such as furniture, appliances, electronics, and mattresses, in one of the fastest-growing e-commerce markets, we are positioned to grow. We have the technological capability, national footprint, and the ability to use multiple modes of capacity to provide network breadth and density to meet growing e-commerce fulfillment needs. We provide services for many online retailers, offering first to final mile delivery from warehouses to consumer living rooms. We intend to leverage our end-market expertise, leading technology platform, density, and end-to-end integrated capabilities to continue taking the complexity out of the supply chain for omni-channel retailers, further driving our growth.\nContinue to improve our operations and margins by leveraging benefits from investments in our Quest technology and business transformation\nWe continue to benefit from our Quest technology and business transformation by improving the effectiveness with which we use data to increase revenue and lower costs. Full visibility into each driver's profile allows us to increase driver satisfaction and retention by matching drivers to loads and routes that better fit their individual needs. We can improve our customer service, retain drivers, lower costs, and generate business by anticipating our customers' and drivers' needs and preferences in a dynamic network. We believe the implementation of simple and intuitive customer interfaces will also enable a stronger connection with our customers through increased interaction and an enhanced user experience. We expect additional margin improvement as we continue to leverage data analytics within the Quest platform. Along with our revenue management discipline, the strong foundation we have established with our continuing Quest transformation will allow us to incorporate new technologies and build additional capabilities into the platform over time, maintaining our competitive edge and setting the foundation for future growth.\nAllocate capital across businesses to maximize return on capital, and selectively pursue opportunistic acquisitions\nOur broad portfolio of services provides us with a greater opportunity to allocate capital within our portfolio of services in a manner that maximizes returns across all market cycles and economic conditions. For example, we can efficiently move our equipment between services and regions when we see opportunities to maximize our return on capital. We continually monitor our performance and market conditions to ensure appropriate allocation of capital and resources to grow our businesses, while optimizing returns across reportable segments. Furthermore, our strong balance sheet enables us to carry out an acquisition strategy that strengthens our overall portfolio. We are positioned to leverage our scalable platform and experienced operations team to acquire high-quality businesses that meet our disciplined selection criteria to broaden our service offerings and customer base.\nAttract and retain top talent at all levels to ensure sustainable growth\nOur people are our strongest assets, and we believe they are key to growing our customer base and driving our performance. Our goal is to be the employer of choice; attract, develop, engage, and retain the best talent in the industry. We strive for a high-performance culture with operational excellence and to foster a collaborative environment which seeks individuals who are passionate about our business and fit within our culture. We value the direct relationship we have with our associates, and we intend to continue working together to provide professional growth and a quality work environment without third party representation. Our compensation structure is performance-based and aligns with our strategic objectives. In today's driver constrained environment, we seek to maintain our reputation as a preferred carrier of choice within the driver community and attract and retain high-quality, safe drivers that meet or exceed our qualification standards. We invest in the well-being of our associates through our commitment to ensuring a differentiated driver experience and efforts to improve the quality of drivers' touchpoints. We provide mandatory physical check-ups which cover sleep apnea and urine and hair follicle drug testing, among other things. We believe that investing in the health of our associates helps maintain a high-quality driver base.\nOur leading technology platform facilitates the application, screening, and onboarding of top talent. As an industry leader with a respected safety culture and underlying core values, we believe that we will continue to be the employer of choice for both driving and non-driving associates.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this section of our report we present the following non-GAAP financial measures: (1) revenues (excluding fuel surcharge), (2) adjusted income from operations, (3) adjusted operating ratio, (4) adjusted net income, and (5) adjusted effective tax rate. We also provide reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement believes the use of each of these non-GAAP measures assists investors in understanding our business by (a) removing the impact of items from our operating results that, in our opinion, do not reflect our core operating performance, (b) providing investors with the same information our management uses internally to assess our core operating performance, and (c) presenting comparable financial results between periods. In addition, in the case of revenues (excluding fuel surcharge), we believe the measure is useful to investors because it isolates volume, price, and cost changes directly related to industry demand and the way we operate our business from the external factor of fluctuating fuel prices and the programs we have in place to manage fuel price fluctuations. Fuel-related costs and their impact on our industry are important to our results of operations, but they are often independent of other, more germane factors affecting our results of operations and our industry. Although we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, they have limitations as analytical tools and may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies. You should not consider the non-GAAP measures in this report in isolation or as substitutes for, or alternatives to, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. The exclusion of unusual or infrequent items or other adjustments reflected in the non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will not be affected by unusual or infrequent items or by other items similar to such adjustments. Our management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results in addition to using the non-GAAP measures.\nEnterprise Summary\nThe following table includes key GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for the consolidated enterprise.\n\n (1) We define revenues (excluding fuel surcharge)\u201d as operating revenues less fuel surcharge revenues. Included below is a reconciliation of operating revenues, the most closely comparable GAAP financial measure, to revenues (excluding fuel surcharge). \n (2) We define adjusted income from operations\u201d as income from operations, adjusted to exclude material items that do not reflect our core operating performance. Included below is a reconciliation of income from operations, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted income from operations. Excluded items for the periods shown are explained in the table and notes below. \n (3) We define adjusted operating ratio\u201d as operating expenses, adjusted to exclude material items that do not reflect our core operating performance, divided by revenues (excluding fuel surcharge). Included below is a reconciliation of operating ratio, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted operating ratio. Excluded items for the periods shown are explained below under our explanation of adjusted income from operations.\u201d \n (4) We define adjusted net income\u201d as net income, adjusted to exclude material items that do not reflect our core operating performance. Included below is a reconciliation of net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net income. Excluded items for the periods shown are explained below under our explanation of adjusted income from operations.\u201d \n (5) Adjusted effective tax rate\u201d represents our effective tax rate prior to the effect on our deferred tax assets and liabilities of the change in the federal income tax rate due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Included below is a reconciliation of our effective tax rate, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to the adjusted effective tax rate. \nRevenues (excluding fuel surcharge)\n\nAdjusted income from operations\n\n (1) Costs associated with the settlement of a lawsuit that challenged Washington State labor law compliance during 2018. \n (2) As of December 31, 2017, we completed our migration to an owned chassis model, which required the replacement of rented chassis with owned chassis. Accordingly, we adjusted our income from operations for rental costs related to idle chassis as rental units were replaced. \n (3) In 2017, we recorded fair value adjustments to the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of WSL. See Note 4, Acquisition, and Note 5, Fair Value, for more information. \n (4) Costs related to the June 1, 2016 acquisition of WSL. \n (5) Costs related to our IPO. \n (6) As a result of our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded an impairment charge for our Asia reporting unit. \nAdjusted operating ratio\n\nAdjusted net income\n\n(1) This amount represents the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of the change in the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.\n (2) Tax impacts are calculated using the applicable consolidated federal and state effective tax rate, modified to remove the impact of tax credits and adjustments (such as the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017) that are not applicable to the item in question. If the underlying item has a materially different tax treatment, the actual or estimated tax rate applicable to the adjustment is used. A tax rate of 0% was used for the 2018 goodwill impairment. \nAdjusted effective tax rate\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nEnterprise Results Summary\nEnterprise net income decreased $121.0 million, approximately 31%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to a $229.5 million favorable adjustment to our net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, partially offset by strong pricing and market demand in 2018.\nAdjusted net income increased $114.0 million, approximately 71%.\nComponents of Enterprise Net Income\nEnterprise Revenues\nEnterprise operating revenues increased $593.4 million, approximately 14%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. Increased revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) resulted from strong pricing and volume increases in the Logistics and Intermodal segments, which increased $190.3 million and $173.6 million, respectively, driven by an industry-wide shortage in driver capacity and increased customer demand. Other factors contributing to the increase in revenues were as follows:\n \u2022 a $136.5 million increase in fuel surcharge revenues, and \n \u2022 a $80.6 million increase in our Truckload segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge), primarily due to price. \nEnterprise revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased $456.9 million, approximately 11%.\nEnterprise Income from Operations and Operating Ratio\nEnterprise income from operations increased $95.5 million, approximately 34%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in revenue and improved profitability across the segments. The largest contributor to improved profitability was the Intermodal segment, which was due in part to an improved cost position from the conversion from leased to owned chassis and growth from investments in containers. These factors were partially offset by increased purchased transportation and driver related costs, as well as increased FTFM losses in 2018.\nAdjusted income from operations increased $101.9 million, approximately 36%.\nEnterprise operating ratio improved on both a GAAP basis and an adjusted basis. Our operating ratio can be negatively impacted when our lower margin, less asset-focused Logistics segment grows faster than our higher margin, capital-intensive Truckload segment.\nEnterprise Operating Expenses\nKey operating expense items that impacted our income from operations are described below.\n \u2022 Purchased transportation costs increased $360.6 million, or 22%, year over year. The largest drivers of the increase were an increase in brokerage volumes in our Logistics segment, which relies heavily on third-party carriers, and increased third-party prices across all segments. As a percentage of revenues, purchased transportation costs increased 3% period over period. \n \u2022 Salaries, wages, and benefits increased $35.9 million, or 3%, year over year, largely due to increased driver wages offset by lower driver counts caused by the industry wide shortage in driver capacity. Additional reasons for the increase included increased incentive compensation resulting from improved company performance and higher commissions in our brokerage business. As a percentage of revenues, salaries, wages, and benefits decreased 3% period over period. \n \u2022 Fuel and fuel taxes increased $39.3 million, or 13%, year over year, driven by an increase in the cost of fuel per gallon, partially offset by decreased company driver miles in our Truckload segment. A significant portion of changes in fuel costs is recovered through our fuel surcharge programs, however there can be timing differences between when we incur fuel costs and when they are recovered. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization increased $12.3 million, or 4%, year over year, primarily driven by increased trailer and tractor depreciation, as we replaced older units to maintain an appropriate age of fleet. The 2017 conversion from leased to owned chassis in our Intermodal segment also resulted in increased depreciation. \n \u2022 Operating supplies and expenses decreased $2.6 million, or 1%, year over year. The decrease was mainly due to $26.2 million lower rent expense, primarily due to our 2017 conversion from leased to owned chassis, and a reduction in \ntemporary worker pay in our FTFM terminal operations due to the conversion from an agent to company driver model. This was offset by an increase in the amount of sales-type lease equipment sold by our leasing business, resulting in higher cost of goods sold, which is part of the operating supplies and expense line item, an increase in Intermodal rail yard ramp storage costs largely attributed to increased volumes, and a decrease in gains on sales of equipment.\n \u2022 Insurance and related expenses increased $11.9 million, or 13%, year over year, primarily due to increased severity of auto losses and increased volume of cargo losses. \n \u2022 Other general expenses increased $38.5 million, or 36%, year over year. In 2017, other general expenses were lowered by $13.5 million for the reduction of the contingent liability related to the WSL acquisition adjustment, while there was no comparable reduction in 2018. There was also $8.9 million higher driver recruiting and training costs, an increase in professional services fees, including additional costs associated with operating as a public company, and a $5.8 million increase in litigation costs. \nTotal Other Expenses\nOther expenses decreased $5.7 million, approximately 34%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily from a $4.9 million decrease in net interest expense due to lower debt levels and increased interest income, and the recognition of a $3.5 million pre-tax gain related to our ownership interest in Platform Science, Inc. See Note 6, Investments, for more information on Platform Science. These items were partially offset by a $2.4 million increase in net foreign currency losses.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur provision for income taxes increased $222.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 offset by higher taxable income in 2018. Our effective income tax rate was 26.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to (48.0)% for 2017, due to the reduction in the income tax rate and the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Job Act in December 2017. We anticipate that our ongoing effective tax rate will be 25.5% - 26.5% subject to further changes in law.\nSegment Contributions to Income from Operations\nThe following tables summarize revenue and earnings by segment:\n\n\nTruckload\nThe following table presents our key performance metrics for our Truckload segment for the periods indicated, consistent with how revenues and expenses are reported internally for segment purposes:\n\n (1) Revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) in millions. \n (2) Includes company trucks and owner-operator trucks. \n (3) Calculated based on beginning and end of month counts and represents the average number of trucks available to haul freight over the specified time frame. \n (4) Calculated excluding fuel surcharge, consistent with how revenue is reported internally for segment purposes, using weighted workdays. \n (5) Calculated as segment operating expenses divided by segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge). \n * Amounts may not sum due to rounding. \nTruckload revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased $80.6 million, or 4%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to price growth. Effective freight selection and favorable contract pricing resulted in an increase in revenue per truck per week of $221, or 6%, over 2017.\nTruckload income from operations increased $44.3 million, or 23%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to contract price improvements, partially offset by increased driver costs and FTFM losses. The Company is adjusting its FTFM execution model to improve financial performance which centers around reducing variability in the first and middle mile operations, converting more freight to intermodal, for-hire truck and third party capacity, and refining its commercial focus.\nIntermodal\nThe following table presents our key performance indicators for our Intermodal segment for the periods indicated.\n\n (1) Includes company trucks and owner-operator trucks at the end of the period. \n (2) Calculated excluding fuel surcharge, consistent with how revenue is reported internally for segment purposes. \n (3) Calculated as segment operating expenses divided by segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge). \nIntermodal revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased $173.6 million, or 22%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was driven by growth in orders due to the conversion of over-the-road freight to intermodal and an increase in revenue per order of $215, or 11%, over 2017 due to strong price growth and freight mix.\nIntermodal income from operations increased $77.9 million, or 149%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The 2017 conversion to owned chassis, which reduced chassis rental costs, as well as dray execution and network optimization enabled by Quest, all contributed to this increase.\nLogistics\nThe following table presents our key performance indicator for our Logistics segment for the periods indicated.\n\n (1) Calculated as segment operating expenses divided by segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge), consistent with how revenue is reported internally for segment purposes. \nLogistics revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased $190.3 million, or 23%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to growth in our brokerage business. Brokerage volumes increased approximately 17% over 2017 due to favorable market conditions.\nLogistics income from operations increased $13.2 million, or 39%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The growth in revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) cited above was partially offset by increased third-party transportation costs and increased seller and broker commissions due to improved operating results.\nOther\nOur Other segment's loss from operations increased $39.9 million year over year. The $39.9 million increase was driven by the year over year $13.5 million reduction of a contingent liability from the WSL acquisition in 2017 resulting in decreased costs, an increase in incentive compensation due to improved enterprise results, and the $5.8 million settlement of a lawsuit that challenged Washington State labor law compliance. An increase in professional services fees, including additional costs associated with operating as a public company, and Asia goodwill impairment charges of $2.0 million also contributed to the increased loss from operations in our Other segment.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nEnterprise Results Summary\nEnterprise net income increased $233.0 million, approximately 149%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. We recorded a $229.5 million favorable adjustment to our net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the decrease in the federal income tax rate effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. We also recorded\nan $8.1 million after-tax adjustment to a contingent liability related to the WSL acquisition, resulting in a favorable impact on net income.\nAdjusted net income increased $2.7 million, approximately 2%. Higher volumes across all of our segments, productivity improvements, and lower interest expense were partially offset by lower gains on sales of equipment and higher driver and fuel costs.\nComponents of Enterprise Net Income\nEnterprise Revenues\nEnterprise operating revenues increased $337.9 million, approximately 8%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. Significant factors contributing to the increase in revenues were as follows:\n \u2022 A $97.1 million increase in revenues in our Logistics segment, driven by growth in our brokerage business, \n \u2022 An $81.7 million increase in fuel surcharge revenues, excluding Logistics and WSL, \n \u2022 A $68.7 million increase in revenues from WSL, which was acquired on June 1, 2016, \n \u2022 A $42.8 million increase in revenues excluding fuel surcharge, driven by growth in Dedicated Specialty accounts, and \n \u2022 A $22.4 million increase in revenues excluding fuel surcharge in our Intermodal segment, driven by a 7% increase in volumes offset by a 4% decrease in revenue per order. \nEnterprise revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased $245.6 million, approximately 7%.\nEnterprise Income from Operations and Operating Ratio\nEnterprise income from operations decreased $10.1 million, approximately 3%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to duplicate chassis costs of $14.9 million and $8.8 million lower gains on sales of equipment, partially offset by the impact of the $13.5 million adjustment of a WSL contingent liability. See Note 4, Acquisition, and Note 5, Fair Value, for more information on the contingent liability adjustment.\nAdjusted income from operations decreased $11.4 million, approximately 4%. This decrease was primarily driven by the lower gains on sales of equipment mentioned above, as well as increased driver and fuel costs. The majority of our operating costs, with the exception of driver costs and fuel costs, increased in line with the increase in revenues.\nEnterprise operating ratio increased on both a GAAP basis and an adjusted basis. In addition to the decrease in income from operations year over year, our operating ratio was negatively impacted due to changes in our mix of business when our lower margin, less asset-focused Logistics segment grows faster than our higher margin, capital-intensive Truckload segment.\nEnterprise Operating Expenses\nKey operating expense items that impacted our income from operations are described below.\n \u2022 Purchased transportation costs increased $139.3 million, or 10%, year over year. The largest driver of the increase was an increase in volumes in our Logistics segment, which relies heavily on third-party carriers, resulting in $84.8 million higher purchased transportation costs. Truckload and Intermodal segments' purchased transportation costs also increased year over year due to growth in those segments. As a percentage of revenues, purchased transportation costs remained flat. \n \u2022 Salaries, wages, and benefits increased $94.2 million, or 8%, year over year, driven by increased driver and administrative labor costs, and an increase in non-driver associate count. Overall, as a percentage of revenues, total salaries, wages, and benefits remained flat year over year. \n \u2022 Fuel and fuel taxes increased $52.6 million, or 21%, year over year, driven by an increase in the cost of fuel per gallon and a full year of WSL business. A significant portion of changes in fuel costs is recovered through our fuel surcharge programs. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization increased $13.0 million, or 5%, year over year. The main driver of the increase was additional depreciation for capital investments in trailers and owned chassis. \n \u2022 Operating supplies and expenses increased $44.0 million, or 10%, year over year. $27.6 million of the increase was due to an increase in the amount of equipment sold by our leasing business, resulting in higher cost of goods sold, which flows through operating supplies and expenses. There were also $8.8 million lower gains on sales of equipment year over year. \n \u2022 Insurance and related expenses increased $1.2 million year over year. \n \u2022 Other general expenses increased $3.7 million, or 4%, year over year. The primary reasons for the increase were $9.4 million higher driver recruiting and training costs, $4.5 million higher professional fees, and $4.1 million higher bad debt expense, partially offset by the $13.5 million adjustment of a contingent liability related to the WSL acquisition. See Note 4, Acquisition, and Note 5, Fair Value, for more information. As a percentage of revenues, other general expenses remained flat year over year. \nTotal Other Expenses\nOther expenses decreased $7.9 million, approximately 32%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $4.0 million decrease in net interest expense due to lower debt levels, and realized gains from foreign currency exchange rate changes.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur provision for income taxes decreased $235.2 million, or 216% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the favorable impact of lowering our net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the federal income tax rate decrease as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. Our effective income tax rate was (48.0)% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 40.9% for 2016. Our 2017 adjusted effective tax rate, after considering the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was 39.1%.\nSegment Contributions to Income from Operations\nThe following tables summarize revenue and earnings by segment:\n\n\nTruckload\nThe following table presents our key performance metrics for our truckload segment for the periods indicated, consistent with how revenues and expenses are reported internally for segment purposes:\n\n (1) Revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) in millions. \n (2) Includes company trucks and owner-operator trucks. \n (3) Calculated based on beginning and end of month counts and represents the average number of trucks available to haul freight over the specified timeframe. \n (4) Calculated excluding fuel surcharge, consistent with how revenue is reported internally for segment purposes. \n (5) Calculated as segment operating expenses divided by segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge). \n * Amounts may not sum due to rounding. \nTruckload revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased $96.4 million, approximately 5%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to $58.7 million more revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) from WSL (which was acquired in June 2016), as well as growth in Dedicated Specialty accounts, partially offset by decreased freight volumes in our Dedicated Standard and For-hire Standard businesses. Effective freight selection in a strengthening market in the second half of 2017, truck productivity improvements throughout the year, and a favorable year over year price impact resulted in an increase in revenue per truck per week of $131, approximately 4%, over 2016.\nTruckload income from operations decreased $24.9 million, approximately 11%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased driver costs, increased FTFM network buildout costs, the net negative impact of two major hurricanes in the third quarter of 2017, and lower gains on sales of equipment, partially offset by operational efficiencies driven by effective fleet sizing and freight selection.\nIntermodal\nThe following table presents our key performance indicators for our intermodal segment for the periods indicated.\n\n (1) Includes company trucks and owner-operator trucks at the end of the period. \n (2) Calculated excluding fuel surcharge, consistent with how revenue is reported internally for segment purposes. \n (3) Calculated as segment operating expenses divided by segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge). \nIntermodal revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased $22.4 million, approximately 3%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was driven by 7% higher volumes, partially offset by a 4% decrease in revenue per order due to both the competitive pricing environment for most of 2017 and growth in the East, which has a shorter length of haul.\nIntermodal income from operations increased $6.2 million, approximately 13%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared 2016. The increase was driven by higher volumes and tractor and container productivity improvements, partially offset by the increase in duplicate costs due to the 2017 chassis conversion project. Lease costs related to duplicative idle chassis amounted to $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLogistics\nThe following table presents our key performance indicator for our logistics segment for the periods indicated.\n\n (1) Calculated as segment operating expenses divided by segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge), consistent with how revenue is reported internally for segment purposes. \nLogistics revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased $96.9 million, approximately 13%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to growth in our brokerage business. Brokerage volumes increased approximately 12% over 2016.\nLogistics income from operations increased $3.5 million, approximately 11%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The growth in revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) cited above was partially offset by increased third-party transportation costs.\nOther\nOur Other segment's expense from operations decreased $5.1 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, driven primarily by the $13.5 million adjustment of a contingent liability from the WSL acquisition. This decrease was partially offset by higher auto insurance losses year over year and higher professional fees, primarily for transition costs related to public company requirements.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary uses of cash are working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements. Additionally, from time to time, we may use cash for acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. Working capital is required principally to ensure we are able to run the business and have sufficient funds to satisfy maturing short-term debt and operational expenses. Our capital expenditures consist primarily of transportation equipment and information technology.\nHistorically, our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations. In addition, we have a $250.0 million revolving credit facility and a $200.0 million accounts receivable facility. We anticipate that cash generated from operations, together with amounts available under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that these funds will be obtained through additional indebtedness, additional equity offerings, or a combination of these potential sources of funds. Our ability to fund future operating expenses and capital expenditures, as well as our ability to meet future debt service obligations or refinance our indebtedness, will depend on our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, and other factors beyond our control.\nThe following table presents our cash and debt outstanding as of the dates shown.\n\n (1) Debt on our consolidated balance sheets is presented net of deferred financing costs. \nDebt\nAt December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios under our credit agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes. See Note 8, Debt and Credit Facilities, for more information about our short-term and long-term financing arrangements.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes the changes to our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods indicated:\n\nOperating Activities\n2018 Compared to 2017\nCash provided by operating activities increased $105.2 million, approximately 23%, during 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in income before taxes of $101.2 million.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nCash provided by operating activities increased $6.0 million, approximately 1%, during 2017 compared to 2016, driven by the timing of cash payables and other individually insignificant items.\nInvesting Activities\n2018 Compared to 2017\nCash used in investing activities decreased $52.9 million, approximately 14%, during 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease was driven by increased proceeds from the sale of equipment and lease receipts, offset by increased purchases of marketable securities.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nCash used in investing activities decreased $122.8 million, approximately 24%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The main driver of the decrease in cash used was the impact of the June 2016 acquisition of WSL, which resulted in a net cash outflow of $78.2 million in 2016. The remaining decrease in cash used was driven by lower transportation equipment purchases in 2017.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our net capital expenditures.\n\nAnnual transportation equipment purchases have decreased since 2016. Our expenditures were higher in 2016 in order to reduce average tractor age within the fleet, which resulted in lower 2017 and 2018 replacements, and also to take advantage of a strong used tractor and trailer market. In addition, in 2016 we had an initiative to grow trailer count in order to reduce unbilled miles.\nWe currently anticipate net capital expenditures in 2019 to be approximately $340 million.\nFinancing Activities\n2018 Compared to 2017\nCash used in financing activities in 2018 was $88.7 million compared to cash provided by financing activities in 2017 of $36.9 million resulting in a decrease of $125.6 million in cash provided by financing activities. We received approximately $341.0 million of proceeds from our IPO in April 2017 which was partially offset by 2017 one-time payments on the revolver and private placement debt of $235.0 million. In 2018, four quarterly dividend payments at $0.06 per outstanding share were made compared to only three payments at $0.05 per outstanding share in 2017, resulting in a $15.2 million increased use of cash.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nCash provided by financing activities increased $8.8 million, approximately 31%, during 2017 compared to 2016. We received approximately $341.0 million of proceeds from our IPO in April 2017, and we paid $5.8 million less in dividends year over year because our fourth quarter 2017 dividend was paid in January 2018. Significant factors that offset the increase in cash from the IPO were:\n \u2022 A $240.0 million net cash outflow related to our accounts receivable facility. We borrowed a net $105.0 million during 2016 and repaid $135.0 million during 2017 using IPO proceeds. \n \u2022 The repayment of a $100.0 million senior note using IPO proceeds. \n \u2022 A deferred payment of approximately $19.0 million to the former owners of WSL, which included a reduction for a working capital adjustment. \nOther Considerations That Could Affect Our Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources\nDriver Capacity and Wage Cost\nOur professional driver workforce is one of our most valuable assets. Recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers is challenging in an increasingly competitive driver market and has a significant impact on our operating costs and ability to serve our customers. Changes in the demographic composition of the workforce, alternative employment opportunities that become available in the economy, and individual drivers' desire to be home more frequently can affect availability of drivers, including by increasing the wages our drivers require.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no arrangements that meet the definition of off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\n\n(1) Includes unsecured senior notes and equipment financing notes\n(2) Includes firm commitments to purchase transportation equipment\n(3) This amount is shown in the other column because the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated. See Note 10, Income Taxes, for additional information.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that management make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Therefore, these estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities. Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, using historical experience, consultation with third parties, and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. Any effects on our business, financial position, or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nThe estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm.\nClaims Accruals\nReserves are established based on estimated or expected losses for claims. The primary claims arising for the Company consist of accident-related claims for personal injury, collision, and comprehensive compensation, in addition to workers' compensation and cargo liability. We maintain self-insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self-insured liabilities. We also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of the self-insurance amounts.\nThe reserves represent accruals for the estimated self-insured and re-insured portions of pending claims, including adverse development of known claims, as well as incurred but not reported claims. Our estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of the claim, historical trends, advice from third-party administrators and insurers, consultation with actuarial experts, the specific facts of individual cases, the jurisdictions involved, estimates of future claims development, and the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims. The actual cost to settle our self-insured claim liabilities can differ from our reserve estimates because of a number of uncertainties, including the inherent difficulty in estimating the severity of a claim and the potential amount to defend and settle a claim. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had an accrual of approximately $156.0 million and $147.2 million, respectively, for estimated claims net of reinsurance receivables.\nWe have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims. If there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed, or any of the claims would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage, our profitability would be adversely affected. In addition to estimates within our self-insured retention, we also must make judgments concerning our coverage limits. If any claim were to exceed our coverage limits, we would have to accrue for the excess amount. Our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and, if so, by how much. Currently, we are not aware of any such claims. If one or more claims were to exceed our effective coverage limits, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nDepreciation of Property and Equipment\nWe operate a significant number of trucks, trailers,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and related notes.\nINTRODUCTION\nCompany Overview\nWe are a leading transportation and logistics services company providing a broad portfolio of premier truckload, intermodal, and logistics solutions and operating one of the largest for-hire trucking fleets in North America. Our highly flexible and balanced business combines asset-based truckload services with asset-light intermodal and non-asset logistics offerings, enabling us to serve our customers' diverse transportation needs.\nStrategy\nOur goals are to grow revenue and profitability, drive strong and consistent return on capital, and increase stakeholder value resiliently through economic cycles. We believe our competitive strengths position us to pursue our goals by way of the following strategies:\nStrengthen core operations to drive organic growth and maintain a leading market position\nWe intend to drive organic growth through leveraging our existing customer relationships, as well as expanding our customer base. We believe our broad portfolio of services with different asset intensities and our North American footprint, allow for supply chain alternatives which enable new and existing customer growth with the potential to capture a greater share of each customers' annual transportation and logistics spend. We also plan to drive revenue growth by increasing our marketing to customers that seek to outsource their transportation services. Our growth decisions are based on our Value Triangle\u201d, which represents profitable growth while balancing the needs of our customers, our associates, and our shareholders. Our Quest platform serves as an instrumental factor which drives profitability as it enables real-time, data-driven decision support science on every load/order, and assists our associates to proactively manage our services across our network. Together with our highly incentivized and proactive sales organization, our Quest platform will provide better service and organic growth in each of our reportable segments.\nExpand capabilities in the specialty equipment freight market and continue growing our asset-light and non-asset businesses\nWe believe that our specialty freight capabilities position us to grow in the specialty equipment market, which has higher barriers to entry and favors enhanced pricing and lasting customer relationships. The complexity and time-sensitivity of the loads often require increased collaboration with, and greater understanding of, our customers' business needs and processes. The transportation of specialty equipment freight requires specially trained drivers with appropriate licenses and special hauling permits, as well as equipment that can handle items with unique requirements in terms of temperature, freight treatment, size, and shape. As such, there are few carriers that have comparable network scale and capabilities in the specialty equipment market, which we believe will allow us to grow profitably in that business.\nWe have seen strong growth in our Intermodal business and expect it will continue. As an asset-based provider we have more control over our equipment to include containers and chassis, perform most of our own drays, and have strong contractual rail relationships. We believe our Quest platform will enable us to enjoy certain benefits of complete end-to-end control, including increased pick-up and delivery predictability, better visibility, and more capacity when driver capacity is constrained.\nFreight brokerage, which is a significant part of our Logistics segment, is another business where we have seen strong growth, which we expect will continue. As shippers increasingly consolidate their business with fewer freight brokers, we are well-positioned to become one of their select providers due to our customer service, innovative technology, and an established dense network of qualified third-party carriers. Large shippers in particular see the value of working with providers like us that have scale, capacity, and lane density, as they are more reliable, efficient, and cost effective at covering loads. Brokerage serves as a non-asset innovation hub for Schneider, particularly in the areas of predictive analytics, process automation, and new customer relationship generation.\nCapitalize on the growth of e-commerce fulfillment\nAs a first, middle, and final mile\u201d carrier for large parcel consumer items, such as furniture, appliances, electronics, and mattresses, in one of the fastest-growing e-commerce markets, we are positioned to grow. We have the technological capability, national footprint, and the ability to use multiple modes of capacity to provide network breadth and density to meet growing e-commerce fulfillment needs. We provide services for many online retailers, offering first to final mile delivery from warehouses to consumer living rooms. We intend to leverage our end-market expertise, leading technology platform, density, and end-to-end integrated capabilities to continue taking the complexity out of the supply chain for omni-channel retailers, further driving our growth.\nContinue to improve our operations and margins by leveraging benefits from investments in our Quest technology and business transformation\nWe continue to benefit from our Quest technology and business transformation by improving the effectiveness with which we use data to increase revenue and lower costs. Full visibility into each driver's profile allows us to increase driver satisfaction and retention by matching drivers to loads and routes that better fit their individual needs. We can improve our customer service, retain drivers, lower costs, and generate business by anticipating our customers' and drivers' needs and preferences in a dynamic network. We believe the implementation of simple and intuitive customer interfaces will also enable a stronger connection with our customers through increased interaction and an enhanced user experience. We expect additional margin improvement as we continue to leverage data analytics within the Quest platform. Along with our revenue management discipline, the strong foundation we have established with our continuing Quest transformation will allow us to incorporate new technologies and build additional capabilities into the platform over time, maintaining our competitive edge and setting the foundation for future growth.\nAllocate capital across businesses to maximize return on capital, and selectively pursue opportunistic acquisitions\nOur broad portfolio of services provides us with a greater opportunity to allocate capital within our portfolio of services in a manner that maximizes returns across all market cycles and economic conditions. For example, we can efficiently move our equipment between services and regions when we see opportunities to maximize our return on capital. We continually monitor our performance and market conditions to ensure appropriate allocation of capital and resources to grow our businesses, while optimizing returns across reportable segments. Furthermore, our strong balance sheet enables us to carry out an acquisition strategy that strengthens our overall portfolio. We are positioned to leverage our scalable platform and experienced operations team to acquire high-quality businesses that meet our disciplined selection criteria to broaden our service offerings and customer base.\nAttract and retain top talent at all levels to ensure sustainable growth\nOur people are our strongest assets, and we believe they are key to growing our customer base and driving our performance. Our goal is to be the employer of choice; attract, develop, engage, and retain the best talent in the industry. We strive for a high-performance culture with operational excellence and to foster a collaborative environment which seeks individuals who are passionate about our business and fit within our culture. We value the direct relationship we have with our associates, and we intend to continue working together to provide professional growth and a quality work environment without third party representation. Our compensation structure is performance-based and aligns with our strategic objectives. In today's driver constrained environment, we seek to maintain our reputation as a preferred carrier of choice within the driver community and attract and retain high-quality, safe drivers that meet or exceed our qualification standards. We invest in the well-being of our associates through our commitment to ensuring a differentiated driver experience and efforts to improve the quality of drivers' touchpoints. We provide mandatory physical check-ups which cover sleep apnea and urine and hair follicle drug testing, among other things. We believe that investing in the health of our associates helps maintain a high-quality driver base.\nOur leading technology platform facilitates the application, screening, and onboarding of top talent. As an industry leader with a respected safety culture and underlying core values, we believe that we will continue to be the employer of choice for both driving and non-driving associates.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this section of our report we present the following non-GAAP financial measures: (1) revenues (excluding fuel surcharge), (2) adjusted income from operations, (3) adjusted operating ratio, (4) adjusted net income, and (5) adjusted effective tax rate. We also provide reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement believes the use of each of these non-GAAP measures assists investors in understanding our business by (a) removing the impact of items from our operating results that, in our opinion, do not reflect our core operating performance, (b) providing investors with the same information our management uses internally to assess our core operating performance, and (c) presenting comparable financial results between periods. In addition, in the case of revenues (excluding fuel surcharge), we believe the measure is useful to investors because it isolates volume, price, and cost changes directly related to industry demand and the way we operate our business from the external factor of fluctuating fuel prices and the programs we have in place to manage fuel price fluctuations. Fuel-related costs and their impact on our industry are important to our results of operations, but they are often independent of other, more germane factors affecting our results of operations and our industry. Although we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, they have limitations as analytical tools and may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies. You should not consider the non-GAAP measures in this report in isolation or as substitutes for, or alternatives to, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. The exclusion of unusual or infrequent items or other adjustments reflected in the non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will not be affected by unusual or infrequent items or by other items similar to such adjustments. Our management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results in addition to using the non-GAAP measures.\nEnterprise Summary\nThe following table includes key GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for the consolidated enterprise.\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except ratios)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,977.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,383.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,045.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,454.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,997.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,751.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>290.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted income from operations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>383.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>281.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>293.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating ratio (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>268.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net income (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>275.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted effective tax rate (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) We define revenues (excluding fuel surcharge)\u201d as operating revenues less fuel surcharge revenues.

Increased revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) resulted from strong pricing and volume increases in the Logistics and Intermodal segments, which increased $190.3 million and $173.6 million, respectively, driven by an industry-wide shortage in driver capacity and increased customer demand. Other factors contributing to the increase in revenues were as follows:\n \u2022 a $136.5 million increase in fuel surcharge revenues, and \n \u2022 a $80.6 million increase in our Truckload segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge), primarily due to price. \nEnterprise revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased $456.9 million, approximately 11%.\nEnterprise Income from Operations and Operating Ratio\nEnterprise income from operations increased $95.5 million, approximately 34%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in revenue and improved profitability across the segments. The largest contributor to improved profitability was the Intermodal segment, which was due in part to an improved cost position from the conversion from leased to owned chassis and growth from investments in containers. These factors were partially offset by increased purchased transportation and driver related costs, as well as increased FTFM losses in 2018.\nAdjusted income from operations increased $101.9 million, approximately 36%.\nEnterprise operating ratio improved on both a GAAP basis and an adjusted basis. Our operating ratio can be negatively impacted when our lower margin, less asset-focused Logistics segment grows faster than our higher margin, capital-intensive Truckload segment.\nEnterprise Operating Expenses\nKey operating expense items that impacted our income from operations are described below.\n \u2022 Purchased transportation costs increased $360.6 million, or 22%, year over year. The largest drivers of the increase were an increase in brokerage volumes in our Logistics segment, which relies heavily on third-party carriers, and increased third-party prices across all segments. As a percentage of revenues, purchased transportation costs increased 3% period over period. \n \u2022 Salaries, wages, and benefits increased $35.9 million, or 3%, year over year, largely due to increased driver wages offset by lower driver counts caused by the industry wide shortage in driver capacity. Additional reasons for the increase included increased incentive compensation resulting from improved company performance and higher commissions in our brokerage business. As a percentage of revenues, salaries, wages, and benefits decreased 3% period over period. \n \u2022 Fuel and fuel taxes increased $39.3 million, or 13%, year over year, driven by an increase in the cost of fuel per gallon, partially offset by decreased company driver miles in our Truckload segment. A significant portion of changes in fuel costs is recovered through our fuel surcharge programs, however there can be timing differences between when we incur fuel costs and when they are recovered. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization increased $12.3 million, or 4%, year over year, primarily driven by increased trailer and tractor depreciation, as we replaced older units to maintain an appropriate age of fleet. The 2017 conversion from leased to owned chassis in our Intermodal segment also resulted in increased depreciation. \n \u2022 Operating supplies and expenses decreased $2.6 million, or 1%, year over year. The decrease was mainly due to $26.2 million lower rent expense, primarily due to our 2017 conversion from leased to owned chassis, and a reduction in \ntemporary worker pay in our FTFM terminal operations due to the conversion from an agent to company driver model. This was offset by an increase in the amount of sales-type lease equipment sold by our leasing business, resulting in higher cost of goods sold, which is part of the operating supplies and expense line item, an increase in Intermodal rail yard ramp storage costs largely attributed to increased volumes, and a decrease in gains on sales of equipment.\n \u2022 Insurance and related expenses increased $11.9 million, or 13%, year over year, primarily due to increased severity of auto losses and increased volume of cargo losses. \n \u2022 Other general expenses increased $38.5 million, or 36%, year over year. In 2017, other general expenses were lowered by $13.5 million for the reduction of the contingent liability related to the WSL acquisition adjustment, while there was no comparable reduction in 2018. There was also $8.9 million higher driver recruiting and training costs, an increase in professional services fees, including additional costs associated with operating as a public company, and a $5.8 million increase in litigation costs. \nTotal Other Expenses\nOther expenses decreased $5.7 million, approximately 34%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily from a $4.9 million decrease in net interest expense due to lower debt levels and increased interest income, and the recognition of a $3.5 million pre-tax gain related to our ownership interest in Platform Science, Inc. See Note 6, Investments, for more information on Platform Science. These items were partially offset by a $2.4 million increase in net foreign currency losses.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur provision for income taxes increased $222.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 offset by higher taxable income in 2018. Our effective income tax rate was 26.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to (48.0)% for 2017, due to the reduction in the income tax rate and the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Job Act in December 2017. We anticipate that our ongoing effective tax rate will be 25.5% - 26.5% subject to further changes in law.\nSegment Contributions to Income from Operations\nThe following tables summarize revenue and

the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to price growth. Effective freight selection and favorable contract pricing resulted in an increase in revenue per truck per week of $221, or 6%, over 2017.\nTruckload income from operations increased $44.3 million, or 23%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to contract price improvements, partially offset by increased driver costs and FTFM losses. The Company is adjusting its FTFM execution model to improve financial performance which centers around reducing variability in the first and middle mile operations, converting more freight to intermodal, for-hire truck and third party capacity, and refining its commercial focus.\nIntermodal\nThe following table presents our key performance indicators for our Intermodal segment for the periods indicated.\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Orders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>449,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>408,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Containers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trucks (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per order (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating ratio (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes company trucks and owner-operator trucks at the end of the period. \n (2) Calculated excluding fuel surcharge, consistent with how revenue is reported internally for segment purposes. \n (3) Calculated as segment operating expenses divided by segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge). \nIntermodal revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased $173.6 million, or 22%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was driven by growth in orders due to the conversion of over-the-road freight to intermodal and an increase in revenue per order of $215, or 11%, over 2017 due to strong price growth and freight mix.\nIntermodal income from operations increased $77.9 million, or 149%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The 2017 conversion to owned chassis, which reduced chassis rental costs, as well as dray execution and network optimization enabled by Quest, all contributed to this increase.\nLogistics\nThe following table presents our key performance indicator for our Logistics segment for the periods indicated.\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating ratio (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Calculated as segment operating expenses divided by segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge), consistent with how revenue is reported internally for segment purposes. \nLogistics revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased $190.3 million, or 23%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to growth in our brokerage business. Brokerage volumes increased approximately 17% over 2017 due to favorable market conditions.\nLogistics income from operations increased $13.2 million, or 39%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The growth in revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) cited above was partially offset by increased third-party transportation costs and increased seller and broker commissions due to improved operating results.\nOther\nOur Other segment's loss from operations increased $39.9 million year over year. The $39.9 million increase was driven by the year over year $13.5 million reduction of a contingent liability from the WSL acquisition in 2017 resulting in decreased costs, an increase in incentive compensation due to improved enterprise results, and the $5.8 million settlement of a lawsuit that challenged Washington State labor law compliance. An increase in professional services fees, including additional costs associated with operating as a public company, and Asia goodwill impairment charges of $2.0 million also contributed to the increased loss from operations in our Other segment.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nEnterprise Results Summary\nEnterprise net income increased $233.0 million, approximately 149%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. We recorded a $229.5 million favorable adjustment to our net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the decrease in the federal income tax rate effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. We also recorded\nan $8.1 million after-tax adjustment to a contingent liability related to the WSL acquisition, resulting in a favorable impact on net income.\nAdjusted net income increased $2.7 million, approximately 2%. Higher volumes across all of our segments, productivity improvements, and lower interest expense were partially offset by lower gains on sales of equipment and higher driver and fuel costs.\nComponents of Enterprise Net Income\nEnterprise Revenues\nEnterprise operating revenues increased $337.9 million, approximately 8%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. Significant factors contributing to the increase in revenues were as follows:\n \u2022 A $97.1 million increase in revenues in our Logistics segment, driven by growth in our brokerage business, \n \u2022 An $81.7 million increase in fuel surcharge revenues, excluding Logistics and WSL, \n \u2022 A $68.7 million increase in revenues from WSL, which was acquired on June 1, 2016, \n \u2022 A $42.8 million increase in revenues excluding fuel surcharge, driven by growth in Dedicated Specialty accounts, and \n \u2022 A $22.4 million increase in revenues excluding fuel surcharge in our Intermodal segment, driven by a 7% increase in volumes offset by a 4% decrease in revenue per order. \nEnterprise revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased $245.6 million, approximately 7%.\nEnterprise Income from Operations and Operating Ratio\nEnterprise income from operations decreased $10.1 million, approximately 3%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to duplicate chassis costs of $14.9 million and $8.8 million lower gains on sales of equipment, partially offset by the impact of the $13.5 million adjustment of a WSL contingent liability. See Note 4, Acquisition, and Note 5, Fair Value, for more information on the contingent liability adjustment.\nAdjusted income from operations decreased $11.4 million, approximately 4%. This decrease was primarily driven by the lower gains on sales of equipment mentioned above, as well as increased driver and fuel costs. The majority of our operating costs, with the exception of driver costs and fuel costs, increased in line with the increase in revenues.\nEnterprise operating ratio increased on both a GAAP basis and an adjusted basis. In addition to the decrease in income from operations year over year, our operating ratio was negatively impacted due to changes in our mix of business when our lower margin, less asset-focused Logistics segment grows faster than our higher margin, capital-intensive Truckload segment.\nEnterprise Operating Expenses\nKey operating expense items that impacted our income from operations are described below.\n \u2022 Purchased transportation costs increased $139.3 million, or 10%, year over year. The largest driver of the increase was an increase in volumes in our Logistics segment, which relies heavily on third-party carriers, resulting in $84.8 million higher purchased transportation costs. Truckload and Intermodal segments' purchased transportation costs also increased year over year due to growth in those segments. As a percentage of revenues, purchased transportation costs remained flat. \n \u2022 Salaries, wages, and benefits increased $94.2 million, or 8%, year over year, driven by increased driver and administrative labor costs, and an increase in non-driver associate count. Overall, as a percentage of revenues, total salaries, wages, and benefits remained flat year over year. \n \u2022 Fuel and fuel taxes increased $52.6 million, or 21%, year over year, driven by an increase in the cost of fuel per gallon and a full year of WSL business. A significant portion of changes in fuel costs is recovered through our fuel surcharge programs. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization increased $13.0 million, or 5%, year over year. The main driver of the increase was additional depreciation for capital investments in trailers and owned chassis. \n \u2022 Operating supplies and expenses increased $44.0 million, or 10%, year over year. $27.6 million of the increase was due to an increase in the amount of equipment sold by our leasing business, resulting in higher cost of goods sold, which flows through operating supplies and expenses. There were also $8.8 million lower gains on sales of equipment year over year. \n \u2022 Insurance and related expenses increased $1.2 million year over year. \n \u2022 Other general expenses increased $3.7 million, or 4%, year over year. The primary reasons for the increase were $9.4 million higher driver recruiting and training costs, $4.5 million higher professional fees, and $4.1 million higher bad debt expense, partially offset by the $13.5 million adjustment of a contingent liability related to the WSL acquisition. See Note 4, Acquisition, and Note 5, Fair Value, for more information. As a percentage of revenues, other general expenses remained flat year over year. \nTotal Other Expenses\nOther expenses decreased $7.9 million, approximately 32%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $4.0 million decrease in net interest expense due to lower debt levels, and realized gains from foreign currency exchange rate changes.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur provision for income taxes decreased $235.2 million, or 216% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the favorable impact of lowering our net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the federal income tax rate decrease as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. Our effective income tax rate was (48.0)% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 40.9% for 2016. Our 2017 adjusted effective tax rate, after considering the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was 39.1%.\nSegment Contributions to Income from Operations\nThe following tables summarize revenue and

Effective freight selection in a strengthening market in the second half of 2017, truck productivity improvements throughout the year, and a favorable year over year price impact resulted in an increase in revenue per truck per week of $131, approximately 4%, over 2016.\nTruckload income from operations decreased $24.9 million, approximately 11%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased driver costs, increased FTFM network buildout costs, the net negative impact of two major hurricanes in the third quarter of 2017, and lower gains on sales of equipment, partially offset by operational efficiencies driven by effective fleet sizing and freight selection.\nIntermodal\nThe following table presents our key performance indicators for our intermodal segment for the periods indicated.\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Orders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>408,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>381,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Containers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trucks (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per order (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating ratio (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes company trucks and owner-operator trucks at the end of the period. \n (2) Calculated excluding fuel surcharge, consistent with how revenue is reported internally for segment purposes. \n (3) Calculated as segment operating expenses divided by segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge). \nIntermodal revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased $22.4 million, approximately 3%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was driven by 7% higher volumes, partially offset by a 4% decrease in revenue per order due to both the competitive pricing environment for most of 2017 and growth in the East, which has a shorter length of haul.\nIntermodal income from operations increased $6.2 million, approximately 13%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared 2016. The increase was driven by higher volumes and tractor and container productivity improvements, partially offset by the increase in duplicate costs due to the 2017 chassis conversion project. Lease costs related to duplicative idle chassis amounted to $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLogistics\nThe following table presents our key performance indicator for our logistics segment for the periods indicated.\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating ratio (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Calculated as segment operating expenses divided by segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge), consistent with how revenue is reported internally for segment purposes. \nLogistics revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased $96.9 million, approximately 13%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to growth in our brokerage business. Brokerage volumes increased approximately 12% over 2016.\nLogistics income from operations increased $3.5 million, approximately 11%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The growth in revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) cited above was partially offset by increased third-party transportation costs.\nOther\nOur Other segment's expense from operations decreased $5.1 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, driven primarily by the $13.5 million adjustment of a contingent liability from the WSL acquisition. This decrease was partially offset by higher auto insurance losses year over year and higher professional fees, primarily for transition costs related to public company requirements.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary uses of cash are working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements. Additionally, from time to time, we may use cash for acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. Working capital is required principally to ensure we are able to run the business and have sufficient funds to satisfy maturing short-term debt and operational expenses. Our capital expenditures consist primarily of transportation equipment and information technology.\nHistorically, our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations. In addition, we have a $250.0 million revolving credit facility and a $200.0 million accounts receivable facility. We anticipate that cash generated from operations, together with amounts available under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that these funds will be obtained through additional indebtedness, additional equity offerings, or a combination of these potential sources of funds. Our ability to fund future operating expenses and capital expenditures, as well as our ability to meet future debt service obligations or refinance our indebtedness, will depend on our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, and other factors beyond our control.\nThe following table presents our cash and debt outstanding as of the dates shown.\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>378.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>430.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment financing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>411.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>440.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Debt on our consolidated balance sheets is presented net of deferred financing costs. \nDebt\nAt December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios under our credit agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in income before taxes of $101.2 million.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nCash provided by operating activities increased $6.0 million, approximately 1%, during 2017 compared to 2016, driven by the timing of cash payables and other individually insignificant items.\nInvesting Activities\n2018 Compared to 2017\nCash used in investing activities decreased $52.9 million, approximately 14%, during 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease was driven by increased proceeds from the sale of equipment and lease receipts, offset by increased purchases of marketable securities.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nCash used in investing activities decreased $122.8 million, approximately 24%, during 2017 compared to 2016. The main driver of the decrease in cash used was the impact of the June 2016 acquisition of WSL, which resulted in a net cash outflow of $78.2 million in 2016. The remaining decrease in cash used was driven by lower transportation equipment purchases in 2017.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our net capital expenditures.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>385.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>388.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>422.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from sale of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>331.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>351.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>407.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnnual transportation equipment purchases have decreased since 2016. Our expenditures were higher in 2016 in order to reduce average tractor age within the fleet, which resulted in lower 2017 and 2018 replacements, and also to take advantage of a strong used tractor and trailer market. In addition, in 2016 we had an initiative to grow trailer count in order to reduce unbilled miles.\nWe currently anticipate net capital expenditures in 2019 to be approximately $340 million.\nFinancing Activities\n2018 Compared to 2017\nCash used in financing activities in 2018 was $88.7 million compared to cash provided by financing activities in 2017 of $36.9 million resulting in a decrease of $125.6 million in cash provided by financing activities. We received approximately $341.0 million of proceeds from our IPO in April 2017 which was partially offset by 2017 one-time payments on the revolver and private placement debt of $235.0 million. In 2018, four quarterly dividend payments at $0.06 per outstanding share were made compared to only three payments at $0.05 per outstanding share in 2017, resulting in a $15.2 million increased use of cash.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nCash provided by financing activities increased $8.8 million, approximately 31%, during 2017 compared to 2016. We received approximately $341.0 million of proceeds from our IPO in April 2017, and we paid $5.8 million less in dividends year over year because our fourth quarter 2017 dividend was paid in January 2018. Significant factors that offset the increase in cash from the IPO were:\n \u2022 A $240.0 million net cash outflow related to our accounts receivable facility. We borrowed a net $105.0 million during 2016 and repaid $135.0 million during 2017 using IPO proceeds. \n \u2022 The repayment of a $100.0 million senior note using IPO proceeds. \n \u2022 A deferred payment of approximately $19.0 million to the former owners of WSL, which included a reduction for a working capital adjustment. \nOther Considerations That Could Affect Our Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources\nDriver Capacity and Wage Cost\nOur professional driver workforce is one of our most valuable assets. Recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers is challenging in an increasingly competitive driver market and has a significant impact on our operating costs and ability to serve our customers. Changes in the demographic composition of the workforce, alternative employment opportunities that become available in the economy, and individual drivers' desire to be home more frequently can affect availability of drivers, including by increasing the wages our drivers require.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no arrangements that meet the definition of off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Amounts Committed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt principal and interest obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>461.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>265.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>265.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WSL guaranteed payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized tax benefits (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>861.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>386.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes unsecured senior notes and equipment financing notes\n(2) Includes firm commitments to purchase transportation equipment\n(3) This amount is shown in the other column because the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated. See Note 10, Income Taxes, for additional information.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that management make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Therefore, these estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities. Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, using historical experience, consultation with third parties, and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. Any effects on our business, financial position, or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nThe estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm.\nClaims Accruals\nReserves are established based on estimated or expected losses for claims. The primary claims arising for the Company consist of accident-related claims for personal injury, collision, and comprehensive compensation, in addition to workers' compensation and cargo liability. We maintain self-insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self-insured liabilities. We also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of the self-insurance amounts.\nThe reserves represent accruals for the estimated self-insured and re-insured portions of pending claims, including adverse development of known claims, as well as incurred but not reported claims. Our estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of the claim, historical trends, advice from third-party administrators and insurers, consultation with actuarial experts, the specific facts of individual cases, the jurisdictions involved, estimates of future claims development, and the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims. The actual cost to settle our self-insured claim liabilities can differ from our reserve estimates because of a number of uncertainties, including the inherent difficulty in estimating the severity of a claim and the potential amount to defend and settle a claim. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had an accrual of approximately $156.0 million and $147.2 million, respectively, for estimated claims net of reinsurance receivables.\nWe have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims. If there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed, or any of the claims would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage, our profitability would be adversely affected. In addition to estimates within our self-insured retention, we also must make judgments concerning our coverage limits. If any claim were to exceed our coverage limits, we would have to accrue for the excess amount. Our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and, if so, by how much. Currently, we are not aware of any such claims. If one or more claims were to exceed our effective coverage limits, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nDepreciation of Property and Equipment\nWe operate a significant number of trucks, trailers,"}
