Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n2017 Highlights\nAfter a return to consolidated revenue growth in 2016, we expected to continue this growth in 2017 as a result of continued traction across our Software-Systems segment as well as our newly introduced DCEngine product line. Within DCEngine, we expected stable year-on-year revenue from our largest customer and growth resulting from new Tier 1 customer wins. During 2017, our largest customer shifted their deployment strategy mid-year, and coupled with limited traction with new customers, our 2017 consolidated revenue declined $78.6 million, or 37%, year-on-year. Given we had staffed our business to support significant scale in the DCEngine product line the resulting shortfall in revenues drove significant operating losses in 2017. Further, with the material change in our future business outlook we recorded restructuring charges of $8.3 million and inventory charges of $18.0 million which further contributed to our 2017 operating losses.\nIn our Software-Systems segment, revenue declined $9.1 million from 2016 largely due to expected declines from our two largest customers in this segment given timing of their network deployments which drove outsized revenues in 2016. Offsetting these declines were strength across our remaining MobilityEngine and MediaEngine customer bases.\nFollowing is a summary of our consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revenues decreased $78.6 million to $133.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $212.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Hardware Solutions revenue decreased by $69.6 million due to no meaningful hardware revenue from sales of our DCEngine product line to our previous largest customer in the second half of 2017. Software-Systems revenue decreased by $9.1 million due to the timing of commercial deployments by two of our largest customers within the segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue decreased 1,090 basis points to 15.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 26.4% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was the result of $18.0 million in inventory charges from restructuring of the DCEngine product line and last-time buys from certain legacy embedded product customers which also coincided with our decision to change contract manufacturers in Asia. Offsetting the impact of the inventory charges was improved mix towards higher-margin software within our Software-Systems segment as well as lower DCEngine sales contributing to an improved product margin mix within our Hardware Solutions segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>R&D expense decreased $0.7 million to $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

We anticipate these actions will not only significantly lower our cost structure tied to the Hardware Solutions business but also enable us to more meaningfully focus our efforts on growing our high-margin, differentiated Software-Systems business. As the markets for 5G, VoLTE, SDN and NFV continue to grow, we believe our Software-Systems products and services position us to capture increasing levels of revenue growth within this portion of our business. Coupled with our cost-reduction initiatives we expect these actions will position us to begin to scale our business over time in order to return to profitability and generating free cash flow from the business, which is required in order to maintain compliance with our various financial covenants.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of

Revenues in the Software-Systems segment decreased $9.1 million to $47.7 million in 2017 from $56.8 million in 2016. Revenue decline was the result of $9.2 million lower MediaEngine product shipments to a large Asian customer in 2017 due to a significant initial network deployment in 2016 and a $4.2 million decline in FlowEngine revenue offset by a $4.0 million increase in MobilityEngine from 2016.\nRevenues in the Software-Systems segment increased $1.8 million to $56.8 million in 2016 from $55.0 million in 2015. Revenue growth was the result of $2.7 million higher FlowEngine shipments to a tier-one U.S service provider in support of their commercial deployment, offset by a decrease in sales to a large Asian customer deploying our MediaEngine products in support of their greenfield LTE network rollout.\nHardware Solutions. Revenues in the Hardware Solutions segment decreased $69.6 million to $86.0 million in 2017 from $155.6 million in 2016. This is the result of $44.9 million lower hardware revenue from sales of our DCEngine product line to a tier-one U.S. service provider given changes in their deployment strategy as well as expected declines of $22.4 million in non-core legacy hardware products.\nRevenues in the Hardware Solutions segment increased $26.0 million to $155.6 million in 2016 from $129.6 million in 2015. This is the result of growth attributable to $66.9 million in DCEngine sales to a tier-one U.S. service provider in support of their initial data center build outs to deploy value-added services. These increases were offset by expected declines of $40.9 million in non-core legacy hardware products, which is a direct result of the strategic changes implemented early in 2015.\nRevenue by Geography\nThe following tables outline overall revenue dollars (in thousands) and the percentage of revenues, by geographic region:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA\n</td> <td>45,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>28,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>45.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA\n</td> <td>33.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNorth America. North American revenues decreased by $69.6 million to $60.1 million in 2017 from $129.8 million in 2016. This is the result of a material reduction in hardware revenue from sales of our DCEngine product line to a tier-one U.S. service provider year-on-year and coupled with expected declines in our legacy embedded products revenue.\nNorth American revenues increased by $47.2 million to $129.8 million in 2016 from $82.6 million in 2015. This was attributable to increased sales to a tier-one U.S. service provider purchasing both DCEngine and FlowEngine products in support of various commercial deployments as this service provider migrates to next-generation infrastructure.\nEMEA. Revenues from the EMEA region was relatively flat at $45.2 million in 2017 and $45.1 million in 2016. Sales remained consistent with our largest medical imaging customer in Europe as deployments in their end markets remained strong year-on-year.\nRevenues from the EMEA region increased $13.7 million to $45.1 million in 2016 from $31.4 million in 2015. The increase was attributable to new design wins with a top five customer deploying our products in medical imaging and related markets.\nAsia-Pacific. Revenues from the Asia-Pacific region decreased $9.1 million to $28.4 million in 2017 from $37.5 million in 2016. This decrease was tied to lower MediaEngine product shipments to our largest Asian customer.\nRevenues from the Asia-Pacific region decreased $33.1 million to $37.5 million in 2016 from $70.7 million in 2015. This meaningful decrease was tied to declines in sales to legacy Hardware Solutions customers that were impacted by the Company's 2015 shift to focus on key strategic customers who enable us to generate steady levels of profitability and cash flow.\nWe currently expect continued fluctuations in the revenue contribution from each geographic region dependent upon the timing of customer deployments. Additionally, we expect non-U.S. revenues to remain a significant portion of our revenues.\nGross Margin\nThe following table sets forth operating segment gross margins (in thousands):\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Software-Systems\n</td> <td>25,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Hardware Solutions\n</td> <td>3,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(88.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Corporate and other\n</td> <td>(7,864\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,060\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,156\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Software-Systems\n</td> <td>52.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Hardware Solutions\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Corporate and other\n</td> <td>(5.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross margin\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSoftware-Systems. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased 810 basis points to 52.6% in 2017 from 60.7% in 2016.

Gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased 1,500 basis points to 4.1% in 2017 from 19.1% in 2016. This decrease was the result of $18.0 million in net charges from inventory valuation allowance and adverse purchase\ncommitment liabilities and offset by favorable product mix given a lower proportion of DCEngine product sales within the segment.\nGross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased 270 basis points to 19.1% in 2016 from 21.8% in 2015. This decrease is the result of a $66.9 million increase in DCEngine sales to a tier-one U.S. service provider, due to both initial costs of deploying with a Tier 1 service provider as well as proportionally lower overall product margins relative to our legacy embedded products included within this segment. Additionally, net charges from inventory valuation allowance and adverse purchase commitments increased $0.9 million which further contributed to the decline in gross margin.\nCorporate and other.

The increase was attributable to a $0.2 million decrease in the amortization of intangible assets, offset by a $0.1 million increase in stock compensation expense.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our operating expenses (in thousands):\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>32,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible assets amortization\n</td> <td>3,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other charges, net\n</td> <td>8,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development\nR&D expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, product development costs, and related equipment expenses. R&D expenses decreased $0.7 million to $23.4 million in 2017 from $24.1 million in 2016. The expense reductions were the result of reduced headcount due to the Company's restructuring efforts in the fourth quarter of 2017. R&D headcount decreased to 231 at December 31, 2017 from 317 at December 31, 2016.\nR&D expenses decreased $1.5 million to $24.1 million in 2016 from $25.5 million in 2015. The expense reductions were the result of our restructuring efforts within our Hardware Solutions segment personnel reductions in Asia and North America and the concentration of R&D headcount to lower cost geographies and was largely completed by the end of the second quarter 2015. R&D headcount increased to 317 at December 31, 2016 from 310 at December 31, 2015.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nSG&A expenses consist primarily of salary, commissions, bonuses and benefits for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, as well as professional service providers and the costs of other general corporate activities. SG&A expenses decreased $0.9 million to $32.8 million in 2017 from $33.7 million in 2016. The expense reductions were the result of reduced headcount due to the Company's restructuring efforts in the fourth quarter of 2017. SG&A headcount decreased to 127 at December 31, 2017 from 139 at December 31, 2016.\nSG&A expenses increased $3.1 million to $33.7 million in 2016 from $30.6 million in 2015 primarily due to increases in salary, commissions and hiring related expenses of $2.3 million and an increase in marketing related expenses of $0.6 million, as the result of additions to sales and marketing headcount as well as increased product sales. SG&A headcount increased to 139 at December 31, 2016 from 112 at December 31, 2015.\nIntangible Assets Amortization\nIntangible assets amortization decreased $2.0 million to $3.0 million in 2017 from $5.0 million in 2016 due to routine amortization of acquired intangible assets and certain assets reaching the end of their useful lives. Intangible assets amortization in 2016 was comparable to 2015 due to routine amortization of acquired intangible assets. The amortization charges for each year were associated with the amortization of previously acquired intangible assets.\nWe perform impairment reviews of the purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. There have been no impairments of intangible assets recorded to date.\nRestructuring and Other Charges, Net\nRestructuring and other charges, net includes expenses associated with restructuring activities and other gains and losses which are not indicative of our ongoing business operations. Specifically, this may include costs incurred for employee severance, acquisition or divestiture activities, excess facility costs, certain legal costs, asset related charges and other expenses associated with business integration or restructuring activities. We evaluate the adequacy of the accrued restructuring charges on a quarterly basis. As a result, we record reversals to the accrued restructuring in the period in which we determine that expected restructuring and other obligations are less than the amounts accrued.\nRestructuring and other charges, net increased $5.4 million to $8.3 million in 2017 from $2.9 million in 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, restructuring and other charges include the following:\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$5.5 million net expense relating to the severance for 92 employees primarily in connection with a restructuring of the Company's DCEngine product line, reducing the Company's hardware engineering presence in Shenzhen, China as well as reductions in North America due to the transition of the Company's supply chain operations to third party integration partners; an additional $0.8 million of expense will be recognized in 2018 over the notified employees' respective service terms;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$1.7 million fixed asset write offs related to DCEngine restructuring plans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$1.0 million legal and other expense principally associated with contract termination costs and legal costs resulting from the Company's credit facility; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$0.1 million lease abandonment expense associated with reductions in certain of our international sites.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestructuring and other charges, net decreased $2.1 million to $2.9 million in 2016 from $5.0 million in 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, restructuring and other charges include the following:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$2.8 million net expense relating to the severance for 74 employees primarily in connection with a reduction to our hardware engineering presence in Shenzhen, China as well as reductions in North America due to the transition of our supply chain operations to third party integration partners; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$0.1 million integration-related net expense principally associated with asset disposals and transfer-related costs resulting from resource and site consolidation actions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock-based Compensation Expense\nIncluded within costs of sales, R&D and SG&A are expenses associated with stock-based compensation.

Income (loss) from operations decreased by $28.4 million in 2017 to a loss of $18.6 million and was the result of the decline in DCEngine revenues coupled with the significant inventory charges recorded during 2017.\nIncome from operations increased by $0.1 million in 2016. The year over year income from operations was the result of $29.7 million and $28.3 million of previously described gross margin provided by this segment in 2016 and 2015. The $1.3 million increase to gross margin in 2016 was offset by increased sales and marketing expenses tied specifically to accelerating our DCEngine strategy.\nCorporate and other. Corporate and other loss from operations include amortization of intangible assets, stock compensation, restructuring and other expenses. Loss from operations increased by $1.8 million to $21.2 million in 2017 from $19.5 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $5.4 million in restructuring and other expenses offset by $2.0 million decrease in intangible amortization and $1.6 million decrease in stock based compensation expense.\nLoss from operations improved by $2.4 million to $19.5 million in 2016 from $21.9 million in 2015.

Our revolving line of credit had a balance ranging from $3.0 million to $45.0 million throughout the year. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 2016 is the result of higher interest rates under the credit line and carrying a higher average outstanding balance.\nIn 2016, interest expense includes interest incurred on our revolving line of credit. Our revolving line of credit had a balance ranging from $6.0 million to $25.0 million throughout the year. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2015 is the result of the repayment of the 2015 Convertible Notes on February 17, 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income, net decreased $3.0 million to an expense of $1.1 million in 2017 from income of $2.1 million in 2016. We recognized a $0.3 million loss on the realization of cumulative translation adjustments in the third quarter of 2017 associated with liquidation of a foreign entity as the result of previously announced restructuring actions. Additionally, the decrease is due to the decline of the US Dollar relative to the Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupee.\nOther income, net increased $0.6 million to $2.1 million in 2016 from $1.5 million in 2015. We recognized a $0.4 million gain on the realization of cumulative translation adjustments in the second quarter of 2016 associated with liquidation of three foreign entities as the result of previously announced restructuring actions. Additionally, changes are primarily due to cash flow hedge exchange rates between the Indian Rupee and the US Dollar and other currency movements, primarily the Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupee, against the US Dollar.\nIncome Tax Provision\nWe recorded income tax expense of $3.7 million, $2.4 million, and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Our current effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate in all periods due to a full valuation allowance provided against our U.S. net deferred tax assets, Indian dividend distribution tax and a partial valuation allowance against certain of our foreign deferred tax assets.\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had net deferred tax assets of $0.8 million and $1.1 million. We had valuation allowances of $77.4 million and $88.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, which represents a full valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets and a partial valuation allowance against certain of our foreign deferred tax assets. In evaluating our valuation allowance, we considered all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our foreign net deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance, resulting in a charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize all or a portion of the U.S. or foreign net deferred tax assets, we would reverse the previously provided valuation allowance. All future reversals of the valuation allowance would result in a benefit in the period recognized. Although realization is not assured, management believes that it is more likely than not that the balance of the deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance, as of December 31, 2017 will be realized.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign countries, and on occasion, we have been subject to corporate income tax audits. In determining the amount of income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, we have evaluated whether certain tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained by taxing authorities. We believe that we have adequately provided in our financial statements for additional taxes that may result from examination. To the extent the ultimate outcome of an examination differs from the amounts provided for as uncertain tax positions either additional expense or benefit will be recognized in the period in which the examination is effectively settled.\nWe are currently under tax examination in India and Canada. The periods under examination in India are the Company's financial years 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2011. The examinations are in various stages of appellate proceedings and all material uncertain tax positions associated with the examination have been taken into account in the ending balance of the unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017. The periods under examination in Canada are fiscal years 2013 and 2014. We reduced our Canadian tax attribute carryforwards and valuation allowance by $1.5 million as a settlement position related to a proposed adjustment by the Canada Revenue Agency.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act\u201d) was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact the company, most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act also provides for a one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings and the acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27, 2017 as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018, including repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction, acceleration of tax revenue recognition, capitalization of research and development expenditures, additional limitations on executive compensation and limitations on the deductibility of interest.\nWe recognized the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act in our 2017 financial statements in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provides SEC staff guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, in the reporting period in which the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law.

During 2017, our gross borrowings were $93.0 million and we repaid $102.0 million of the borrowings within the period. We expect to continue to borrow additional funds against our line of credit to meet short term intra-quarter needs on an ongoing basis; however, we expect to repay any such borrowings within the quarter as we navigate the timing of customer payments and payables to our suppliers.\nCash generated in financing activities in 2016 of $7.5 million is primarily due to a $10.0 million net draw on our Silicon Valley Bank line of credit and proceeds from the issuance of common stock. During 2016, our gross borrowings were $98.0 million and we repaid $88.0 million of the borrowings within the period. We expect to continue to borrow additional funds against our line of credit to meet short term intra-quarter needs on an ongoing basis; however, we expect to repay any such borrowings within the quarter as we navigate the timing of customer payments and payables to our suppliers. The draw on the line of credit was offset by the payment of payroll taxes associated with restricted stock award releases in the third quarter 2016.\nLine of Credit\nSilicon Valley Bank Credit Agreement\nOur primary source of liquidity, aside from our current working capital, was our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had an outstanding balance of $16.0 million and $25.0 million.\nOn January 3, 2018, concurrently with the Company's entry into the Note Purchase Agreement and the ABL Credit Agreement described below, the Company repaid in full and terminated the Credit Agreement, dated September 19, 2016, between the Company, as borrower, Silicon Valley Bank, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto, which provided for a three-year revolving credit facility with a $30.0 million revolving loan commitment.\nABL Credit Agreement\nOn January 3, 2018, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the ABL Credit Agreement\u201d) between Marquette Business Credit, LLC, as lender (the Lender\u201d), and the Company, as borrower. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility that provides financing of up to $20.0 million, with a $1.5 million sub-limit for letters of credit (the ABL Facility\u201d). Borrowings under the ABL Facility are subject to a borrowing base, which is a formula based upon certain eligible domestic accounts receivables, plus the lesser of (x) certain eligible foreign accounts receivables and (y) $20.0 million and minus certain established reserves and the amount of certain other funds held in blocked accounts. The ABL Credit Agreement matures on January 3, 2021.\nOutstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the applicable base rate, which is the higher of (i) the prime rate then in effect and (ii) LIBOR plus 2.00%, plus, in each case, 1.00% and is payable monthly in arrears. During the continuance of a default or event of default, borrowings under the ABL Facility will bear interest at a rate 2.00% above the otherwise applicable interest rate. Under the ABL Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.375% per annum based on the average unused portion of the revolving loan commitment and certain other fees in connection with the origination of the ABL Facility and the issuance of letters of credit. In connection with the early termination of the ABL Facility, the Company will also be required to pay (x) a fee equal to 2.00% of the total revolving loan commitment if termination occurs on or prior to January 3, 2019 and (y) 1.00% of the total revolving loan commitment if termination occurs after January 3, 2019 and on or prior to January 3, 2020. There is no early termination fee if the ABL Facility is terminated after January 3, 2020.\nThe ABL Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, covenants, indemnities and conditions, in each case, that the Company believes are customary for transactions of this type. Pursuant to the terms of the ABL Credit Agreement, the Company is required to meet certain financial and other restrictive covenants, including maintaining a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) and not exceeding maximum capital expenditures in any fiscal year (each as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement), not exceeding certain thresholds for Cash Loss After Debt Service (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) and. Additionally, the Company is also prohibited from taking certain actions without consent of the Lender, including, without limitation, incurring additional indebtedness, entering into certain mergers or other business combination transactions, disposing of or permitting liens or other encumbrances on the Company's assets and making restricted payments, including cash dividends on shares of the Company's common stock, in each case, except as expressly permitted under the ABL Credit Agreement. The ABL Credit Agreement contains events of default that the Company believes are customary for transactions of this type. If a default occurs and is not cured within the applicable cure period or is not waived, any outstanding obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement may be accelerated.\nThe ABL Facility is guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors (as defined below). The Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the ABL Facility and any guarantee of the ABL Facility (and certain related obligations) are secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral. The Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the ABL Facility and any guarantee of the ABL Facility (and certain related obligations) have first-priority in the waterfall set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement in respect of the liens on the Collateral constituting, among other things, accounts, inventory and cash of the Borrower and the Guarantors (collectively, the ABL Priority Collateral\u201d). The Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the ABL Facility and any guarantee of the ABL facility (and certain related obligations) have second-priority in the waterfall set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement in respect of the liens on the Term Priority Collateral (as defined below). As described below, the Company must also maintaining minimum cash balances in a restricted deposit account of $4.0 million through June 30, 2018 and $6.0 million on and after July 1, 2018, which will secure both the obligations under the Notes and the ABL Facility.\nThe Company paid approximately $2.0 million in debt issuance fees which will be capitalized and expensed over the term of the Note Purchase Agreement.\nHale Capital Note Purchase Agreement\nOn January 3, 2018, the Company also entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) among the Company, as borrower, the Guarantors (as defined below) from time to time party thereto, the purchasers from time to time party thereto (collectively, the Purchasers\u201d) and HCP-FVG, LLC, an affiliate of Hale Capital Partners LP, as collateral agent and as a Purchaser (\"Hale Capital\"). Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers senior secured promissory notes in an aggregate original principal amount of $17.0 million (the \"Notes\").\nThe Notes bear interest at a rate equal to the greater of 4.50% or the prime rate plus 5.75% (currently 10.25% per year), payable monthly in arrears. For any interest payment date occurring on or prior to August 31, 2018, the monthly interest payment will be paid in the form of additional Notes (unless an event of default has occurred and is continuing, in which case all interest shall be paid in cash). Thereafter, the interest will be payable monthly in cash in arrears. Interest on the Notes will\nbe computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprising twelve 30-day months. During the continuance of a default or event of default, the Notes will bear interest at a rate 5.00% above the otherwise applicable interest rate.\nThe maturity date of the Notes is January 3, 2021 (the Term Maturity Date\u201d). The Company is required to redeem the Notes in principal installments of (i) $1.5 million payable on August 31, 2018, (ii) $1.75 million payable on the last day of the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2018, (iii) $1.25 million payable on the last day of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2018 and (iv) $1.5 million payable on the last day of each fiscal quarter beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019 and continuing through the last full fiscal quarter prior to the Term Maturity Date. In addition, the Company will be required to redeem all of the Notes upon a change of control and will be required to make certain mandatory redemptions of the Notes with (x) the net proceeds of any voluntary or involuntary sale or disposition of assets (including casualty losses and condemnation awards, subject to certain exceptions) and (y) 33% of the net proceeds from the issuance or sale of any equity (unless an event of default exists under the Note Purchase Agreement, in which case it will be 100% of the net proceeds), subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The Company may also redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time.\nAll redemptions of the Notes (whether mandatory, optional or as result of the acceleration of the Notes) are subject to a prepayment fee as follows: (i) if a prepayment is on or before January 3, 2020, 5% of the principal prepaid; and (ii) if prepayment is on or after January 4, 2020 and on or before January 2, 2021, 3% of the principal prepaid.\nThe Note Purchase Agreement contains representations and warranties, covenants, indemnities and conditions, in each case, that the Company believes are customary for transactions of this type. Under the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company is required to meet certain financial and other restrictive covenants, including maintaining a minimum Coverage Ratio and Total Liquidity (each as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement), maintaining the amount of negative cumulative cash flow from operations below an agreed threshold, maintaining certain minimum levels of revenue and not exceeding a maximum long-term deferred revenue threshold. Additionally, the Company and its subsidiaries are also prohibited from taking certain actions without consent of the Purchasers, including, without limitation, incurring additional indebtedness, entering into certain mergers or other business combination transactions, disposing of or permitting liens or other encumbrances on their assets, making restricted payments, including cash dividends on shares of the Company's common stock, and other investments and making capital expenditures in excess of certain thresholds, in each case, except as otherwise expressly permitted under the Note Purchase Agreement. The Note Purchase Agreement contains events of default that the Company believes are customary for transactions of this type. If a default occurs and is not cured within the applicable cure period or is not waived, any outstanding obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement may be accelerated.\nThe Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company's U.S. subsidiary, Radisys International LLC ( Radisys International\u201d). Each of its future material domestic subsidiaries will also be required to guarantee the Notes on a senior secured basis (collectively with Radisys International, the Guarantors\u201d). The Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the Notes and any guarantee of the Notes (and certain related obligations) are secured by substantially all of the Company's and the Guarantors' tangible and intangible assets, subject to specified exceptions (the Collateral\u201d). The Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the Notes and any guarantee of the Notes (and certain related obligations) have first-priority in the waterfall set forth in an intercreditor agreement entered into in connection with the Notes and the ABL Facility (the Intercreditor Agreement\u201d) in respect of the liens on the Collateral other than the ABL Priority Collateral (the Term Priority Collateral\u201d). The Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the Notes and any guarantee of the Notes (and certain related obligations) have second-priority in the waterfall set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement in respect of the liens on the ABL Priority Collateral. The Company must also maintain at least $4.0 million in cash in a restricted deposit account at UMB Bank, n.a. or at a restricted deposit account designated by Hale Capital through June 30, 2018 and at least $6.0 million in cash in a restricted deposit account at UMB Bank, n.a. or at a restricted deposit account designated by Hale Capital on and after July 1, 2018. The amount in the restricted account will secure both the obligations under the Notes and the ABL Facility.\n2015 Convertible Senior Notes\nOn February 17, 2015, we repaid at maturity the entire $18.0 million outstanding balance of the 4.50% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the \"2015 convertible senior notes\") in accordance with the terms thereof. No convertible senior notes were converted to common stock.\nDerivatives\nWe enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts for the Indian Rupee to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange risks where natural hedging strategies could not be effectively employed.\nWe do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The purpose of our hedging activities is to reduce the risk that the eventual cash flows of the underlying assets, liabilities and firm commitments will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. In general, our hedging activities do not create foreign currency exchange rate risk because fluctuations in the value of the instruments used for hedging purposes are offset by fluctuations in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged. Counterparties to derivative financial instruments expose us to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance. We do not believe there is a significant credit risk associated with our hedging activities because the counterparties are all large financial institutions with high credit ratings.\nAll derivatives, including foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Unrealized gain positions are recorded as other current assets and unrealized loss positions are recorded as other current liabilities. Changes in the fair values of the outstanding derivatives that are highly effective are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) until net income (loss) is affected by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged transaction. Hedge ineffectiveness may result when the amount of our hedge contracts exceed our forecasted or actual transactions for which the hedge contracts were designed to hedge. Once a hedge contract matures the associated gain (loss) on the contract will remain in other comprehensive income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income (loss), at which time the gain (loss) will be recorded to the expense line item being hedged, which is primarily Cost of Sales, R&D and SG&A. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward foreign currency exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their nature, estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. If anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels, or when the timing of transactions change significantly, we would reclassify a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income (loss) to other income (expense) during the quarter in which the changes occur.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 and the effect of such on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in thousands):\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019-2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021-2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023 & Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (A)\n</td> <td>3,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of credit (B)\n</td> <td>16,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>Purchase obligations include agreements or purchase orders to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.

We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not engage in any activity involving special purpose entities or off-balance sheet financing.\nShelf Registration Statement\nOn August 3, 2016, we filed an unallocated shelf registration statement on Form S-3 for the offering from time to time of up to $100.0 million in securities consisting of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, debt securities or units consisting of one or more of these securities. The SEC declared the shelf registration statement effective on August 12, 2016, and it will expire in August 2019. Except as may be stated in a prospectus supplement for any particular offering, we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities for general corporate purposes, which may include acquiring companies in our industry and related businesses, repaying existing debt, providing additional working capital and procuring capital assets.\nLiquidity Outlook\nOver the past several quarters, we have experienced significant operating losses and more recently consumed significant cash from operations resulting from a material decline in its DCEngine product line. Given the uncertainty of future business from the DCEngine product line, we began taking action in the fourth quarter of 2017 to significantly reduce our overhead and operating expenses moving forward aimed at enabling us to return to profitability and free cash flow generation. These actions also included closing the new financing arrangements subsequent to December 31, 2017, which positioned us to implement the expense reduction actions as well as committed inventory purchases through the first half of 2018.\nA return to profitability and free cash flow generation is based on certain assumptions and projections, including growth from our Software-Systems business. If we are unable to attain certain levels of revenue growth, or meet our cost reduction targets, we may be out of compliance with covenants associated with the new financing arrangements which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nAt December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents amounted to $8.1 million. We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, the proceeds from the sale of the Notes, cash expected to be generated from operations, available borrowings under ABL Credit Agreement and availability, if required, under our $100.0 million unallocated shelf registration statement will satisfy our short and long-term expected working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, and other liquidity requirements associated with our present business operations. If we are unable to comply with various covenants under the ABL Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement due to the timing of orders and shipments from our Software-Systems customers, delays in payment of accounts receivable or other adverse business conditions that impact our operating plans, without an amendment or waiver, our liquidity outlook could be materially and adversely affected. We continue to pursue a number of actions to improve our cash position including (i) minimizing capital expenditures, (ii) effectively managing working capital, (iii) seeking amendments or waivers from lenders and (iv) improving cash flows from operations. These efforts continue in earnest and we are considering all available strategic alternatives and financing possibilities, including, without limitation, the issuance of additional equity, the incurrence of additional secured indebtedness and the exchange or refinancing of existing obligations. In addition, we have from time to time received inquiries and initiated discussions regarding potential strategic alternatives, including inquiries and discussions regarding a possible sale of the Company. We will likely continue to receive inquiries and initiate discussions regarding potential strategic alternatives in the future. We currently have no agreements or commitments to engage in any specific strategic transactions, but we may enter into such a transaction at any time.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nMultiple Element Arrangements\nA significant portion of our revenue relates to product sales for which revenue is recognized upon shipment, with limited judgment required related to product returns. Typically, title transfer for product sales occurs upon delivery of products to our customer's freight forwarders but in certain instances is upon delivery to customer. The software elements included in certain components of Hardware Solutions systems, FlowEngine and MediaEngine products are considered to be functioning together with the non-software elements to provide the tangible product's essential functionality and these arrangements generally include multiple elements such as hardware, professional services, technical support services as well as software upgrades or enhancements on a when and if available basis. Arrangements including multiple elements require significant management judgment to evaluate the effective terms of agreements, our performance commitments and determination of fair value of the various deliverables under the arrangement.\nFor hardware sales which may include software, ASC 605 Revenue Recognition provides a fair value hierarchy in order to determine the appropriate relative fair value for each element of an arrangement. When available, we use vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) to determine the estimated fair value of each element of the arrangement. In the absence of VSOE or third\u2212party evidence (\"TPE\") for a delivered element, we then use an estimated selling price in order to determine fair value. Estimated selling prices represent our best estimate of the price at which it would transact if the deliverables were sold on a standalone basis. For technical support services, we generally determines its selling price based on VSOE as supported by substantive renewal rates in the related service agreements. In certain instances where VSOE cannot be established, we then rely upon its estimated selling price for such deliverables as TPE is generally not available due to the unique company-specific terms surrounding such service agreements. In establishing an appropriate estimated selling price for these technical support agreements, we considered entity specific factors such as its historical and projected costs, historical and projected revenues, and profit objectives. We also considered market specific factors when establishing reasonable profit objectives.\nHardware\nRevenue from hardware products is recognized in accordance with ASC 605 Revenue Recognition. Under our standard terms and conditions of sale, we typically transfer title and risk of loss to the customer at the time product is shipped to the customer and in certain instances upon delivery to the customer, and revenue is recognized accordingly, unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations remain. The amount of revenues derived from these distributors as a percentage of total revenues was 4.6%, 4.6% and 15.1% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Revenues associated with distributors are generally recognized upon shipment as we have established a sell-to model with distributors. We accrue the estimated cost of product warranties, based on historical experience at the time we recognize revenue.\nSoftware licenses and royalties\nRevenue from software licenses and royalties is recognized in accordance with ASC 985 Software. We recognize software license revenue at the time of shipment or upon delivery of the software master provided that the revenue recognition criteria have been met and VSOE exists to allocate the total fee to all undelivered elements of the arrangement. We defer revenue on arrangements including specified software upgrades until the specified upgrade has been delivered. Revenue from\ncustomers for prepaid, non-refundable software royalties is recorded when the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Revenue for non-prepaid royalties is recognized at the time we receive reporting from our customers as we have not established an ability to reliably estimate customer royalties prior to time contractually obligated reporting is received.\nTechnical support services\nTechnical support services revenue is recognized as earned on the straight-line basis over the term of the contract. The fair value of our post-contract support has been determined by renewal rates within our support agreements, the actual amounts charged to customers for renewal of their support services are based on an estimated selling price.\nProfessional and other services\nProfessional services revenue is recognized upon completion of certain contractual milestones, customer acceptance, and percentage of completion of the services rendered. Other services revenues include hardware repair services and custom software implementation projects. Hardware repair services revenues are recognized when the services are complete. Software implementation revenues are recognized upon completion of certain contractual milestones and customer acceptance of the services rendered or as services are performed under the percentage-of-completion method based on labor hours when we are reasonably able to estimate the total effort required to complete the contract.\nDeferred revenue and deferred cost of sales\nRevenue and associated amounts received or billed is deferred for the following types of transactions:\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Undelivered elements of an arrangement - Certain arrangements include specified software upgrades and enhancements to an existing product. Revenue for such arrangements is deferred until the future obligation is fulfilled. Additionally, certain hardware shipments that have been delivered are deferred when customer acceptance is uncertain and is recognized upon customer acceptance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Technical support services - We have a number of technical support agreements with our customers for hardware and software maintenance. Generally, these services are billed in advance and recognized over the term of the agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of sales associated with deferred revenue is also deferred. These deferred costs are recognized when the associated revenue is recognized.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe have a relatively small set of multinational customers that typically make up the majority of our accounts receivable balance. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our trade receivables balances are not overstated. We record reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If circumstances related to customers change, our estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted. If one of our large customers or a number of our smaller customers files for bankruptcy or otherwise is unable to pay the amounts due to us, the current allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no significant account balances reserved.\nWe maintain a non-specific bad debt reserve for all customers. This non-specific bad debt reserve is calculated based on our historical pattern of bad debt write offs as a percentage gross accounts receivable for the current rolling eight quarters.\nInventory Valuation\nWe record an inventory valuation allowance for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories as the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Our inventory valuation allowances establish a new cost basis for inventory. Factors influencing the provision include: changes in demand; rapid technological changes; product life cycle and development plans; component cost trends; product pricing; regulatory requirements affecting components; and physical deterioration. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional provisions for inventory reserves may be required. Our estimate for the allowance is based on the assumption that our customers comply with their current contractual obligations. We provide\nlong-life support to our customers and therefore we have material levels of customer specific inventory. If our customers experience a financial hardship or if we experience unplanned cancellations of customer contracts, the current provision for the inventory reserves may be inadequate. Additionally, we may incur additional expenses associated with any non-cancelable purchase obligations to our suppliers if they provide customer-specific components.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets include definite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment. The net balance of our definite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 amounted to $11.6 million and $24.3 million.\nIntangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, primarily consist of acquired patents, completed technology, technology licenses, trade names and customer lists. Intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives with remaining lives of one to four years as of December 31, 2017. Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, primarily consists of office equipment and software, manufacturing equipment, leasehold improvements and other physical assets owned by us. Property and equipment are being depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from one to fifteen years. We assess impairment of intangible assets and property and equipment whenever conditions indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable.\nConditions that would trigger a long-lived asset impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. If we determine that a long-lived asset impairment assessment is required, we must determine the fair value of the asset. Impairments would be recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value exceeds this calculated fair value of the long-lived asset group. As part of the DCEngine restructuring events in 2017, it was determined a triggering event occurred for that asset group. Through a step 1 analysis the Company concluded no impairment was necessary. No triggering event occurred in any other asset group. The Company determined that no triggering events occurred in 2016.\nConsiderable management judgment is required in determining if and when a condition would trigger an impairment assessment of our long-lived assets and once such a determination has been made, considerable management judgment is required to determine the expected future cash flows and the fair market value of the long-lived asset. If and when a condition has triggered an impairment analysis of our long-lived asset group, we may incur substantial impairment losses due to the write-down or the write-off of our long-lived asset group.\nAccrued Restructuring\nBecause we have a history of paying severance benefits, expenses associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized when probable and estimable.\nWe have engaged, and may continue to engage, in restructuring actions, which require us to make significant estimates in several areas including: realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete; expenses for severance and other employee separation costs; the ability and timing to generate sublease income, as well as our ability to terminate lease obligations at the amounts we have estimated; and other exit costs. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted. For a description of our restructuring actions, refer to our discussion of restructuring and other charges, net in the Results of Operations section.\nAccrued Warranty\nWe provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. Our standard product warranty terms generally include repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time, which is generally 12 to 24 months after shipment. The workmanship of our products produced by our contract manufacturer is covered under warranties provided by the contract manufacturer for 12 to 24 months. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. Our estimated warranty obligation is based upon ongoing product failure rates, internal repair costs, contract manufacturing repair charges for repairs not covered by the contract manufacturer's warranty, average cost per repair and current period product shipments. If actual product failure rates, repair rates, service delivery costs, or post-sales support costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. Additionally, we accrue warranty costs for specific customer product repairs that are in excess of our warranty obligation calculation described above. Accrued warranty reserves are included in short-term and long-term other accrued liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax accounting requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not\u201d that all or a portion of the asset will not be realized due to inability to generate sufficient taxable income in the relevant period to utilize the deferred tax asset. Our net deferred tax assets amounted to $0.8 million as of December 31, 2017. We have considered future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. All future reversals of the valuation allowance would result in a benefit in the period recognized.\nWe evaluate liabilities for estimated tax exposures in all of our operational jurisdictions. The calculation of our tax liabilities includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on recognition and measurement criteria that allow financial statement benefits to be recognized only for tax positions that are more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon tax audit, administrative appeals or final court determination. The liabilities are reviewed for their adequacy and appropriateness. Changes to our assumptions could cause a revision of past estimates. Such a change in measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe measure stock-based compensation at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the employee's requisite service period. For performance-based restricted stock unit awards (\"PRSUs\"), the requisite service period is equal to the period of time over which performance objectives underlying the award are expected to be achieved and vested. The number of shares that ultimately vest depends on the achievement of certain performance criteria over the measurement period. For non-market based performance-based restricted stock we reevaluate quarterly the period during which the performance objective will be met and the number of shares expected to vest. The amount of expense recorded each period is based on our estimate of the number of awards that will ultimately vest.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plans using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model incorporates several highly subjective assumptions including expected volatility, expected term and interest rates.\nIn reaching our determination of expected volatility, we use the historic volatility of our shares of common stock. We base the expected term of our stock options on historic experience. The expected term for purchase rights under our employee stock plans is based on the 18 month offering period. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option or share.\nThe calculation includes several assumptions that require management's judgment. The expected term of the option or share is determined based on assumptions about patterns of employee exercises and represents a probability-weighted average time-period from grant until exercise of stock options, subject to information available at time of grant. Determining expected volatility generally begins with calculating historical volatility for a similar long-term period and then considers the ways in which the future is reasonably expected to differ from the past.\nThe grant-date fair value of the PRSUs awarded in 2015 was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation consistent with the fair value principles of Topic 718 since these awards vest based upon market conditions. Expense is recognized over a derived service period determined by the Monte Carlo simulation. If the conditions of PRSUs are met before the derived service period ends, all remaining expense will be recognized in the period the conditions are met.\nThe input factors used in the valuation models are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment. If there is a difference between the assumptions used in determining stock-based compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time, we may change the input factors used in determining stock-based compensation costs. These changes may materially impact the results of operations in the event such changes are made. In addition, if we were to modify any awards, additional charges would be taken. See Note 16 - Employee Benefit Plans of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion on stock-based compensation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02, \"Leases,\" which requires us as the lessee to recognize most leases on the balance sheet thereby resulting in the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for those leases currently classified as operating leases. The accounting for leases where we are the lessor remains largely unchanged. ASU 2016-02 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. While we are currently assessing the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on the consolidated financial statements, we expect the primary impact to the consolidated financial position upon adoption will be the recognition, on a discounted basis, of the our minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases on the consolidated balance sheets resulting in the recording of right of use assets and lease obligations. Our current minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases are disclosed in Note 13.\nIn May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\" that will supersede all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2015-14, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,\" which was issued in August 2015, revised the effective date for this ASU to annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. In accordance with this standard, the Company will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018.\nThe new standard permits adoption either by using (i) a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption or (ii) a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures. We will adopt using the modified retrospective approach.\nWe have completed the assessment phase and documentation of new policies and evaluation of our internal controls framework. We do not expect a significant change in our control environment due to the adoption of the new standard. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 will also result in additional disclosures around nature and timing of our performance obligations, deferred revenue contract liabilities, deferred contract cost assets, as well as significant judgments and practical expedients used by us.\nUpon adoption, we do not expect a material impact to the opening balance sheet as of January 1, 2018 related to the modified retrospective effect. Although the impact of the new standard will greatly increase the amount of required disclosures we expect revenue recognition for the broad portfolio of its hardware and software sales to remain largely unchanged. Aspects of the new standard expected to impact us include a change in the timing of certain usage-based royalties. Historically revenue was not recognized until fixed and determinable; however, the new ASU requires us to estimate using either the probability weighted expected amount or the most likely amount and estimate the transaction price to recognize when or as control is transferred to the customer. Additionally, for certain professional services with no VSOE under ASC 605, certain licenses would be deferred and recognized with the associated software. Under ASC 606, the determination of the performance obligations may result in a change to the recognition pattern. Such contracts represent a small subset of our total portfolio, however, may shift forward the recognition of revenue. As discussed above, the adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on the opening balance sheet as of January 1, 2018.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I'm unable to understand the table you've provided.\n- It seems to be missing some data - could you please provide me with the missing information?\n- In particular, it looks like some cells in the table contain nothing.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n2017 Highlights\nAfter a return to consolidated revenue growth in 2016, we expected to continue this growth in 2017 as a result of continued traction across our Software-Systems segment as well as our newly introduced DCEngine product line. Within DCEngine, we expected stable year-on-year revenue from our largest customer and growth resulting from new Tier 1 customer wins. During 2017, our largest customer shifted their deployment strategy mid-year, and coupled with limited traction with new customers, our 2017 consolidated revenue declined $78.6 million, or 37%, year-on-year. Given we had staffed our business to support significant scale in the DCEngine product line the resulting shortfall in revenues drove significant operating losses in 2017. Further, with the material change in our future business outlook we recorded restructuring charges of $8.3 million and inventory charges of $18.0 million which further contributed to our 2017 operating losses.\nIn our Software-Systems segment, revenue declined $9.1 million from 2016 largely due to expected declines from our two largest customers in this segment given timing of their network deployments which drove outsized revenues in 2016. Offsetting these declines were strength across our remaining MobilityEngine and MediaEngine customer bases.\nFollowing is a summary of our consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016:\n \u2022 Revenues decreased $78.6 million to $133.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $212.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Hardware Solutions revenue decreased by $69.6 million due to no meaningful hardware revenue from sales of our DCEngine product line to our previous largest customer in the second half of 2017. Software-Systems revenue decreased by $9.1 million due to the timing of commercial deployments by two of our largest customers within the segment. \n \u2022 Our gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue decreased 1,090 basis points to 15.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 26.4% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was the result of $18.0 million in inventory charges from restructuring of the DCEngine product line and last-time buys from certain legacy embedded product customers which also coincided with our decision to change contract manufacturers in Asia. Offsetting the impact of the inventory charges was improved mix towards higher-margin software within our Software-Systems segment as well as lower DCEngine sales contributing to an improved product margin mix within our Hardware Solutions segment. \n \u2022 R&D expense decreased $0.7 million to $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This is the result of lower variable and stock-based compensation expenses recognized in 2017 as well as headcount reductions in the second half of 2017 as part of our restructuring efforts. \n \u2022 SG&A expense decreased $0.9 million to $32.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This is the result of lower variable and stock-based compensation expenses recognized in 2017 as well as headcount reductions in the second half of 2017 as part of our restructuring efforts. \n \u2022 Cash and cash equivalents decreased $25.0 million to $8.1 million at December 31, 2017 from $33.1 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease was the result of $11.9 million of cash used in operations, $9.0 million net repayment on our line of credit, and capital expenditures of $4.9 million. \n \u2022 Deferred revenue at December 31, 2017 declined $2.8 million to $5.3 million from $8.1 million at December 31, 2016, which is aligned with a decline in timing of DCEngine maintenance contracts. \n \u2022 Accounts receivable at December 31, 2017 declined $5.6 million to $32.8 million from $38.4 million at December 31, 2016. The decline was the result of timing of collections. \nOutlook\nIn early January 2018 we announced material restructuring plans associated with our Hardware-Solutions business, predominantly tied to the future business outlook for our DCEngine product line. We anticipate these actions will not only significantly lower our cost structure tied to the Hardware Solutions business but also enable us to more meaningfully focus our efforts on growing our high-margin, differentiated Software-Systems business. As the markets for 5G, VoLTE, SDN and NFV continue to grow, we believe our Software-Systems products and services position us to capture increasing levels of revenue growth within this portion of our business. Coupled with our cost-reduction initiatives we expect these actions will position us to begin to scale our business over time in order to return to profitability and generating free cash flow from the business, which is required in order to maintain compliance with our various financial covenants.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of revenues: \nRevenues\nThe following table sets forth operating segment revenues (in thousands):\n\nSoftware-Systems. Revenues in the Software-Systems segment decreased $9.1 million to $47.7 million in 2017 from $56.8 million in 2016. Revenue decline was the result of $9.2 million lower MediaEngine product shipments to a large Asian customer in 2017 due to a significant initial network deployment in 2016 and a $4.2 million decline in FlowEngine revenue offset by a $4.0 million increase in MobilityEngine from 2016.\nRevenues in the Software-Systems segment increased $1.8 million to $56.8 million in 2016 from $55.0 million in 2015. Revenue growth was the result of $2.7 million higher FlowEngine shipments to a tier-one U.S service provider in support of their commercial deployment, offset by a decrease in sales to a large Asian customer deploying our MediaEngine products in support of their greenfield LTE network rollout.\nHardware Solutions. Revenues in the Hardware Solutions segment decreased $69.6 million to $86.0 million in 2017 from $155.6 million in 2016. This is the result of $44.9 million lower hardware revenue from sales of our DCEngine product line to a tier-one U.S. service provider given changes in their deployment strategy as well as expected declines of $22.4 million in non-core legacy hardware products.\nRevenues in the Hardware Solutions segment increased $26.0 million to $155.6 million in 2016 from $129.6 million in 2015. This is the result of growth attributable to $66.9 million in DCEngine sales to a tier-one U.S. service provider in support of their initial data center build outs to deploy value-added services. These increases were offset by expected declines of $40.9 million in non-core legacy hardware products, which is a direct result of the strategic changes implemented early in 2015.\nRevenue by Geography\nThe following tables outline overall revenue dollars (in thousands) and the percentage of revenues, by geographic region:\n\n\nNorth America. North American revenues decreased by $69.6 million to $60.1 million in 2017 from $129.8 million in 2016. This is the result of a material reduction in hardware revenue from sales of our DCEngine product line to a tier-one U.S. service provider year-on-year and coupled with expected declines in our legacy embedded products revenue.\nNorth American revenues increased by $47.2 million to $129.8 million in 2016 from $82.6 million in 2015. This was attributable to increased sales to a tier-one U.S. service provider purchasing both DCEngine and FlowEngine products in support of various commercial deployments as this service provider migrates to next-generation infrastructure.\nEMEA. Revenues from the EMEA region was relatively flat at $45.2 million in 2017 and $45.1 million in 2016. Sales remained consistent with our largest medical imaging customer in Europe as deployments in their end markets remained strong year-on-year.\nRevenues from the EMEA region increased $13.7 million to $45.1 million in 2016 from $31.4 million in 2015. The increase was attributable to new design wins with a top five customer deploying our products in medical imaging and related markets.\nAsia-Pacific. Revenues from the Asia-Pacific region decreased $9.1 million to $28.4 million in 2017 from $37.5 million in 2016. This decrease was tied to lower MediaEngine product shipments to our largest Asian customer.\nRevenues from the Asia-Pacific region decreased $33.1 million to $37.5 million in 2016 from $70.7 million in 2015. This meaningful decrease was tied to declines in sales to legacy Hardware Solutions customers that were impacted by the Company's 2015 shift to focus on key strategic customers who enable us to generate steady levels of profitability and cash flow.\nWe currently expect continued fluctuations in the revenue contribution from each geographic region dependent upon the timing of customer deployments. Additionally, we expect non-U.S. revenues to remain a significant portion of our revenues.\nGross Margin\nThe following table sets forth operating segment gross margins (in thousands):\n\n\nSoftware-Systems. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased 810 basis points to 52.6% in 2017 from 60.7% in 2016. This was the result of less favorable product mix as compared to the prior year coupled with a decline in FlowEngine product sales.\nGross margin as a percentage of revenues increased 250 basis points to 60.7% in 2016 from 58.2% in 2015. This was the result of more favorable product mix of software-rich product sales including a $2.7 million increase in FlowEngine shipments to a tier-one U.S service provider.\nHardware Solutions. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased 1,500 basis points to 4.1% in 2017 from 19.1% in 2016. This decrease was the result of $18.0 million in net charges from inventory valuation allowance and adverse purchase\ncommitment liabilities and offset by favorable product mix given a lower proportion of DCEngine product sales within the segment.\nGross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased 270 basis points to 19.1% in 2016 from 21.8% in 2015. This decrease is the result of a $66.9 million increase in DCEngine sales to a tier-one U.S. service provider, due to both initial costs of deploying with a Tier 1 service provider as well as proportionally lower overall product margins relative to our legacy embedded products included within this segment. Additionally, net charges from inventory valuation allowance and adverse purchase commitments increased $0.9 million which further contributed to the decline in gross margin.\nCorporate and other. Gross margin increased $0.2 million to $(7.9) million in 2017 from $(8.1) million in 2016. Items included in Corporate and other include expenses not allocated to our two operating segments. These costs include amortization of intangible assets, stock compensation and restructuring and other expenses. The increase was attributable to a $0.2 million decrease in stock based compensation expense.\nGross margin increased $0.1 million to $(8.1) million in 2016 from $(8.2) million in 2015. Items included in Corporate and other include expenses not allocated to our two operating segments. These costs include amortization of intangible assets, stock compensation and restructuring and other expenses. The increase was attributable to a $0.2 million decrease in the amortization of intangible assets, offset by a $0.1 million increase in stock compensation expense.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our operating expenses (in thousands):\n\nResearch and Development\nR&D expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, product development costs, and related equipment expenses. R&D expenses decreased $0.7 million to $23.4 million in 2017 from $24.1 million in 2016. The expense reductions were the result of reduced headcount due to the Company's restructuring efforts in the fourth quarter of 2017. R&D headcount decreased to 231 at December 31, 2017 from 317 at December 31, 2016.\nR&D expenses decreased $1.5 million to $24.1 million in 2016 from $25.5 million in 2015. The expense reductions were the result of our restructuring efforts within our Hardware Solutions segment personnel reductions in Asia and North America and the concentration of R&D headcount to lower cost geographies and was largely completed by the end of the second quarter 2015. R&D headcount increased to 317 at December 31, 2016 from 310 at December 31, 2015.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nSG&A expenses consist primarily of salary, commissions, bonuses and benefits for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, as well as professional service providers and the costs of other general corporate activities. SG&A expenses decreased $0.9 million to $32.8 million in 2017 from $33.7 million in 2016. The expense reductions were the result of reduced headcount due to the Company's restructuring efforts in the fourth quarter of 2017. SG&A headcount decreased to 127 at December 31, 2017 from 139 at December 31, 2016.\nSG&A expenses increased $3.1 million to $33.7 million in 2016 from $30.6 million in 2015 primarily due to increases in salary, commissions and hiring related expenses of $2.3 million and an increase in marketing related expenses of $0.6 million, as the result of additions to sales and marketing headcount as well as increased product sales. SG&A headcount increased to 139 at December 31, 2016 from 112 at December 31, 2015.\nIntangible Assets Amortization\nIntangible assets amortization decreased $2.0 million to $3.0 million in 2017 from $5.0 million in 2016 due to routine amortization of acquired intangible assets and certain assets reaching the end of their useful lives. Intangible assets amortization in 2016 was comparable to 2015 due to routine amortization of acquired intangible assets. The amortization charges for each year were associated with the amortization of previously acquired intangible assets.\nWe perform impairment reviews of the purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. There have been no impairments of intangible assets recorded to date.\nRestructuring and Other Charges, Net\nRestructuring and other charges, net includes expenses associated with restructuring activities and other gains and losses which are not indicative of our ongoing business operations. Specifically, this may include costs incurred for employee severance, acquisition or divestiture activities, excess facility costs, certain legal costs, asset related charges and other expenses associated with business integration or restructuring activities. We evaluate the adequacy of the accrued restructuring charges on a quarterly basis. As a result, we record reversals to the accrued restructuring in the period in which we determine that expected restructuring and other obligations are less than the amounts accrued.\nRestructuring and other charges, net increased $5.4 million to $8.3 million in 2017 from $2.9 million in 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, restructuring and other charges include the following:\n \u2022 $5.5 million net expense relating to the severance for 92 employees primarily in connection with a restructuring of the Company's DCEngine product line, reducing the Company's hardware engineering presence in Shenzhen, China as well as reductions in North America due to the transition of the Company's supply chain operations to third party integration partners; an additional $0.8 million of expense will be recognized in 2018 over the notified employees' respective service terms; \n \u2022 $1.7 million fixed asset write offs related to DCEngine restructuring plans; \n \u2022 $1.0 million legal and other expense principally associated with contract termination costs and legal costs resulting from the Company's credit facility; and \n \u2022 $0.1 million lease abandonment expense associated with reductions in certain of our international sites. \nRestructuring and other charges, net decreased $2.1 million to $2.9 million in 2016 from $5.0 million in 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, restructuring and other charges include the following:\n \u2022 $2.8 million net expense relating to the severance for 74 employees primarily in connection with a reduction to our hardware engineering presence in Shenzhen, China as well as reductions in North America due to the transition of our supply chain operations to third party integration partners; and \n \u2022 $0.1 million integration-related net expense principally associated with asset disposals and transfer-related costs resulting from resource and site consolidation actions; \nStock-based Compensation Expense\nIncluded within costs of sales, R&D and SG&A are expenses associated with stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense consists of amortization of stock-based compensation associated with unvested stock options, restricted stock units and the employee stock purchase plan ( ESPP\u201d).\nWe incurred and recognized stock-based compensation expense as follows (in thousands):\n\nStock-based compensation expense decreased $1.6 million in 2017 to $2.2 million in 2017 compared to $3.8 million in 2016 as a result of not achieving specific performance targets related to executive grants in 2017.\nStock-based compensation expense decreased $0.2 million in 2016 to $3.8 million in 2016 compared to $4.0 million in 2015, primarily as a result of 2014 and 2015 performance based awards earned in the second and fourth quarter of 2016, offset by new performance based awards and stock options granted in 2016.\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\nThe following table summarizes our income (loss) from operations (in thousands):\n\nSoftware-Systems. Loss from operations declined by $7.0 million in 2017 and was the result of the previously described decrease in revenues from our largest customers.\nLoss from operations improved by $1.9 million in 2016 and was the result of the previously described increase in revenue and gross margin.\nHardware Solutions. Income (loss) from operations decreased by $28.4 million in 2017 to a loss of $18.6 million and was the result of the decline in DCEngine revenues coupled with the significant inventory charges recorded during 2017.\nIncome from operations increased by $0.1 million in 2016. The year over year income from operations was the result of $29.7 million and $28.3 million of previously described gross margin provided by this segment in 2016 and 2015. The $1.3 million increase to gross margin in 2016 was offset by increased sales and marketing expenses tied specifically to accelerating our DCEngine strategy.\nCorporate and other. Corporate and other loss from operations include amortization of intangible assets, stock compensation, restructuring and other expenses. Loss from operations increased by $1.8 million to $21.2 million in 2017 from $19.5 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $5.4 million in restructuring and other expenses offset by $2.0 million decrease in intangible amortization and $1.6 million decrease in stock based compensation expense.\nLoss from operations improved by $2.4 million to $19.5 million in 2016 from $21.9 million in 2015. The improvement was primarily due to a $2.1 million decrease in restructuring and other expenses.\nNon-Operating Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our non-operating expenses (in thousands):\n\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense includes interest incurred on our revolving line of credit. Our revolving line of credit had a balance ranging from $3.0 million to $45.0 million throughout the year. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 2016 is the result of higher interest rates under the credit line and carrying a higher average outstanding balance.\nIn 2016, interest expense includes interest incurred on our revolving line of credit. Our revolving line of credit had a balance ranging from $6.0 million to $25.0 million throughout the year. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2015 is the result of the repayment of the 2015 Convertible Notes on February 17, 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income, net decreased $3.0 million to an expense of $1.1 million in 2017 from income of $2.1 million in 2016. We recognized a $0.3 million loss on the realization of cumulative translation adjustments in the third quarter of 2017 associated with liquidation of a foreign entity as the result of previously announced restructuring actions. Additionally, the decrease is due to the decline of the US Dollar relative to the Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupee.\nOther income, net increased $0.6 million to $2.1 million in 2016 from $1.5 million in 2015. We recognized a $0.4 million gain on the realization of cumulative translation adjustments in the second quarter of 2016 associated with liquidation of three foreign entities as the result of previously announced restructuring actions. Additionally, changes are primarily due to cash flow hedge exchange rates between the Indian Rupee and the US Dollar and other currency movements, primarily the Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupee, against the US Dollar.\nIncome Tax Provision\nWe recorded income tax expense of $3.7 million, $2.4 million, and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Our current effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate in all periods due to a full valuation allowance provided against our U.S. net deferred tax assets, Indian dividend distribution tax and a partial valuation allowance against certain of our foreign deferred tax assets.\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had net deferred tax assets of $0.8 million and $1.1 million. We had valuation allowances of $77.4 million and $88.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, which represents a full valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets and a partial valuation allowance against certain of our foreign deferred tax assets. In evaluating our valuation allowance, we considered all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our foreign net deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance, resulting in a charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize all or a portion of the U.S. or foreign net deferred tax assets, we would reverse the previously provided valuation allowance. All future reversals of the valuation allowance would result in a benefit in the period recognized. Although realization is not assured, management believes that it is more likely than not that the balance of the deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance, as of December 31, 2017 will be realized.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign countries, and on occasion, we have been subject to corporate income tax audits. In determining the amount of income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, we have evaluated whether certain tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained by taxing authorities. We believe that we have adequately provided in our financial statements for additional taxes that may result from examination. To the extent the ultimate outcome of an examination differs from the amounts provided for as uncertain tax positions either additional expense or benefit will be recognized in the period in which the examination is effectively settled.\nWe are currently under tax examination in India and Canada. The periods under examination in India are the Company's financial years 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2011. The examinations are in various stages of appellate proceedings and all material uncertain tax positions associated with the examination have been taken into account in the ending balance of the unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017. The periods under examination in Canada are fiscal years 2013 and 2014. We reduced our Canadian tax attribute carryforwards and valuation allowance by $1.5 million as a settlement position related to a proposed adjustment by the Canada Revenue Agency.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act\u201d) was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact the company, most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act also provides for a one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings and the acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27, 2017 as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018, including repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction, acceleration of tax revenue recognition, capitalization of research and development expenditures, additional limitations on executive compensation and limitations on the deductibility of interest.\nWe recognized the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act in our 2017 financial statements in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provides SEC staff guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, in the reporting period in which the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. As such, our financial results reflect the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC Topic 740 is complete and provisional amounts for those specific income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC Topic 740 is incomplete but a reasonable estimate could be determined.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes selected financial information (in thousands): \nCash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents decreased by $25.0 million to $8.1 million at December 31, 2017 from $33.1 million at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the amount of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries was $1.4 million and the remaining $6.7 million was held in the U.S. We do not permanently reinvest funds in our foreign entities. We expect to repatriate cash from these foreign entities on an ongoing basis in future periods in a manner that will not result in significant cash tax payments.\nActivities impacting cash and cash equivalents are as follows (in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities\nCash used by operating activities in 2017 was $11.9 million and consisted of a net loss of $52.6 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $39.7 million, which primarily consisted of intangible amortization, fixed asset depreciation, stock-based compensation expense and inventory valuation allowances, and an increase in working capital items of $1.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, principal drivers to changes in our working capital consisted of the following:\n \u2022 Accounts receivables decreased $5.5 million due to the decrease in fourth quarter revenues over 2016; \n \u2022 Accounts payable decreased $2.2 million due to the lower balances with our contract manufacturers resulting from the decline in DCEngine orders; \n \u2022 Deferred revenue decreased $2.8 million due to the recognition of DCEngine maintenance that was deferred at December 31, 2016 and subsequently recognized in 2017; and \n \u2022 Non-cash inventory charges of $18.0 million from restructuring of the DCEngine product line and last-time buys from customers for legacy embedded products and coupled with our decision to change contract manufacturers in Asia. \nCash provided by operating activities in 2016 was $9.8 million and consisted of a net loss of $10.3 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $24.6 million, which primarily consisted of intangible amortization, fixed asset depreciation, stock-based compensation expense and inventory valuation allowances, and an increase in working capital items of $4.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, principal drivers to changes in our working capital consisted of the following:\n \u2022 Accounts receivables and other receivables decreased $22.6 million due to DCEngine related collections from a tier-one U.S. service provider during the year and collection of related inventory sales to our integration partners in fulfilling these orders; \n \u2022 Accounts payable decreased $22.8 million due to the payment of inventory purchases made in the fourth quarter of 2015 in order to fulfill DCEngine orders shipped during 2016; \n \u2022 Deferred revenue decreased $15.0 million due to the recognition of DCEngine shipments that were deferred at December 31, 2015 and subsequently recognized in 2016; \n \u2022 Inventories and deferred cost of sales decreased $4.9 million tied to the significant DCEngine orders deferred at December 31, 2015 and recognized in 2016; and \n \u2022 Other receivables decreased $7.1 million as the result of collections from the sale of inventories to our integration partner and contract manufacturer. \nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities in 2017 and 2016 of $4.9 million was attributable to ongoing capital expenditures principally associated with our DCEngine product line.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities in 2017 of $8.6 million is primarily due to a $9.0 million net repayment on our Silicon Valley Bank line of credit and proceeds from the issuance of common stock. During 2017, our gross borrowings were $93.0 million and we repaid $102.0 million of the borrowings within the period. We expect to continue to borrow additional funds against our line of credit to meet short term intra-quarter needs on an ongoing basis; however, we expect to repay any such borrowings within the quarter as we navigate the timing of customer payments and payables to our suppliers.\nCash generated in financing activities in 2016 of $7.5 million is primarily due to a $10.0 million net draw on our Silicon Valley Bank line of credit and proceeds from the issuance of common stock. During 2016, our gross borrowings were $98.0 million and we repaid $88.0 million of the borrowings within the period. We expect to continue to borrow additional funds against our line of credit to meet short term intra-quarter needs on an ongoing basis; however, we expect to repay any such borrowings within the quarter as we navigate the timing of customer payments and payables to our suppliers. The draw on the line of credit was offset by the payment of payroll taxes associated with restricted stock award releases in the third quarter 2016.\nLine of Credit\nSilicon Valley Bank Credit Agreement\nOur primary source of liquidity, aside from our current working capital, was our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had an outstanding balance of $16.0 million and $25.0 million.\nOn January 3, 2018, concurrently with the Company's entry into the Note Purchase Agreement and the ABL Credit Agreement described below, the Company repaid in full and terminated the Credit Agreement, dated September 19, 2016, between the Company, as borrower, Silicon Valley Bank, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto, which provided for a three-year revolving credit facility with a $30.0 million revolving loan commitment.\nABL Credit Agreement\nOn January 3, 2018, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the ABL Credit Agreement\u201d) between Marquette Business Credit, LLC, as lender (the Lender\u201d), and the Company, as borrower. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility that provides financing of up to $20.0 million, with a $1.5 million sub-limit for letters of credit (the ABL Facility\u201d). Borrowings under the ABL Facility are subject to a borrowing base, which is a formula based upon certain eligible domestic accounts receivables, plus the lesser of (x) certain eligible foreign accounts receivables and (y) $20.0 million and minus certain established reserves and the amount of certain other funds held in blocked accounts. The ABL Credit Agreement matures on January 3, 2021.\nOutstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the applicable base rate, which is the higher of (i) the prime rate then in effect and (ii) LIBOR plus 2.00%, plus, in each case, 1.00% and is payable monthly in arrears. During the continuance of a default or event of default, borrowings under the ABL Facility will bear interest at a rate 2.00% above the otherwise applicable interest rate. Under the ABL Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.375% per annum based on the average unused portion of the revolving loan commitment and certain other fees in connection with the origination of the ABL Facility and the issuance of letters of credit. In connection with the early termination of the ABL Facility, the Company will also be required to pay (x) a fee equal to 2.00% of the total revolving loan commitment if termination occurs on or prior to January 3, 2019 and (y) 1.00% of the total revolving loan commitment if termination occurs after January 3, 2019 and on or prior to January 3, 2020. There is no early termination fee if the ABL Facility is terminated after January 3, 2020.\nThe ABL Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, covenants, indemnities and conditions, in each case, that the Company believes are customary for transactions of this type. Pursuant to the terms of the ABL Credit Agreement, the Company is required to meet certain financial and other restrictive covenants, including maintaining a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) and not exceeding maximum capital expenditures in any fiscal year (each as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement), not exceeding certain thresholds for Cash Loss After Debt Service (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) and. Additionally, the Company is also prohibited from taking certain actions without consent of the Lender, including, without limitation, incurring additional indebtedness, entering into certain mergers or other business combination transactions, disposing of or permitting liens or other encumbrances on the Company's assets and making restricted payments, including cash dividends on shares of the Company's common stock, in each case, except as expressly permitted under the ABL Credit Agreement. The ABL Credit Agreement contains events of default that the Company believes are customary for transactions of this type. If a default occurs and is not cured within the applicable cure period or is not waived, any outstanding obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement may be accelerated.\nThe ABL Facility is guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors (as defined below). The Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the ABL Facility and any guarantee of the ABL Facility (and certain related obligations) are secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral. The Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the ABL Facility and any guarantee of the ABL Facility (and certain related obligations) have first-priority in the waterfall set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement in respect of the liens on the Collateral constituting, among other things, accounts, inventory and cash of the Borrower and the Guarantors (collectively, the ABL Priority Collateral\u201d). The Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the ABL Facility and any guarantee of the ABL facility (and certain related obligations) have second-priority in the waterfall set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement in respect of the liens on the Term Priority Collateral (as defined below). As described below, the Company must also maintaining minimum cash balances in a restricted deposit account of $4.0 million through June 30, 2018 and $6.0 million on and after July 1, 2018, which will secure both the obligations under the Notes and the ABL Facility.\nThe Company paid approximately $2.0 million in debt issuance fees which will be capitalized and expensed over the term of the Note Purchase Agreement.\nHale Capital Note Purchase Agreement\nOn January 3, 2018, the Company also entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) among the Company, as borrower, the Guarantors (as defined below) from time to time party thereto, the purchasers from time to time party thereto (collectively, the Purchasers\u201d) and HCP-FVG, LLC, an affiliate of Hale Capital Partners LP, as collateral agent and as a Purchaser (\"Hale Capital\"). Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers senior secured promissory notes in an aggregate original principal amount of $17.0 million (the \"Notes\").\nThe Notes bear interest at a rate equal to the greater of 4.50% or the prime rate plus 5.75% (currently 10.25% per year), payable monthly in arrears. For any interest payment date occurring on or prior to August 31, 2018, the monthly interest payment will be paid in the form of additional Notes (unless an event of default has occurred and is continuing, in which case all interest shall be paid in cash). Thereafter, the interest will be payable monthly in cash in arrears. Interest on the Notes will\nbe computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprising twelve 30-day months. During the continuance of a default or event of default, the Notes will bear interest at a rate 5.00% above the otherwise applicable interest rate.\nThe maturity date of the Notes is January 3, 2021 (the Term Maturity Date\u201d). The Company is required to redeem the Notes in principal installments of (i) $1.5 million payable on August 31, 2018, (ii) $1.75 million payable on the last day of the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2018, (iii) $1.25 million payable on the last day of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2018 and (iv) $1.5 million payable on the last day of each fiscal quarter beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019 and continuing through the last full fiscal quarter prior to the Term Maturity Date. In addition, the Company will be required to redeem all of the Notes upon a change of control and will be required to make certain mandatory redemptions of the Notes with (x) the net proceeds of any voluntary or involuntary sale or disposition of assets (including casualty losses and condemnation awards, subject to certain exceptions) and (y) 33% of the net proceeds from the issuance or sale of any equity (unless an event of default exists under the Note Purchase Agreement, in which case it will be 100% of the net proceeds), subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The Company may also redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time.\nAll redemptions of the Notes (whether mandatory, optional or as result of the acceleration of the Notes) are subject to a prepayment fee as follows: (i) if a prepayment is on or before January 3, 2020, 5% of the principal prepaid; and (ii) if prepayment is on or after January 4, 2020 and on or before January 2, 2021, 3% of the principal prepaid.\nThe Note Purchase Agreement contains representations and warranties, covenants, indemnities and conditions, in each case, that the Company believes are customary for transactions of this type. Under the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company is required to meet certain financial and other restrictive covenants, including maintaining a minimum Coverage Ratio and Total Liquidity (each as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement), maintaining the amount of negative cumulative cash flow from operations below an agreed threshold, maintaining certain minimum levels of revenue and not exceeding a maximum long-term deferred revenue threshold. Additionally, the Company and its subsidiaries are also prohibited from taking certain actions without consent of the Purchasers, including, without limitation, incurring additional indebtedness, entering into certain mergers or other business combination transactions, disposing of or permitting liens or other encumbrances on their assets, making restricted payments, including cash dividends on shares of the Company's common stock, and other investments and making capital expenditures in excess of certain thresholds, in each case, except as otherwise expressly permitted under the Note Purchase Agreement. The Note Purchase Agreement contains events of default that the Company believes are customary for transactions of this type. If a default occurs and is not cured within the applicable cure period or is not waived, any outstanding obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement may be accelerated.\nThe Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company's U.S. subsidiary, Radisys International LLC ( Radisys International\u201d). Each of its future material domestic subsidiaries will also be required to guarantee the Notes on a senior secured basis (collectively with Radisys International, the Guarantors\u201d). The Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the Notes and any guarantee of the Notes (and certain related obligations) are secured by substantially all of the Company's and the Guarantors' tangible and intangible assets, subject to specified exceptions (the Collateral\u201d). The Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the Notes and any guarantee of the Notes (and certain related obligations) have first-priority in the waterfall set forth in an intercreditor agreement entered into in connection with the Notes and the ABL Facility (the Intercreditor Agreement\u201d) in respect of the liens on the Collateral other than the ABL Priority Collateral (the Term Priority Collateral\u201d). The Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the Notes and any guarantee of the Notes (and certain related obligations) have second-priority in the waterfall set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement in respect of the liens on the ABL Priority Collateral. The Company must also maintain at least $4.0 million in cash in a restricted deposit account at UMB Bank, n.a. or at a restricted deposit account designated by Hale Capital through June 30, 2018 and at least $6.0 million in cash in a restricted deposit account at UMB Bank, n.a. or at a restricted deposit account designated by Hale Capital on and after July 1, 2018. The amount in the restricted account will secure both the obligations under the Notes and the ABL Facility.\n2015 Convertible Senior Notes\nOn February 17, 2015, we repaid at maturity the entire $18.0 million outstanding balance of the 4.50% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the \"2015 convertible senior notes\") in accordance with the terms thereof. No convertible senior notes were converted to common stock.\nDerivatives\nWe enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts for the Indian Rupee to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange risks where natural hedging strategies could not be effectively employed.\nWe do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The purpose of our hedging activities is to reduce the risk that the eventual cash flows of the underlying assets, liabilities and firm commitments will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. In general, our hedging activities do not create foreign currency exchange rate risk because fluctuations in the value of the instruments used for hedging purposes are offset by fluctuations in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged. Counterparties to derivative financial instruments expose us to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance. We do not believe there is a significant credit risk associated with our hedging activities because the counterparties are all large financial institutions with high credit ratings.\nAll derivatives, including foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Unrealized gain positions are recorded as other current assets and unrealized loss positions are recorded as other current liabilities. Changes in the fair values of the outstanding derivatives that are highly effective are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) until net income (loss) is affected by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged transaction. Hedge ineffectiveness may result when the amount of our hedge contracts exceed our forecasted or actual transactions for which the hedge contracts were designed to hedge. Once a hedge contract matures the associated gain (loss) on the contract will remain in other comprehensive income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income (loss), at which time the gain (loss) will be recorded to the expense line item being hedged, which is primarily Cost of Sales, R&D and SG&A. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward foreign currency exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their nature, estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. If anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels, or when the timing of transactions change significantly, we would reclassify a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income (loss) to other income (expense) during the quarter in which the changes occur.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 and the effect of such on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in thousands):\n\n (A) Purchase obligations include agreements or purchase orders to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. These purchase obligations are entered into in the ordinary course of business and are expected to be funded by cash flows from continuing operations. (B) The secured revolving line of credit agreement was replaced on January 3, 2018. See Note 19 - Subsequent Events \nIn addition to the above, we have approximately $4.6 million in liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not engage in any activity involving special purpose entities or off-balance sheet financing.\nShelf Registration Statement\nOn August 3, 2016, we filed an unallocated shelf registration statement on Form S-3 for the offering from time to time of up to $100.0 million in securities consisting of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, debt securities or units consisting of one or more of these securities. The SEC declared the shelf registration statement effective on August 12, 2016, and it will expire in August 2019. Except as may be stated in a prospectus supplement for any particular offering, we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities for general corporate purposes, which may include acquiring companies in our industry and related businesses, repaying existing debt, providing additional working capital and procuring capital assets.\nLiquidity Outlook\nOver the past several quarters, we have experienced significant operating losses and more recently consumed significant cash from operations resulting from a material decline in its DCEngine product line. Given the uncertainty of future business from the DCEngine product line, we began taking action in the fourth quarter of 2017 to significantly reduce our overhead and operating expenses moving forward aimed at enabling us to return to profitability and free cash flow generation. These actions also included closing the new financing arrangements subsequent to December 31, 2017, which positioned us to implement the expense reduction actions as well as committed inventory purchases through the first half of 2018.\nA return to profitability and free cash flow generation is based on certain assumptions and projections, including growth from our Software-Systems business. If we are unable to attain certain levels of revenue growth, or meet our cost reduction targets, we may be out of compliance with covenants associated with the new financing arrangements which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nAt December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents amounted to $8.1 million. We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, the proceeds from the sale of the Notes, cash expected to be generated from operations, available borrowings under ABL Credit Agreement and availability, if required, under our $100.0 million unallocated shelf registration statement will satisfy our short and long-term expected working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, and other liquidity requirements associated with our present business operations. If we are unable to comply with various covenants under the ABL Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement due to the timing of orders and shipments from our Software-Systems customers, delays in payment of accounts receivable or other adverse business conditions that impact our operating plans, without an amendment or waiver, our liquidity outlook could be materially and adversely affected. We continue to pursue a number of actions to improve our cash position including (i) minimizing capital expenditures, (ii) effectively managing working capital, (iii) seeking amendments or waivers from lenders and (iv) improving cash flows from operations. These efforts continue in earnest and we are considering all available strategic alternatives and financing possibilities, including, without limitation, the issuance of additional equity, the incurrence of additional secured indebtedness and the exchange or refinancing of existing obligations. In addition, we have from time to time received inquiries and initiated discussions regarding potential strategic alternatives, including inquiries and discussions regarding a possible sale of the Company. We will likely continue to receive inquiries and initiate discussions regarding potential strategic alternatives in the future. We currently have no agreements or commitments to engage in any specific strategic transactions, but we may enter into such a transaction at any time.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nMultiple Element Arrangements\nA significant portion of our revenue relates to product sales for which revenue is recognized upon shipment, with limited judgment required related to product returns. Typically, title transfer for product sales occurs upon delivery of products to our customer's freight forwarders but in certain instances is upon delivery to customer. The software elements", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n2017 Highlights\nAfter a return to consolidated revenue growth in 2016, we expected to continue this growth in 2017 as a result of continued traction across our Software-Systems segment as well as our newly introduced DCEngine product line. Within DCEngine, we expected stable year-on-year revenue from our largest customer and growth resulting from new Tier 1 customer wins. During 2017, our largest customer shifted their deployment strategy mid-year, and coupled with limited traction with new customers, our 2017 consolidated revenue declined $78.6 million, or 37%, year-on-year. Given we had staffed our business to support significant scale in the DCEngine product line the resulting shortfall in revenues drove significant operating losses in 2017. Further, with the material change in our future business outlook we recorded restructuring charges of $8.3 million and inventory charges of $18.0 million which further contributed to our 2017 operating losses.\nIn our Software-Systems segment, revenue declined $9.1 million from 2016 largely due to expected declines from our two largest customers in this segment given timing of their network deployments which drove outsized revenues in 2016. Offsetting these declines were strength across our remaining MobilityEngine and MediaEngine customer bases.\nFollowing is a summary of our consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016:\n \u2022 Revenues decreased $78.6 million to $133.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $212.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Hardware Solutions revenue decreased by $69.6 million due to no meaningful hardware revenue from sales of our DCEngine product line to our previous largest customer in the second half of 2017. Software-Systems revenue decreased by $9.1 million due to the timing of commercial deployments by two of our largest customers within the segment. \n \u2022 Our gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue decreased 1,090 basis points to 15.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 26.4% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was the result of $18.0 million in inventory charges from restructuring of the DCEngine product line and last-time buys from certain legacy embedded product customers which also coincided with our decision to change contract manufacturers in Asia. Offsetting the impact of the inventory charges was improved mix towards higher-margin software within our Software-Systems segment as well as lower DCEngine sales contributing to an improved product margin mix within our Hardware Solutions segment. \n \u2022 R&D expense decreased $0.7 million to $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This is the result of lower variable and stock-based compensation expenses recognized in 2017 as well as headcount reductions in the second half of 2017 as part of our restructuring efforts. \n \u2022 SG&A expense decreased $0.9 million to $32.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This is the result of lower variable and stock-based compensation expenses recognized in 2017 as well as headcount reductions in the second half of 2017 as part of our restructuring efforts. \n \u2022 Cash and cash equivalents decreased $25.0 million to $8.1 million at December 31, 2017 from $33.1 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease was the result of $11.9 million of cash used in operations, $9.0 million net repayment on our line of credit, and capital expenditures of $4.9 million. \n \u2022 Deferred revenue at December 31, 2017 declined $2.8 million to $5.3 million from $8.1 million at December 31, 2016, which is aligned with a decline in timing of DCEngine maintenance contracts. \n \u2022 Accounts receivable at December 31, 2017 declined $5.6 million to $32.8 million from $38.4 million at December 31, 2016. The decline was the result of timing of collections. \nOutlook\nIn early January 2018 we announced material restructuring plans associated with our Hardware-Solutions business, predominantly tied to the future business outlook for our DCEngine product line. We anticipate these actions will not only significantly lower our cost structure tied to the Hardware Solutions business but also enable us to more meaningfully focus our efforts on growing our high-margin, differentiated Software-Systems business. As the markets for 5G, VoLTE, SDN and NFV continue to grow, we believe our Software-Systems products and services position us to capture increasing levels of revenue growth within this portion of our business. Coupled with our cost-reduction initiatives we expect these actions will position us to begin to scale our business over time in order to return to profitability and generating free cash flow from the business, which is required in order to maintain compliance with our various financial covenants.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of

Revenues in the Software-Systems segment decreased $9.1 million to $47.7 million in 2017 from $56.8 million in 2016. Revenue decline was the result of $9.2 million lower MediaEngine product shipments to a large Asian customer in 2017 due to a significant initial network deployment in 2016 and a $4.2 million decline in FlowEngine revenue offset by a $4.0 million increase in MobilityEngine from 2016.\nRevenues in the Software-Systems segment increased $1.8 million to $56.8 million in 2016 from $55.0 million in 2015. Revenue growth was the result of $2.7 million higher FlowEngine shipments to a tier-one U.S service provider in support of their commercial deployment, offset by a decrease in sales to a large Asian customer deploying our MediaEngine products in support of their greenfield LTE network rollout.\nHardware Solutions. Revenues in the Hardware Solutions segment decreased $69.6 million to $86.0 million in 2017 from $155.6 million in 2016. This is the result of $44.9 million lower hardware revenue from sales of our DCEngine product line to a tier-one U.S. service provider given changes in their deployment strategy as well as expected declines of $22.4 million in non-core legacy hardware products.\nRevenues in the Hardware Solutions segment increased $26.0 million to $155.6 million in 2016 from $129.6 million in 2015. This is the result of growth attributable to $66.9 million in DCEngine sales to a tier-one U.S. service provider in support of their initial data center build outs to deploy value-added services. These increases were offset by expected declines of $40.9 million in non-core legacy hardware products, which is a direct result of the strategic changes implemented early in 2015.\nRevenue by Geography\nThe following tables outline overall revenue dollars (in thousands) and the percentage of revenues, by geographic region:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA\n</td> <td>45,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>28,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>45.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA\n</td> <td>33.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNorth America. North American revenues decreased by $69.6 million to $60.1 million in 2017 from $129.8 million in 2016. This is the result of a material reduction in hardware revenue from sales of our DCEngine product line to a tier-one U.S. service provider year-on-year and coupled with expected declines in our legacy embedded products revenue.\nNorth American revenues increased by $47.2 million to $129.8 million in 2016 from $82.6 million in 2015. This was attributable to increased sales to a tier-one U.S. service provider purchasing both DCEngine and FlowEngine products in support of various commercial deployments as this service provider migrates to next-generation infrastructure.\nEMEA. Revenues from the EMEA region was relatively flat at $45.2 million in 2017 and $45.1 million in 2016. Sales remained consistent with our largest medical imaging customer in Europe as deployments in their end markets remained strong year-on-year.\nRevenues from the EMEA region increased $13.7 million to $45.1 million in 2016 from $31.4 million in 2015. The increase was attributable to new design wins with a top five customer deploying our products in medical imaging and related markets.\nAsia-Pacific. Revenues from the Asia-Pacific region decreased $9.1 million to $28.4 million in 2017 from $37.5 million in 2016. This decrease was tied to lower MediaEngine product shipments to our largest Asian customer.\nRevenues from the Asia-Pacific region decreased $33.1 million to $37.5 million in 2016 from $70.7 million in 2015. This meaningful decrease was tied to declines in sales to legacy Hardware Solutions customers that were impacted by the Company's 2015 shift to focus on key strategic customers who enable us to generate steady levels of profitability and cash flow.\nWe currently expect continued fluctuations in the revenue contribution from each geographic region dependent upon the timing of customer deployments. Additionally, we expect non-U.S. revenues to remain a significant portion of our revenues.\nGross Margin\nThe following table sets forth operating segment gross margins (in thousands):\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Software-Systems\n</td> <td>25,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Hardware Solutions\n</td> <td>3,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(88.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Corporate and other\n</td> <td>(7,864\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,060\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,156\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Software-Systems\n</td> <td>52.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Hardware Solutions\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Corporate and other\n</td> <td>(5.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross margin\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSoftware-Systems. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased 810 basis points to 52.6% in 2017 from 60.7% in 2016.

This was the result of more favorable product mix of software-rich product sales including a $2.7 million increase in FlowEngine shipments to a tier-one U.S service provider.\nHardware Solutions. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased 1,500 basis points to 4.1% in 2017 from 19.1% in 2016. This decrease was the result of $18.0 million in net charges from inventory valuation allowance and adverse purchase\ncommitment liabilities and offset by favorable product mix given a lower proportion of DCEngine product sales within the segment.\nGross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased 270 basis points to 19.1% in 2016 from 21.8% in 2015. This decrease is the result of a $66.9 million increase in DCEngine sales to a tier-one U.S. service provider, due to both initial costs of deploying with a Tier 1 service provider as well as proportionally lower overall product margins relative to our legacy embedded products included within this segment. Additionally, net charges from inventory valuation allowance and adverse purchase commitments increased $0.9 million which further contributed to the decline in gross margin.\nCorporate and other. Gross margin increased $0.2 million to $(7.9) million in 2017 from $(8.1) million in 2016. Items included in Corporate and other include expenses not allocated to our two operating segments. These costs include amortization of intangible assets, stock compensation and restructuring and other expenses. The increase was attributable to a $0.2 million decrease in stock based compensation expense.\nGross margin increased $0.1 million to $(8.1) million in 2016 from $(8.2) million in 2015. Items included in Corporate and other include expenses not allocated to our two operating segments.

R&D expenses decreased $0.7 million to $23.4 million in 2017 from $24.1 million in 2016. The expense reductions were the result of reduced headcount due to the Company's restructuring efforts in the fourth quarter of 2017. R&D headcount decreased to 231 at December 31, 2017 from 317 at December 31, 2016.\nR&D expenses decreased $1.5 million to $24.1 million in 2016 from $25.5 million in 2015. The expense reductions were the result of our restructuring efforts within our Hardware Solutions segment personnel reductions in Asia and North America and the concentration of R&D headcount to lower cost geographies and was largely completed by the end of the second quarter 2015. R&D headcount increased to 317 at December 31, 2016 from 310 at December 31, 2015.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nSG&A expenses consist primarily of salary, commissions, bonuses and benefits for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, as well as professional service providers and the costs of other general corporate activities. SG&A expenses decreased $0.9 million to $32.8 million in 2017 from $33.7 million in 2016. The expense reductions were the result of reduced headcount due to the Company's restructuring efforts in the fourth quarter of 2017. SG&A headcount decreased to 127 at December 31, 2017 from 139 at December 31, 2016.\nSG&A expenses increased $3.1 million to $33.7 million in 2016 from $30.6 million in 2015 primarily due to increases in salary, commissions and hiring related expenses of $2.3 million and an increase in marketing related expenses of $0.6 million, as the result of additions to sales and marketing headcount as well as increased product sales. SG&A headcount increased to 139 at December 31, 2016 from 112 at December 31, 2015.\nIntangible Assets Amortization\nIntangible assets amortization decreased $2.0 million to $3.0 million in 2017 from $5.0 million in 2016 due to routine amortization of acquired intangible assets and certain assets reaching the end of their useful lives. Intangible assets amortization in 2016 was comparable to 2015 due to routine amortization of acquired intangible assets. The amortization charges for each year were associated with the amortization of previously acquired intangible assets.\nWe perform impairment reviews of the purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. There have been no impairments of intangible assets recorded to date.\nRestructuring and Other Charges, Net\nRestructuring and other charges, net includes expenses associated with restructuring activities and other gains and losses which are not indicative of our ongoing business operations. Specifically, this may include costs incurred for employee severance, acquisition or divestiture activities, excess facility costs, certain legal costs, asset related charges and other expenses associated with business integration or restructuring activities. We evaluate the adequacy of the accrued restructuring charges on a quarterly basis. As a result, we record reversals to the accrued restructuring in the period in which we determine that expected restructuring and other obligations are less than the amounts accrued.\nRestructuring and other charges, net increased $5.4 million to $8.3 million in 2017 from $2.9 million in 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, restructuring and other charges include the following:\n \u2022 $5.5 million net expense relating to the severance for 92 employees primarily in connection with a restructuring of the Company's DCEngine product line, reducing the Company's hardware engineering presence in Shenzhen, China as well as reductions in North America due to the transition of the Company's supply chain operations to third party integration partners; an additional $0.8 million of expense will be recognized in 2018 over the notified employees' respective service terms; \n \u2022 $1.7 million fixed asset write offs related to DCEngine restructuring plans; \n \u2022 $1.0 million legal and other expense principally associated with contract termination costs and legal costs resulting from the Company's credit facility; and \n \u2022 $0.1 million lease abandonment expense associated with reductions in certain of our international sites. \nRestructuring and other charges, net decreased $2.1 million to $2.9 million in 2016 from $5.0 million in 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, restructuring and other charges include the following:\n \u2022 $2.8 million net expense relating to the severance for 74 employees primarily in connection with a reduction to our hardware engineering presence in Shenzhen, China as well as reductions in North America due to the transition of our supply chain operations to third party integration partners; and \n \u2022 $0.1 million integration-related net expense principally associated with asset disposals and transfer-related costs resulting from resource and site consolidation actions; \nStock-based Compensation Expense\nIncluded within costs of sales, R&D and SG&A are expenses associated with stock-based compensation.

Income (loss) from operations decreased by $28.4 million in 2017 to a loss of $18.6 million and was the result of the decline in DCEngine revenues coupled with the significant inventory charges recorded during 2017.\nIncome from operations increased by $0.1 million in 2016. The year over year income from operations was the result of $29.7 million and $28.3 million of previously described gross margin provided by this segment in 2016 and 2015. The $1.3 million increase to gross margin in 2016 was offset by increased sales and marketing expenses tied specifically to accelerating our DCEngine strategy.\nCorporate and other. Corporate and other loss from operations include amortization of intangible assets, stock compensation, restructuring and other expenses. Loss from operations increased by $1.8 million to $21.2 million in 2017 from $19.5 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $5.4 million in restructuring and other expenses offset by $2.0 million decrease in intangible amortization and $1.6 million decrease in stock based compensation expense.\nLoss from operations improved by $2.4 million to $19.5 million in 2016 from $21.9 million in 2015.

Our revolving line of credit had a balance ranging from $3.0 million to $45.0 million throughout the year. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 2016 is the result of higher interest rates under the credit line and carrying a higher average outstanding balance.\nIn 2016, interest expense includes interest incurred on our revolving line of credit. Our revolving line of credit had a balance ranging from $6.0 million to $25.0 million throughout the year. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2015 is the result of the repayment of the 2015 Convertible Notes on February 17, 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income, net decreased $3.0 million to an expense of $1.1 million in 2017 from income of $2.1 million in 2016. We recognized a $0.3 million loss on the realization of cumulative translation adjustments in the third quarter of 2017 associated with liquidation of a foreign entity as the result of previously announced restructuring actions. Additionally, the decrease is due to the decline of the US Dollar relative to the Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupee.\nOther income, net increased $0.6 million to $2.1 million in 2016 from $1.5 million in 2015. We recognized a $0.4 million gain on the realization of cumulative translation adjustments in the second quarter of 2016 associated with liquidation of three foreign entities as the result of previously announced restructuring actions. Additionally, changes are primarily due to cash flow hedge exchange rates between the Indian Rupee and the US Dollar and other currency movements, primarily the Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupee, against the US Dollar.\nIncome Tax Provision\nWe recorded income tax expense of $3.7 million, $2.4 million, and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Our current effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate in all periods due to a full valuation allowance provided against our U.S. net deferred tax assets, Indian dividend distribution tax and a partial valuation allowance against certain of our foreign deferred tax assets.\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had net deferred tax assets of $0.8 million and $1.1 million. We had valuation allowances of $77.4 million and $88.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, which represents a full valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets and a partial valuation allowance against certain of our foreign deferred tax assets. In evaluating our valuation allowance, we considered all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our foreign net deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance, resulting in a charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize all or a portion of the U.S. or foreign net deferred tax assets, we would reverse the previously provided valuation allowance. All future reversals of the valuation allowance would result in a benefit in the period recognized. Although realization is not assured, management believes that it is more likely than not that the balance of the deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance, as of December 31, 2017 will be realized.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign countries, and on occasion, we have been subject to corporate income tax audits. In determining the amount of income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, we have evaluated whether certain tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained by taxing authorities. We believe that we have adequately provided in our financial statements for additional taxes that may result from examination. To the extent the ultimate outcome of an examination differs from the amounts provided for as uncertain tax positions either additional expense or benefit will be recognized in the period in which the examination is effectively settled.\nWe are currently under tax examination in India and Canada. The periods under examination in India are the Company's financial years 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2011. The examinations are in various stages of appellate proceedings and all material uncertain tax positions associated with the examination have been taken into account in the ending balance of the unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017. The periods under examination in Canada are fiscal years 2013 and 2014. We reduced our Canadian tax attribute carryforwards and valuation allowance by $1.5 million as a settlement position related to a proposed adjustment by the Canada Revenue Agency.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act\u201d) was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact the company, most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act also provides for a one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings and the acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27, 2017 as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018, including repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction, acceleration of tax revenue recognition, capitalization of research and development expenditures, additional limitations on executive compensation and limitations on the deductibility of interest.\nWe recognized the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act in our 2017 financial statements in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provides SEC staff guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, in the reporting period in which the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. As such, our financial results reflect the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC Topic 740 is complete and provisional amounts for those specific income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC Topic 740 is incomplete but a reasonable estimate could be determined.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes selected financial information (in thousands): Table 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital\n</td> <td>(797\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable, net\n</td> <td>32,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories, net\n</td> <td>4,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable\n</td> <td>18,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of credit\n</td> <td>16,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents decreased by $25.0 million to $8.1 million at December 31, 2017 from $33.1 million at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the amount of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries was $1.4 million and the remaining $6.7 million was held in the U.S. We do not permanently reinvest funds in our foreign entities.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, principal drivers to changes in our working capital consisted of the following:\n \u2022 Accounts receivables decreased $5.5 million due to the decrease in fourth quarter revenues over 2016; \n \u2022 Accounts payable decreased $2.2 million due to the lower balances with our contract manufacturers resulting from the decline in DCEngine orders; \n \u2022 Deferred revenue decreased $2.8 million due to the recognition of DCEngine maintenance that was deferred at December 31, 2016 and subsequently recognized in 2017; and \n \u2022 Non-cash inventory charges of $18.0 million from restructuring of the DCEngine product line and last-time buys from customers for legacy embedded products and coupled with our decision to change contract manufacturers in Asia. \nCash provided by operating activities in 2016 was $9.8 million and consisted of a net loss of $10.3 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $24.6 million, which primarily consisted of intangible amortization, fixed asset depreciation, stock-based compensation expense and inventory valuation allowances, and an increase in working capital items of $4.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, principal drivers to changes in our working capital consisted of the following:\n \u2022 Accounts receivables and other receivables decreased $22.6 million due to DCEngine related collections from a tier-one U.S. service provider during the year and collection of related inventory sales to our integration partners in fulfilling these orders; \n \u2022 Accounts payable decreased $22.8 million due to the payment of inventory purchases made in the fourth quarter of 2015 in order to fulfill DCEngine orders shipped during 2016; \n \u2022 Deferred revenue decreased $15.0 million due to the recognition of DCEngine shipments that were deferred at December 31, 2015 and subsequently recognized in 2016; \n \u2022 Inventories and deferred cost of sales decreased $4.9 million tied to the significant DCEngine orders deferred at December 31, 2015 and recognized in 2016; and \n \u2022 Other receivables decreased $7.1 million as the result of collections from the sale of inventories to our integration partner and contract manufacturer. \nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities in 2017 and 2016 of $4.9 million was attributable to ongoing capital expenditures principally associated with our DCEngine product line.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities in 2017 of $8.6 million is primarily due to a $9.0 million net repayment on our Silicon Valley Bank line of credit and proceeds from the issuance of common stock. During 2017, our gross borrowings were $93.0 million and we repaid $102.0 million of the borrowings within the period. We expect to continue to borrow additional funds against our line of credit to meet short term intra-quarter needs on an ongoing basis; however, we expect to repay any such borrowings within the quarter as we navigate the timing of customer payments and payables to our suppliers.\nCash generated in financing activities in 2016 of $7.5 million is primarily due to a $10.0 million net draw on our Silicon Valley Bank line of credit and proceeds from the issuance of common stock. During 2016, our gross borrowings were $98.0 million and we repaid $88.0 million of the borrowings within the period. We expect to continue to borrow additional funds against our line of credit to meet short term intra-quarter needs on an ongoing basis; however, we expect to repay any such borrowings within the quarter as we navigate the timing of customer payments and payables to our suppliers. The draw on the line of credit was offset by the payment of payroll taxes associated with restricted stock award releases in the third quarter 2016.\nLine of Credit\nSilicon Valley Bank Credit Agreement\nOur primary source of liquidity, aside from our current working capital, was our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had an outstanding balance of $16.0 million and $25.0 million.\nOn January 3, 2018, concurrently with the Company's entry into the Note Purchase Agreement and the ABL Credit Agreement described below, the Company repaid in full and terminated the Credit Agreement, dated September 19, 2016, between the Company, as borrower, Silicon Valley Bank, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto, which provided for a three-year revolving credit facility with a $30.0 million revolving loan commitment.\nABL Credit Agreement\nOn January 3, 2018, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the ABL Credit Agreement\u201d) between Marquette Business Credit, LLC, as lender (the Lender\u201d), and the Company, as borrower. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility that provides financing of up to $20.0 million, with a $1.5 million sub-limit for letters of credit (the ABL Facility\u201d). Borrowings under the ABL Facility are subject to a borrowing base, which is a formula based upon certain eligible domestic accounts receivables, plus the lesser of (x) certain eligible foreign accounts receivables and (y) $20.0 million and minus certain established reserves and the amount of certain other funds held in blocked accounts. The ABL Credit Agreement matures on January 3, 2021.\nOutstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the applicable base rate, which is the higher of (i) the prime rate then in effect and (ii) LIBOR plus 2.00%, plus, in each case, 1.00% and is payable monthly in arrears. During the continuance of a default or event of default, borrowings under the ABL Facility will bear interest at a rate 2.00% above the otherwise applicable interest rate. Under the ABL Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.375% per annum based on the average unused portion of the revolving loan commitment and certain other fees in connection with the origination of the ABL Facility and the issuance of letters of credit. In connection with the early termination of the ABL Facility, the Company will also be required to pay (x) a fee equal to 2.00% of the total revolving loan commitment if termination occurs on or prior to January 3, 2019 and (y) 1.00% of the total revolving loan commitment if termination occurs after January 3, 2019 and on or prior to January 3, 2020. There is no early termination fee if the ABL Facility is terminated after January 3, 2020.\nThe ABL Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, covenants, indemnities and conditions, in each case, that the Company believes are customary for transactions of this type. Pursuant to the terms of the ABL Credit Agreement, the Company is required to meet certain financial and other restrictive covenants, including maintaining a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) and not exceeding maximum capital expenditures in any fiscal year (each as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement), not exceeding certain thresholds for Cash Loss After Debt Service (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) and. Additionally, the Company is also prohibited from taking certain actions without consent of the Lender, including, without limitation, incurring additional indebtedness, entering into certain mergers or other business combination transactions, disposing of or permitting liens or other encumbrances on the Company's assets and making restricted payments, including cash dividends on shares of the Company's common stock, in each case, except as expressly permitted under the ABL Credit Agreement. The ABL Credit Agreement contains events of default that the Company believes are customary for transactions of this type. If a default occurs and is not cured within the applicable cure period or is not waived, any outstanding obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement may be accelerated.\nThe ABL Facility is guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors (as defined below). The Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the ABL Facility and any guarantee of the ABL Facility (and certain related obligations) are secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral. The Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the ABL Facility and any guarantee of the ABL Facility (and certain related obligations) have first-priority in the waterfall set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement in respect of the liens on the Collateral constituting, among other things, accounts, inventory and cash of the Borrower and the Guarantors (collectively, the ABL Priority Collateral\u201d). The Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the ABL Facility and any guarantee of the ABL facility (and certain related obligations) have second-priority in the waterfall set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement in respect of the liens on the Term Priority Collateral (as defined below). As described below, the Company must also maintaining minimum cash balances in a restricted deposit account of $4.0 million through June 30, 2018 and $6.0 million on and after July 1, 2018, which will secure both the obligations under the Notes and the ABL Facility.\nThe Company paid approximately $2.0 million in debt issuance fees which will be capitalized and expensed over the term of the Note Purchase Agreement.\nHale Capital Note Purchase Agreement\nOn January 3, 2018, the Company also entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) among the Company, as borrower, the Guarantors (as defined below) from time to time party thereto, the purchasers from time to time party thereto (collectively, the Purchasers\u201d) and HCP-FVG, LLC, an affiliate of Hale Capital Partners LP, as collateral agent and as a Purchaser (\"Hale Capital\"). Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers senior secured promissory notes in an aggregate original principal amount of $17.0 million (the \"Notes\").\nThe Notes bear interest at a rate equal to the greater of 4.50% or the prime rate plus 5.75% (currently 10.25% per year), payable monthly in arrears. For any interest payment date occurring on or prior to August 31, 2018, the monthly interest payment will be paid in the form of additional Notes (unless an event of default has occurred and is continuing, in which case all interest shall be paid in cash). Thereafter, the interest will be payable monthly in cash in arrears. Interest on the Notes will\nbe computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprising twelve 30-day months. During the continuance of a default or event of default, the Notes will bear interest at a rate 5.00% above the otherwise applicable interest rate.\nThe maturity date of the Notes is January 3, 2021 (the Term Maturity Date\u201d). The Company is required to redeem the Notes in principal installments of (i) $1.5 million payable on August 31, 2018, (ii) $1.75 million payable on the last day of the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2018, (iii) $1.25 million payable on the last day of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2018 and (iv) $1.5 million payable on the last day of each fiscal quarter beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019 and continuing through the last full fiscal quarter prior to the Term Maturity Date. In addition, the Company will be required to redeem all of the Notes upon a change of control and will be required to make certain mandatory redemptions of the Notes with (x) the net proceeds of any voluntary or involuntary sale or disposition of assets (including casualty losses and condemnation awards, subject to certain exceptions) and (y) 33% of the net proceeds from the issuance or sale of any equity (unless an event of default exists under the Note Purchase Agreement, in which case it will be 100% of the net proceeds), subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The Company may also redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time.\nAll redemptions of the Notes (whether mandatory, optional or as result of the acceleration of the Notes) are subject to a prepayment fee as follows: (i) if a prepayment is on or before January 3, 2020, 5% of the principal prepaid; and (ii) if prepayment is on or after January 4, 2020 and on or before January 2, 2021, 3% of the principal prepaid.\nThe Note Purchase Agreement contains representations and warranties, covenants, indemnities and conditions, in each case, that the Company believes are customary for transactions of this type. Under the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company is required to meet certain financial and other restrictive covenants, including maintaining a minimum Coverage Ratio and Total Liquidity (each as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement), maintaining the amount of negative cumulative cash flow from operations below an agreed threshold, maintaining certain minimum levels of revenue and not exceeding a maximum long-term deferred revenue threshold. Additionally, the Company and its subsidiaries are also prohibited from taking certain actions without consent of the Purchasers, including, without limitation, incurring additional indebtedness, entering into certain mergers or other business combination transactions, disposing of or permitting liens or other encumbrances on their assets, making restricted payments, including cash dividends on shares of the Company's common stock, and other investments and making capital expenditures in excess of certain thresholds, in each case, except as otherwise expressly permitted under the Note Purchase Agreement. The Note Purchase Agreement contains events of default that the Company believes are customary for transactions of this type. If a default occurs and is not cured within the applicable cure period or is not waived, any outstanding obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement may be accelerated.\nThe Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company's U.S. subsidiary, Radisys International LLC ( Radisys International\u201d). Each of its future material domestic subsidiaries will also be required to guarantee the Notes on a senior secured basis (collectively with Radisys International, the Guarantors\u201d). The Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the Notes and any guarantee of the Notes (and certain related obligations) are secured by substantially all of the Company's and the Guarantors' tangible and intangible assets, subject to specified exceptions (the Collateral\u201d). The Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the Notes and any guarantee of the Notes (and certain related obligations) have first-priority in the waterfall set forth in an intercreditor agreement entered into in connection with the Notes and the ABL Facility (the Intercreditor Agreement\u201d) in respect of the liens on the Collateral other than the ABL Priority Collateral (the Term Priority Collateral\u201d). The Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the Notes and any guarantee of the Notes (and certain related obligations) have second-priority in the waterfall set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement in respect of the liens on the ABL Priority Collateral. The Company must also maintain at least $4.0 million in cash in a restricted deposit account at UMB Bank, n.a. or at a restricted deposit account designated by Hale Capital through June 30, 2018 and at least $6.0 million in cash in a restricted deposit account at UMB Bank, n.a. or at a restricted deposit account designated by Hale Capital on and after July 1, 2018. The amount in the restricted account will secure both the obligations under the Notes and the ABL Facility.\n2015 Convertible Senior Notes\nOn February 17, 2015, we repaid at maturity the entire $18.0 million outstanding balance of the 4.50% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the \"2015 convertible senior notes\") in accordance with the terms thereof. No convertible senior notes were converted to common stock.\nDerivatives\nWe enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts for the Indian Rupee to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange risks where natural hedging strategies could not be effectively employed.\nWe do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The purpose of our hedging activities is to reduce the risk that the eventual cash flows of the underlying assets, liabilities and firm commitments will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. In general, our hedging activities do not create foreign currency exchange rate risk because fluctuations in the value of the instruments used for hedging purposes are offset by fluctuations in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged. Counterparties to derivative financial instruments expose us to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance. We do not believe there is a significant credit risk associated with our hedging activities because the counterparties are all large financial institutions with high credit ratings.\nAll derivatives, including foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Unrealized gain positions are recorded as other current assets and unrealized loss positions are recorded as other current liabilities. Changes in the fair values of the outstanding derivatives that are highly effective are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) until net income (loss) is affected by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged transaction. Hedge ineffectiveness may result when the amount of our hedge contracts exceed our forecasted or actual transactions for which the hedge contracts were designed to hedge. Once a hedge contract matures the associated gain (loss) on the contract will remain in other comprehensive income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income (loss), at which time the gain (loss) will be recorded to the expense line item being hedged, which is primarily Cost of Sales, R&D and SG&A. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward foreign currency exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their nature, estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. If anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels, or when the timing of transactions change significantly, we would reclassify a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income (loss) to other income (expense) during the quarter in which the changes occur.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 and the effect of such on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in thousands):\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019-2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021-2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023 & Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (A)\n</td> <td>3,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of credit (B)\n</td> <td>16,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (A) Purchase obligations include agreements or purchase orders to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. These purchase obligations are entered into in the ordinary course of business and are expected to be funded by cash flows from continuing operations. (B) The secured revolving line of credit agreement was replaced on January 3, 2018. See Note 19 - Subsequent Events \nIn addition to the above, we have approximately $4.6 million in liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not engage in any activity involving special purpose entities or off-balance sheet financing.\nShelf Registration Statement\nOn August 3, 2016, we filed an unallocated shelf registration statement on Form S-3 for the offering from time to time of up to $100.0 million in securities consisting of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, debt securities or units consisting of one or more of these securities. The SEC declared the shelf registration statement effective on August 12, 2016, and it will expire in August 2019. Except as may be stated in a prospectus supplement for any particular offering, we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities for general corporate purposes, which may include acquiring companies in our industry and related businesses, repaying existing debt, providing additional working capital and procuring capital assets.\nLiquidity Outlook\nOver the past several quarters, we have experienced significant operating losses and more recently consumed significant cash from operations resulting from a material decline in its DCEngine product line. Given the uncertainty of future business from the DCEngine product line, we began taking action in the fourth quarter of 2017 to significantly reduce our overhead and operating expenses moving forward aimed at enabling us to return to profitability and free cash flow generation. These actions also included closing the new financing arrangements subsequent to December 31, 2017, which positioned us to implement the expense reduction actions as well as committed inventory purchases through the first half of 2018.\nA return to profitability and free cash flow generation is based on certain assumptions and projections, including growth from our Software-Systems business. If we are unable to attain certain levels of revenue growth, or meet our cost reduction targets, we may be out of compliance with covenants associated with the new financing arrangements which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nAt December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents amounted to $8.1 million. We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, the proceeds from the sale of the Notes, cash expected to be generated from operations, available borrowings under ABL Credit Agreement and availability, if required, under our $100.0 million unallocated shelf registration statement will satisfy our short and long-term expected working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, and other liquidity requirements associated with our present business operations. If we are unable to comply with various covenants under the ABL Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement due to the timing of orders and shipments from our Software-Systems customers, delays in payment of accounts receivable or other adverse business conditions that impact our operating plans, without an amendment or waiver, our liquidity outlook could be materially and adversely affected. We continue to pursue a number of actions to improve our cash position including (i) minimizing capital expenditures, (ii) effectively managing working capital, (iii) seeking amendments or waivers from lenders and (iv) improving cash flows from operations. These efforts continue in earnest and we are considering all available strategic alternatives and financing possibilities, including, without limitation, the issuance of additional equity, the incurrence of additional secured indebtedness and the exchange or refinancing of existing obligations. In addition, we have from time to time received inquiries and initiated discussions regarding potential strategic alternatives, including inquiries and discussions regarding a possible sale of the Company. We will likely continue to receive inquiries and initiate discussions regarding potential strategic alternatives in the future. We currently have no agreements or commitments to engage in any specific strategic transactions, but we may enter into such a transaction at any time.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and revenues and expenses.
