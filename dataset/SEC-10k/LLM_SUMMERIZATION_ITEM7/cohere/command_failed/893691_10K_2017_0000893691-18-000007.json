Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is based upon accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and discusses the financial condition and results of operations for Masonite International Corporation for the years ended December 31, 2017, January 1, 2017, and January 3, 2016. In this MD&A, \"Masonite,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" and the \"Company\" refer to Masonite International Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the disclosure under \"Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\" and Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\", elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties.\nOverview\nWe are a leading global designer, manufacturer and distributor of interior and exterior doors for the new construction and repair, renovation and remodeling sectors of the residential and non-residential building construction markets. Since 1925, we have provided our customers with innovative products and superior service at compelling values. In order to better serve our customers and create sustainable competitive advantages, we focus on developing innovative products, advanced manufacturing capabilities and technology-driven sales and service solutions.\nWe market and sell our products to remodeling contractors, builders, homeowners, retailers, dealers, lumberyards, commercial and general contractors and architects through well-established wholesale, retail and direct distribution channels as part of our cross-merchandising strategy. Customers are provided a broad product offering of interior and exterior doors and entry systems at various price points. We manufacture a broad line of interior doors, including residential molded, flush, stile and rail, louver and specially-ordered commercial and architectural doors; door components for internal use and sale to other door manufacturers; and exterior residential steel, fiberglass and wood doors and entry systems.\nWe operate 64 manufacturing and distribution facilities in 8 countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, which are strategically located to serve our customers through multiple distribution channels. These distribution channels include: (i) direct distribution to retail home center customers; (ii) one-step distribution that sells directly to homebuilders and contractors; and (iii) two-step distribution through wholesale distributors. For retail home center customers, numerous door fabrication facilities provide value-added fabrication and logistical services, including pre-finishing and store delivery of pre-hung interior and exterior doors. We believe our ability to provide: (i) a broad product range; (ii) frequent, rapid, on-time and complete delivery; (iii) consistency in products and merchandising; (iv) national service; and (v) special order programs enables retail customers to increase comparable store sales and helps to differentiate us from our competitors. We believe investments in innovative new product manufacturing and distribution capabilities, coupled with an ongoing commitment to operational excellence, provide a strong platform for future growth.\nOur reportable segments are currently organized and managed principally by end market: North American Residential, Europe and Architectural. In the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated net sales of $1,428.9 million or 70.3%, $291.9 million or 14.4% and $288.5 million or 14.2% in our North American Residential, Europe and Architectural segments, respectively. See \"Components of Results of Operations - Segment Information\" below for a description of our reportable segments.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nProduct Demand\nThere are numerous factors that influence overall market demand for our products. Demand for new homes, home improvement products and other building construction products have a direct impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Demand for our products may be impacted by changes in United States, Canadian, European, Asian or other global economic conditions, including inflation, deflation, interest rates, availability of capital, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs, and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Additionally, trends in residential new construction, repair, renovation and remodeling and architectural building\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nconstruction may directly impact our financial performance. Accordingly, the following factors may have a direct impact on our business in the countries and regions in which our products are sold:\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the strength of the economy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the amount and type of residential and commercial construction;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>housing sales and home values;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the age of existing home stock, home vacancy rates and foreclosures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>non-residential building occupancy rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increases in the cost of raw materials or wages or any shortage in supplies or labor;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the availability and cost of credit;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>employment rates and consumer confidence; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>demographic factors such as immigration and migration of the population and trends in household formation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Additionally, the United Kingdom's formal trigger of the two year process for its exit from the European Union, and related negotiations, has created uncertainty in European demand, particularly in the United Kingdom, which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products in the foreseeable future.\nProduct Pricing and Mix\nThe building products industry is highly competitive and we therefore face pressure on sales prices of our products. In addition, our competitors may adopt more aggressive sales policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do, which could result in a loss of customers. Our business in general is subject to changing consumer and industry trends, demands and preferences. Trends within the industry change often and our failure to anticipate, identify or quickly react to changes in these trends could lead to, among other things, rejection of a new product line and reduced demand and price reductions for our products, which could materially adversely affect us. Changes in consumer preferences may also lead to increased demand for our lower margin products relative to our higher margin products, which could reduce our future profitability.\nBusiness Wins and Losses\nOur customers consist mainly of wholesalers and retail home centers. In fiscal year 2017, our top ten customers together accounted for approximately 44% of our net sales and our top customer, The Home Depot, Inc. accounted for approximately 18% of our net sales in fiscal year 2017. Net sales from customers that have accounted for a significant portion of our net sales in past periods, individually or as a group, may not continue in future periods, or if continued, may not reach or exceed historical levels in any period. Certain customers perform periodic product line reviews to assess their product offerings, which have, on past occasions, led to business wins and losses. In addition, as a result of competitive bidding processes, we may not be able to increase or maintain the margins at which we sell our products to our customers.\nOrganizational Restructuring\nOver the past several years we have initiated, and in the future we may initiate, restructuring plans designed to eliminate excess capacity in order to align our manufacturing capabilities with reductions in demand, as well as to streamline our organizational structure and reposition our business for improved long-term profitability.\nDuring 2016, we began implementing a plan (the \"2016 Plan\") to close one manufacturing facility in the Architectural segment, which included the reduction of approximately 140 positions. The 2016 Plan was implemented to improve our cost structure and enhance operational efficiencies. Costs associated with the 2016 Plan include closure costs and severance and the 2016 Plan is substantially completed. As of December 31, 2017, we do not expect to incur any future charges relating to the 2016 Plan. The actions taken as part of the 2016 Plan are expected to increase our annual earnings and cash flows by approximately $4 million.\nDuring 2015, we began implementing a multi-year plan to reorganize and consolidate certain aspects of our global head office (the \"2015 Plan\"). The 2015 Plan includes the creation of a new shared services function and the rationalization of certain of our European facilities, including related headcount reductions. The 2015 Plan was implemented in response to the need for more effective business processes enabled by the planned implementation of our\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nnew enterprise resource planning system in our architectural business as well as ongoing weak market conditions in Africa and Europe outside of the United Kingdom. Costs associated with the 2015 Plan included severance and closure charges and are substantially completed. As of December 31, 2017, we do not expect to incur any material future charges for the 2015 Plan. Once fully implemented, the actions taken as part of the 2015 Plan are estimated to increase our annual earnings and cash flows by approximately $6 million.\nForeign Exchange Rate Fluctuation\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuating exchange rates. In the years ended December 31, 2017, January 1, 2017, and January 3, 2016 approximately 34%, 35% and 36% of our net sales were generated outside of the United States, respectively. In addition, a significant percentage of our costs during the same period were not denominated in U.S. dollars. For example, for most of our manufacturing and distribution facilities, the prices for a significant portion of our raw materials are quoted in the domestic currency of the country where the facility is located or other currencies that are not U.S. dollars. We also have substantial assets outside the United States. As a result, the volatility in the price of the U.S. dollar has exposed, and in the future may continue to expose, us to currency exchange risks. Also, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on many aspects of our financial results. Changes in currency exchange rates for any country in which we operate may require us to raise the prices of our products in that country or allow our competitors to sell their products at lower prices in that country. Unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of the financial statements of our non-U.S. functional currency operations are accumulated in the cumulative translation adjustments account in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Net gains from currency translation adjustments as a result of translating our foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars during the year ended December 31, 2017, were $39.0 million, which were primarily driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the other major currencies in which we transact.\nInflation\nAn increase in inflation could have a significant impact on the cost of our raw material inputs. Wage inflation, increased prices for raw materials or finished goods used in our products and/or interruptions in deliveries of raw materials or finished goods could adversely affect our profitability, margins and net sales, particularly if we are not able to pass these incurred costs on to our customers. In addition, interest rates normally increase during periods of rising inflation. Historically, as interest rates increase, demand for new homes and home improvement products decreases. An environment of gradual interest rate increases may, however, signify an improving economy or increasing real estate values, which in turn may stimulate increased home buying activity.\nSeasonality\nOur business is moderately seasonal and our net sales vary from quarter to quarter based upon the timing of the building season in our markets. Severe weather conditions in any quarter, such as unusually prolonged warm or cold conditions, rain, blizzards or hurricanes, could accelerate, delay or halt construction and renovation activity.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nWe are pursuing a strategic initiative of optimizing our global business portfolio. As part of this strategy, in the last several years we have pursued strategic acquisitions targeting companies who produce components for our existing operations, manufacture niche products and provide value-added services. Additionally, we target companies with strong brands, complementary technologies, attractive geographic footprints and opportunities for cost and distribution synergies. We also continuously analyze our operations to determine which businesses, market channels and products create the most value for our customers and acceptable returns for our shareholders.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nAcquisitions\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>DW3: On January 29, 2018, we completed the acquisition of DW3 Products Holdings Limited ( DW3\u201d), a leading UK provider of high quality premium door solutions and window systems, supplying products under brand names such as Solidor, Residor, Nicedor and Residence. We acquired 100% of the equity interests in DW3 for consideration of approximately $96 million, net of cash acquired. DW3 is based in Stoke-on-Trent and Gloucester, England, and their products and service model are a natural addition to our existing UK business. DW3's online quick ship capabilities and product portfolio both complement and expand the strategies we are pursuing with our business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A&F: On October 2, 2017 we completed the acquisition of A&F Wood Products, Inc.

As a result of this plan, a Business Rescue Practitioner was appointed to manage the affairs of the business and we no longer maintained operational control over MAL. For this reason, we deconsolidated MAL effective December 22, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Subsequent to deconsolidation, we used the cost method to account for our equity investment in MAL, which was reflected as $10.0 million in our consolidated balance sheets as of January 1, 2017, based on the estimated fair value of our portion of MAL's net assets on the date of deconsolidation. During September 2016, we received $15.1 million as final pre-tax proceeds from the sale of our equity interest in MAL. Upon receipt of these proceeds, our equity interest in MAL was eliminated and we accordingly reduced the value of our cost investment in MAL to zero and recorded a gain on disposal of subsidiaries of $5.1 million.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>France: On July 31, 2015, we completed the sale of all of the capital stock of Premdor, S.A.S., Masonite's door business in France, to a Paris-based independent investment firm (the \"Buyer\"). Pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated July 16, 2015, the Buyer acquired all of Masonite's door manufacturing and distribution business in France for nominal consideration.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComponents of Results of Operations\nNet Sales\nNet sales are derived from the sale of products to our customers. We recognize sales of our products when an agreement with the customer in the form of a sales order is in place, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collection is reasonably assured and the customer has taken ownership and assumes risk of loss. Certain customers are eligible to participate in various incentive and rebate programs considered as a reduction of the sales price of our products. Accordingly, net sales are reported net of such incentives and rebates. Additionally, shipping and other transportation costs charged to customers are recorded in net sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nCost of Goods Sold\nOur cost of goods sold is comprised of the cost to manufacture products for our customers and includes the cost of materials, direct labor, overhead, distribution and depreciation associated with assets used to manufacture products. Research and development costs are primarily included within cost of goods sold. We incur significant fixed and variable overhead at our global component locations that manufacture interior molded door facings. Our overall average production capacity utilization at these locations was approximately 77%, 77%, and 68% for the years ended December 31, 2017, January 1, 2017, and January 3, 2016.\nSelling, General and Administration Expenses\nSelling, general and administration expenses primarily include the costs for our sales organization and support staff at various plants and corporate offices. These costs include personnel costs for payroll, related benefits and stock based compensation expense; professional fees including legal, accounting and consulting fees; depreciation and amortization of our non-manufacturing equipment and assets; travel and entertainment expenses; director, officer and other insurance policies; environmental, health and safety costs; advertising expenses and rent and utilities related to administrative office facilities. Certain charges that are also incurred less frequently and are included in selling, general and administration costs include gain or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment and bad debt expense.\nRestructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs include all salary-related severance benefits that are accrued and expensed when a restructuring plan has been put into place, the plan has received approval from the appropriate level of management and the benefit is probable and reasonably estimable. In addition to salary-related costs, we incur other restructuring costs when facilities are closed or capacity is realigned within the organization. Upon termination of a contract we record liabilities and expenses pursuant to the terms of the relevant agreement. For non-contractual restructuring activities, liabilities and expenses are measured and recorded at fair value in the period in which they are incurred.\nAsset Impairment\nAsset impairment includes charges that are taken when impairment testing indicates that the carrying values of our long-lived assets or asset groups exceed their respective fair values. Definite-lived assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are tested annually for impairment on the last day of fiscal November, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of the asset or asset group being tested exceeds its fair value, except in the case of goodwill, which is tested based on the fair value of the reporting unit where the goodwill is recorded.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nLoss (Gain) on Disposal of Subsidiaries\nLoss (gain) on disposal of subsidiaries represents the difference between proceeds received upon disposition and the book value of a subsidiary which has been divested and was excluded from treatment as a discontinued operation. Also included in loss (gain) on disposal of subsidiaries is recognition of the cumulative translation adjustment out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net relates primarily to our consolidated senior unsecured indebtedness. Subsequent to March 23, 2015, interest expense, net relates to our $625.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2023 (the \"2023 Notes\"). Prior to March 23, 2015, interest expense related to our $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2021, which were redeemed on March 23, 2015, concurrent with the issuance of the 2023 Notes. Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the 2023 Notes were capitalized as a reduction to the carrying value of debt and are being accreted to interest expense over their respective terms. The most recent issuance of our 2023 Notes resulted in a premium that is amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2023 Notes. Additionally, we pay interest on any outstanding principal under our ABL Facility and we are required to pay a commitment fee for unutilized commitments under the ABL Facility, both of which are recorded in interest expense as incurred.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt represents the difference between the reacquisition price of debt and the net carrying amount of the extinguished debt. The net carrying amount includes the principal, unamortized premium and unamortized debt issuance costs.\nOther Expense (Income), Net\nOther expense (income), net includes profits and losses related to our non-majority owned unconsolidated subsidiaries that we recognize under the equity method of accounting, unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency remeasurements, pension settlement charges and other miscellaneous non-operating expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the deferred tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is anticipated to be realized on a more likely than not basis. Our combined effective income tax rate is primarily the weighted average of federal, state and provincial rates in various countries where we have operations, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Our income tax rate is also affected by estimates of our ability to realize tax assets and changes in tax laws.\nOn December 22, 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Reform\"). Among other items, Tax Reform reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. This has caused our net deferred tax liabilities in the U.S. to be revalued.\nSegment Information\nOur reportable segments are organized and managed principally by end market: North American Residential, Europe and Architectural. The North American Residential reportable segment is the aggregation of the Wholesale and Retail operating segments. The Europe reportable segment is the aggregation of the United Kingdom, Central Eastern Europe and France (prior to disposal) operating segments. The Architectural reportable segment consists solely of the Architectural operating segment. The Corporate & Other category includes unallocated corporate costs and the results of immaterial operating segments which were not aggregated into any reportable segment, including the historical results of our Africa operating segment (prior to deconsolidation). Operating segments are aggregated into reportable segments only if they exhibit similar economic characteristics. In addition to similar economic characteristics we also consider the\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nfollowing factors in determining the reportable segments: the nature of business activities, the management structure directly accountable to our chief operating decision maker for operating and administrative activities, availability of discrete financial information and information presented to the Board of Directors and investors.\nOur management reviews net sales and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Net assets are not allocated to the reportable segments. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which does not have a standardized meaning under GAAP and is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to either net income or operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Masonite adjusted to exclude the following items:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>depreciation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>amortization;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>share based compensation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>loss (gain) on disposal of property, plant and equipment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>registration and listing fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>restructuring costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>asset impairment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>loss (gain) on disposal of subsidiaries;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>interest expense (income), net;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>loss on extinguishment of debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other expense (income), net;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>income tax expense (benefit);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>loss (income) from discontinued operations, net of tax; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> This definition of Adjusted EBITDA differs from the definitions of EBITDA contained in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes and the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility. Adjusted EBITDA is used to evaluate and compare the performance of the segments and it is one of the primary measures used to determine employee incentive compensation. Intersegment transfers are negotiated on an arm's length basis, using market prices.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA, from an operations standpoint, provides an appropriate way to measure and assess segment performance. Our management team has established the practice of reviewing the performance of each segment based on the measures of net sales and Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to users of the consolidated financial statements because it provides the same information that we use internally to evaluate and compare the performance of the segments and it is one of the primary measures used to determine employee incentive compensation.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nResults of Operations Table 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 3, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,032,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,973,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,871,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>1,625,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,564,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,521,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>406,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>409,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit as a % of net sales\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administration expenses\n</td> <td>246,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>260,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>244,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administration expenses as a % of net sales\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring costs, net\n</td> <td>850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss (gain) on disposal of subsidiaries\n</td> <td>212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,575\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>159,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense (income), net\n</td> <td>30,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense (income), net\n</td> <td>(1,091\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,959\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,757\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>130,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,569\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>(27,560\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations\n</td> <td>157,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41,741\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>(583\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(752\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(908\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>156,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,649\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest\n</td> <td>5,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to Masonite\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(47,111\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2017, Compared with Year Ended January 1, 2017\nNet Sales\nNet sales in the year ended December 31, 2017, were $2,032.9 million, an increase of $58.9 million or 3.0% from $1,974.0 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Net sales in 2017 were negatively impacted by $6.6 million as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $65.5 million or 3.3% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Average unit price in 2017 increased net sales by $47.4 million or 2.4% compared to 2016. Higher volume in 2017 increased net sales by $21.9 million or 1.1% compared to 2016. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased net sales of components and other products to external customers, which were $3.8 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016. The change in volume includes the incremental impacts of acquisitions and dispositions.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nNet Sales and Percentage of Net Sales by Reportable Segment Table 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 1, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Residential\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,433,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,357,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Residential intersegment\n</td> <td>(4,338\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,926\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Residential net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>1,428,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,351,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>70.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe\n</td> <td>295,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe intersegment\n</td> <td>(3,936\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,543\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>291,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>301,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Architectural\n</td> <td>307,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>312,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Architectural intersegment\n</td> <td>(18,773\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,353\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Architectural net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>288,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate & Other net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>23,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,032,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,973,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNorth American Residential\nNet sales to external customers from facilities in the North American Residential segment in the year ended December 31, 2017, were $1,428.9 million, an increase of $77.6 million or 5.7% from $1,351.3 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Net sales in 2017 were positively impacted by $5.0 million as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $72.6 million or 5.4% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Higher volume in 2017 increased net sales by $44.0 million or 3.3% compared to 2016. Average unit price increased net sales in 2017 by $30.5 million or 2.3% compared to 2016. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased net sales of components and other products to external customers, which were $1.9 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016.\nEurope\nNet sales to external customers from facilities in the Europe segment in the year ended December 31, 2017, were $291.9 million, a decrease of $9.3 million or 3.1% from $301.2 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Net sales in 2017 were negatively impacted by $12.1 million as a result of foreign exchange fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $2.8 million or 0.9% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Average unit price increased net sales in 2017 by $5.6 million or 1.9% compared to 2016. Higher volume in 2017 increased net sales by $0.3 million or 0.1% compared to 2016. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased net sales of components and other products to external customers, which were $3.1 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016.\nArchitectural\nNet sales to external customers from facilities in the Architectural segment in the year ended December 31, 2017, were $288.5 million, a decrease of $9.4 million or 3.2% from $297.9 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Net sales in 2017 were positively impacted by $0.6 million as a result of foreign exchange fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have decreased by $10.0 million or 3.4% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Lower volume decreased net sales in 2017 by $23.2 million or 7.8%\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\ncompared to 2016. Partially offsetting this decrease, average unit price increased net sales in 2017 by $11.3 million or 3.8% compared to 2016. Net sales of components and other products to external customers were $1.9 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016. The change in volume includes the incremental impact of acquisitions and dispositions.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 80.0% and 79.2% for the years ended December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2017, respectively. Distribution, overhead and direct labor as a percentage of sales increased by 0.9%, 0.6% and 0.2%, respectively, over the 2016 period. The distribution increase was due to inflationary pressures, shipping inefficiencies related to maintaining customer service levels and costs to complete the ramp-up of new retail business. The overhead and direct labor increases were driven by operational inefficiencies and wage inflation, partly offset by headcount reductions. Material cost of sales and depreciation as a percentage of net sales in 2017 decreased 0.8% and 0.1%, respectively, over the 2016 period. The decrease in material cost of sales was driven by favorable average unit prices partially offset by a combination of inflation and inbound freight increases.\nSelling, General and Administration Expenses\nIn the year ended December 31, 2017, selling, general and administration expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 12.1% compared to 13.2% in the year ended January 1, 2017, a decrease of 110 basis points.\nSelling, general and administration expenses in the year ended December 31, 2017, were $246.9 million, a decrease of $13.5 million from $260.4 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. The decrease included a $6.3 million reduction of non-cash items in SG&A expenses, including share based compensation, depreciation and amortization, deferred compensation and loss on sale of fixed assets. The overall decrease was also driven by a $12.2 million decrease in personnel costs, primarily due to a reduction in our incentive pay accrual, and favorable foreign exchange impacts of $1.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by a $3.6 million increase in marketing costs relating to our re-branding, a net incremental increase of $0.5 million due to acquisitions and other increases of $2.3 million.\nRestructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs in the year ended December 31, 2017, were $0.9 million, compared to $1.4 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Restructuring costs in 2017 related to the final severance and closure costs for the 2016 plan, partly offset by the receipt of $1.1 million as final settlement in the Stay of Proceedings in Israel as part of the 2014 Plan and other reductions to the 2014 Plan accrual. Restructuring costs in 2016 primarily related to the severance costs incurred during the implementation of the 2016 Plan.\nAsset Impairment\nAsset impairment charges were $1.5 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. There were no asset impairment charges in the year ended December 31, 2017. Asset impairment charges in 2016 resulted from restructuring actions associated with the 2016 Plan.\nLoss (Gain) on Disposal of Subsidiaries\nLoss on disposal of subsidiaries was $0.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the gain on disposal of subsidiaries of $6.6 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. The current year loss arose as a result of the liquidation of our legal entity in Hungary. The gain in 2016 arose as a result of the sale of our equity interest in MAL and the liquidation of our legal entity in Romania. The current year loss and the prior year gain related to Hungary and Romania are comprised of the recognition of the cumulative translation adjustment out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The prior year gain relating to MAL represents the excess of pre-tax cash received upon closing of the sale over the book value of the investment.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net, in the year ended December 31, 2017, was $30.2 million, compared to $28.2 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. This increase primarily relates to the issuance of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional 2023 Senior Notes on September 27, 2017.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nOther Expense (Income), Net\nOther expense (income), net, in the year ended December 31, 2017, was $(1.1) million, compared to $(2.0) million in the year ended January 1, 2017. The change in other expense (income), net, is primarily due to unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency remeasurements. Also contributing to the change were our portion of dividends and the net gains and losses related to our non-majority owned unconsolidated subsidiaries that are recognized under the equity method of accounting and other miscellaneous non-operating expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nOur income tax (benefit) in the year ended December 31, 2017, was $(27.6) million, a change of $49.3 million from $21.8 million of income tax expense in the year ended January 1, 2017. The increase in income tax benefit is primarily attributable to recognition of $24.1 million of deferred tax assets in Canada through reversal of valuation allowances, a $27.2 million increase in income tax benefit associated with the change in enacted tax rate applied to existing U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities due to U.S. Tax Reform, the mix of income or losses within the tax jurisdictions with various tax rates in which we operate and losses in tax jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances as of December 31, 2017.\nSegment Information Table 113: <table><tr><td>

from $212.6 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA in the North American Residential segment included corporate allocations of shared costs of $54.7 million and $50.7 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The allocations generally consist of certain costs of human resources, legal, finance, information technology, research and development and share based compensation.\nAdjusted EBITDA in our Europe segment decreased $5.2 million, or 13.4%, to $33.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, from $38.8 million in the year ended January 1, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA in our Architectural segment increased $4.9 million or 19.4% to $30.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, from $25.2 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA in the Architectural segment also included corporate allocations of shared costs of $8.9 million and $7.8 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The allocations generally consist of certain costs of human resources, legal, finance and information technology.\nYear Ended January 1, 2017, Compared with Year Ended January 3, 2016\nOur fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday closest to December 31. In a 52-week year, each fiscal quarter consists of 13 weeks. For ease of disclosure, the 13-week periods are referred to as three-month periods and the 52- or 53-week periods are referred to as years. Our 2015 fiscal year, which ended on January 3, 2016, contained 53 weeks of operating results, with the additional week occurring in the fourth quarter.\nNet Sales\nNet sales in the year ended January 1, 2017, were $1,974.0 million, an increase of $102.0 million or 5.4% from $1,872.0 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Net sales in 2016 were negatively impacted by $47.4 million as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $149.4 million or 8.0% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Higher volume in 2016 increased net sales by $99.2 million or 5.3% compared to 2015. Average unit price in 2016 increased net sales by $48.8 million or 2.6% compared to 2015. Also contributing to this increase were higher net sales of components and other products to external customers, which were $1.4 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015. The change in volume includes the incremental impacts of acquisitions and dispositions.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nNet Sales and Percentage of Net Sales by Reportable Segment Table 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>January 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 3, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Residential\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,357,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,197,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Residential intersegment\n</td> <td>(5,926\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,106\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Residential net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>1,351,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,193,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>68.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe\n</td> <td>305,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>312,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe intersegment\n</td> <td>(4,543\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(719\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>301,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>311,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Architectural\n</td> <td>312,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>302,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Architectural intersegment\n</td> <td>(14,353\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Architectural net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>297,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>291,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate & Other net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>23,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,973,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,871,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNorth American Residential\nNet sales to external customers from facilities in the North American Residential segment in the year ended January 1, 2017, were $1,351.3 million, an increase of $158.1 million or 13.3% from $1,193.2 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Net sales in 2016 were negatively impacted by $17.8 million as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $175.9 million or 14.7% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Higher volume in 2016 increased net sales by $160.4 million or 13.4% compared to 2015. Average unit price increased net sales in 2016 by $14.2 million or 1.2% compared to 2015. Also contributing to this increase were higher net sales of components and other products to external customers, which were $1.3 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015.\nEurope\nNet sales to external customers from facilities in the Europe segment in the year ended January 1, 2017, were $301.2 million, a decrease of $10.6 million or 3.4% from $311.8 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Net sales in 2016 were negatively impacted by $28.0 million as a result of foreign exchange fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $17.4 million or 5.6% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Average unit price increased net sales in 2016 by $24.2 million or 7.8% compared to 2015. Partially offsetting this increase were lower volume in 2016, which decreased net sales by $4.8 million or 1.5%, and net sales of components and other products to external customers, which were $2.0 million lower in 2016 compared to 2015. The change in volume includes the incremental impacts of acquisitions and dispositions.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nArchitectural\nNet sales to external customers from facilities in the Architectural segment in the year ended January 1, 2017, were $297.9 million, an increase of $6.1 million or 2.1% from $291.8 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Net sales in 2016 were negatively impacted by $1.3 million as a result of foreign exchange fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $7.4 million or 2.5% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Average unit price increased net sales in 2016 by $10.4 million or 3.6% compared to 2015. Net sales of components and other products to external customers were $2.4 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015. Lower volume decreased net sales in 2016 by $5.4 million or 1.9%.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 79.2% and 81.3% for the year ended January 1, 2017, and January 3, 2016, respectively. The primary reasons for the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales were the favorable impact of average unit price on our net sales, our increased operating leverage and our continued cost control efforts. Material cost of sales, overhead and depreciation as a percentage of net sales in 2016 decreased 1.5%, 0.7%, 0.3%, respectively, over the 2015 period. Direct labor and distribution as a percentage of sales increased by 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively, over the 2015 period.\nSelling, General and Administration Expenses\nIn the year ended January 1, 2017, selling, general and administration expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 13.2% compared to 13.0% in the year ended January 3, 2016, an increase of 20 basis points.\nSelling, general and administration expenses in the year ended January 1, 2017, were $260.4 million, an increase of $16.3 million from $244.1 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. The increase included $6.7 million of non-cash items in SG&A expenses, including share based compensation, depreciation and amortization, deferred compensation and loss on sale of fixed assets. The increase was also driven by an $8.3 million increase in personnel costs due to a combination of wage inflation and investments in additional personnel, a $3.9 million increase in professional fees, primarily related to IT and digital initiatives, a $1.2 million increase in marketing costs, a $0.8 million increase in travel expenses and other increases of $0.8 million. These increases were partially offset by favorable foreign exchange impacts of $5.0 million and a net incremental decrease of $0.4 million due to acquisitions and dispositions.\nRestructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs in the year ended January 1, 2017, were $1.4 million, compared to $5.7 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Restructuring costs in 2016 were related primarily to expenses incurred as part of the 2016 Plan. Costs incurred in 2015 were related primarily to the 2015 Plan.\nAsset Impairment\nAsset impairment charges were $1.5 million in the year ended January 1, 2017, compared to $9.4 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Asset impairment charges in 2016 resulted from restructuring actions associated with the 2016 Plan. Asset impairment charges in 2015 resulted from the sale of Premdor S.A.S., Masonite's door business in France, which was determined to be a triggering event requiring a test of the indefinite-lived trade name assets of the Europe segment. This charge represents the excess of the carrying value over the fair value as determined using the relief of royalty discounted cash flows method.\nLoss (Gain) on Disposal of Subsidiaries\nGain on disposal of subsidiaries was $6.6 million in the year ended January 1, 2017, compared to the loss on disposal of subsidiaries of $60.0 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. The gain in 2016 arose as a result of the sale of our equity interest in MAL and the liquidation of our legal entity in Romania. The gain relating to MAL represents the excess of pre-tax cash received upon closing of the sale over the book value of the investment, and the gain relating to Romania is comprised of the recognition of the cumulative translation adjustment out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The charge in 2015 arose as a result of the deconsolidation of MAL and the disposition of Premdor S.A.S., our door business in France.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net, in the year ended January 1, 2017, was $28.2 million, compared to $32.9 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. This decrease primarily relates to the refinancing of $500.0 million of 8.25% senior unsecured notes for $475.0 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes issued on March 23, 2015.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was zero in the year ended January 1, 2017, compared to $28.0 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. The charge in 2015 represents the difference between the redemption price of our senior unsecured notes due 2021 of $531.7 million and the net carrying amount of such notes of $503.7 million. In addition to the $500.0 million of principal, the redemption price included a make-whole premium of $31.7 million and the net carrying amount included unamortized premiums of $11.5 million, partially offset by unamortized debt issuance costs of $7.8 million.\nOther Expense (Income), Net\nOther expense (income), net, in the year ended January 1, 2017, was $(2.0) million, compared to $(1.8) million in the year ended January 3, 2016. The change in other expense (income), net, is primarily due to unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency remeasurements. Also contributing to the change were our portion of dividends and the net gains and losses related to our non-majority owned unconsolidated subsidiary that are recognized under the equity method of accounting and other miscellaneous non-operating expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nOur income tax expense in the year ended January 1, 2017, was $21.8 million, an increase of $7.6 million from $14.2 million of income tax expense in the year ended January 3, 2016. The increase in income tax expense (benefit) is primarily due to the mix of income or losses within the tax jurisdictions with various tax rates in which we operate and losses in tax jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances.\nSegment Information Table 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nAdjusted EBITDA in our North American Residential segment increased $47.0 million, or 28.4%, to $212.6 million in the year ended January 1, 2017, from $165.6 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA in the North American Residential segment included corporate allocations of shared costs of $50.7 million and $44.7 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The allocations generally consist of certain costs of human resources, legal, finance, information technology, research and development and share based compensation.\nAdjusted EBITDA in our Europe segment increased $8.3 million, or 27.2%, to $38.8 million in the year ended January 1, 2017, from $30.5 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA in the Europe segment included an incremental comparative benefit of $0.1 million from the disposal of France in 2015.\nAdjusted EBITDA in our Architectural segment increased $1.9 million to $25.2 million in the year ended January 1, 2017, from $23.3 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA in the Architectural segment also included corporate allocations of shared costs of $7.8 million and $6.5 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The allocations generally consist of certain costs of human resources, legal, finance and information technology.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity needs for operations vary throughout the year. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, the borrowings under our ABL Facility and accounts receivable sales programs (\"AR Sales Programs\") and our existing cash balance. Our anticipated uses of cash in the near term include working capital needs, capital expenditures and share repurchases. As of December 31, 2017, we do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures. We anticipate capital expenditures in fiscal year 2018 to be approximately $75 million to $80 million. On a continual basis, we evaluate and consider strategic acquisitions, divestitures, and joint ventures to create shareholder value and enhance financial performance.\nWe believe that our cash balance on hand, future cash generated from operations, the use of our AR Sales Programs, our ABL Facility, and ability to access the capital markets will provide adequate liquidity for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2017, we had $176.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, availability under our ABL Facility of $135.9 million and availability under our AR Sales Programs of $26.2 million.\nCash Flows\nYear Ended December 31, 2017, Compared with Year Ended January 1, 2017\nCash provided by operating activities was $173.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, a nominal decrease compared to $174.0 million during the year ended January 1, 2017.\nCash used in investing activities was $89.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $76.5 million cash used during the year ended January 1, 2017. This $13.3 million increase in cash used in investing activities was driven by an increase of $5.2 million in cash used in acquisitions (net of cash acquired), a decrease of $15.1 million of cash proceeds from disposal of subsidiaries and other increases in investing outflows of $1.5 million. These increases to investing cash outflows were partially offset by an $8.5 million decrease in cash additions to property, plant and equipment.\nCash provided in financing activities was $21.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $109.6 million of cash used in financing activities during the year ended January 1, 2017. This $130.8 million net increase in financing inflows was driven by $153.9 million in net cash proceeds from the 2017 issuance of the 2023 Notes and other financing net inflows of $1.4 million. These net inflows were partially offset by a $10.7 million increase in outflows for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in 2017 compared to 2016, a $10.5 million prior year inflow from the exercise of warrants to purchase our common shares and a $3.3 million increase in tax withholding on share based awards.\nYear Ended January 1, 2017, Compared with Year Ended January 3, 2016\nCash provided by operating activities was $174.0 million during the year ended January 1, 2017, compared to $161.0 million during the year ended January 3, 2016. This $13.0 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a $55.6 million increase in our net income (loss) attributable to Masonite, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating items, partially offset by an increase in net working capital in 2016 compared to 2015.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nCash used in investing activities was $76.5 million during the year ended January 1, 2017, compared to $180.2 million cash used during the year ended January 3, 2016. This $103.7 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was driven by a decrease of $108.8 million in cash used in acquisitions (net of cash acquired) and an increase of $27.0 million of cash proceeds from disposal of subsidiaries (net of cash disposed). These decreases to investing cash outflows were partially offset by $31.2 million of higher additions to property, plant and equipment, due to investments to support additional volume, and other increases in investing outflows of $0.9 million.\nCash used in financing activities was $109.6 million during the year ended January 1, 2017, compared to $72.0 million cash used during the year ended January 3, 2016. This $37.6 million increase in financing outflows was driven by $109.2 million of cash outflow for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in 2016, partially offset by $3.0 million of year over year other outflows. These current year cash outflows were offset by $10.5 million of proceeds from the exercise of warrants to purchase our common shares, as well as the prior year net cash use of $64.1 million related to the issuance of the 2023 Notes and repurchase of the 2021 Notes (as described below).\nShare Repurchases\nWe currently have in place a $350 million share repurchase authorization, stemming from two separate authorizations by our Board of Directors. On February 23, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program whereby we may repurchase up to $150 million worth of our outstanding common shares and on February 22, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $200 million (collectively, the share repurchase programs\u201d). The share repurchase programs have no specified end date. While the share repurchase programs may take two years to complete, the timing and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by management based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Any repurchases under the share repurchase programs may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The share repurchase programs do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares, and they may be suspended or terminated at any time at our discretion. Repurchases under the share repurchase programs are permitted to be made under one or more Rule 10b5-1 plans, which would permit shares to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under applicable insider trading laws. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased and retired 1,794,101 of our common shares in the open market at an aggregate cost of $119.9 million as part of the share repurchase programs. During the year ended January 1, 2017, we repurchased 1,668,057 of our common shares in the open market at an aggregate cost of $109.2 million. As of December 31, 2017, $120.9 million was available for repurchase in accordance with the share repurchase programs.\nOther Liquidity Matters\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance includes cash held in foreign countries in which we operate. Cash held outside Canada, in which we are incorporated, is free from significant restrictions that would prevent the cash from being accessed to meet our liquidity needs including, if necessary, to fund operations and service debt obligations in Canada. However, earnings from certain jurisdictions are indefinitely reinvested in those jurisdictions. Upon the repatriation of any earnings to Canada, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to Canadian income taxes and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. As of December 31, 2017, we do not believe adverse tax consequences exist that restrict our use of cash or cash equivalents in a material manner.\nWe also routinely monitor the changes in the financial condition of our customers and the potential impact on our results of operations. There has not been a change in the financial condition of a customer that has had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, if economic conditions were to deteriorate, it is possible that there could be an impact on our results of operations in a future period and this impact could be material.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nAccounts Receivable Sales Programs\nWe maintain an accounts receivable sales program with a third party (the \"AR Sales Program\"). Under the AR Sales Program, we can transfer ownership of eligible trade accounts receivable of certain customers. Receivables are sold outright to a third party who assumes the full risk of collection, without recourse to us in the event of a loss. Transfers of receivables under this program are accounted for as sales. Proceeds from the transfers reflect the face value of the accounts receivable less a discount. Receivables sold under the AR Sales Program are excluded from trade accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets and are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The discounts on the sales of trade accounts receivable sold under the AR Sales Program were not material for any of the periods presented and were recorded in selling, general and administration expense within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nSenior Notes\nOn September 27, 2017, and March 23, 2015, we issued $150.0 million and $475.0 million aggregate principal senior unsecured notes, respectively (the \"2023 Notes\"). The 2023 Notes were issued in two private placements for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and to buyers outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 2023 Notes were issued without registration rights and are not listed on any securities exchange. The 2023 Notes bear interest at 5.625% per annum, payable in cash semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year and are due March 15, 2023. The 2023 Notes were issued at 104.0% and par in 2017 and 2015, respectively, and the resulting premium of $6.0 million is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2023 Notes using the effective interest method. We received net proceeds of $153.9 million and $467.9 million, respectively, after deducting $2.1 million and $7.1 million of debt issuance costs in 2017 and 2015, respectively. The debt issuance costs were capitalized as a reduction to the carrying value of debt and are being accreted to interest expense over the term of the 2023 Notes using the effective interest method. The net proceeds from the 2017 issuance of the 2023 Notes were for general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the 2015 issuance of the 2023 Notes, together with available cash balances, were used to redeem $500.0 million aggregate principal of prior 8.25% senior unsecured notes due 2021 and to pay related premiums, fees and expenses.\nObligations under the 2023 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis, by certain of our directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries. We may redeem the 2023 Notes under certain circumstances specified therein. The indenture governing the 2023 Notes contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and our subsidiaries' ability to: (i) incur additional debt and issue disqualified or preferred stock, (ii) make restricted payments, (iii) sell assets, (iv) create or permit restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us, (v) create or incur certain liens, (vi) enter into sale and leaseback transactions, (vii) merge or consolidate with other entities and (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates. The foregoing limitations are subject to exceptions as set forth in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes. In addition, if in the future the 2023 Notes have an investment grade rating from at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, certain of these covenants will be replaced with a less restrictive covenant. The indenture governing the 2023 Notes contains customary events of default (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods). As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants under the indenture governing the 2023 Notes.\nABL Facility\nOn April 9, 2015, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a $150.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the \"ABL Facility\") maturing on April 9, 2020. The borrowing base is calculated based on a percentage of the value of selected U.S. and Canadian accounts receivable and inventory, less certain ineligible amounts. Obligations under the ABL Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the current assets of Masonite and our subsidiaries. In addition, obligations under the ABL Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis, by certain of our directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries. Borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, (i) the Base Rate, Canadian Prime Rate or Canadian Base Rate (each as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75% per annum, or (ii) the Eurodollar Base Rate or BA Rate (each as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement), plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75% per annum. In addition to paying interest on any outstanding principal under\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nthe ABL Facility a commitment fee is payable on the undrawn portion of the ABL Facility in an amount equal to 0.25% per annum of the average daily balance of unused commitments during each calendar quarter.\nThe ABL Facility contains various customary representations, warranties and covenants by us that, among other things, and subject to certain exceptions, restrict Masonite's ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to: (i) pay dividends on our common shares and make other restricted payments, (ii) make investments and acquisitions, (iii) engage in transactions with our affiliates, (iv) sell assets, (v) merge and (vi) create liens. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amended the ABL Facility to, among other things, (i) permit us to incur unlimited unsecured debt as long as such debt does not contain covenants or default provisions that are more restrictive than those contained in the ABL Facility, (ii) permit us to incur debt as long as the pro forma secured leverage ratio is less than 4.5 to 1.0, and (iii) add certain additional exceptions and exemptions under the restricted payment, investment and indebtedness covenants (including increasing the amount of certain debt permitted to be incurred under an existing exception). As of December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility and there were no amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility.\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nOur obligations under the 2023 Notes and the ABL Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain of our directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries. The following unaudited supplemental financial information for our non-guarantor subsidiaries is presented:\nOur non-guarantor subsidiaries generated external net sales of $1.8 billion in the year ended December 31, 2017 and $1.6 billion in each of the years ended January 1, 2017, and January 3, 2016. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries generated Adjusted EBITDA of $209.2 million, $204.5 million and $166.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, January 1, 2017, and January 3, 2016, respectively. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries had total assets of $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2017; and total liabilities of $693.8 million and $771.2 million as of December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2017, respectively.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents our contractual obligations over the periods indicated as of December 31, 2017: Table 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt maturities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>625,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>625,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Scheduled interest payments\n</td> <td>35,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>23,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension contributions\n</td> <td>5,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>711,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>983,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\n(1) As of December 31, 2017, we have $5.3 million recorded as a long-term liability for uncertain tax positions. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments, or the amount by which our liability for these uncertain tax positions will increase or decrease over time, and accordingly, this liability has been excluded from the above table.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are fully disclosed in our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Acquisition Accounting\nWe use the acquisition method of accounting for all business acquisitions. We allocate the purchase price of our business acquisitions based on the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets. The difference between the total cost of the acquisitions and the sum of the fair values of the acquired tangible and intangible assets less liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate all business combinations for intangible assets that should be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested annually for impairment on the last day of fiscal November, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The test for impairment is performed at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount to its fair value. Possible impairment in goodwill is first analyzed using qualitative factors such as macroeconomic and market conditions, changing costs and actual and projected performance, amongst others, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. If it is determined more likely than not that the book value exceeds fair value, a quantitative analysis is performed to test for impairment. When quantitative steps are determined necessary, the fair values of the reporting units are estimated through the use of discounted cash flow analyses and market multiples. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, then goodwill is impaired. Any impairment in goodwill is measured by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation and comparing the notional goodwill from the fair value allocation to the carrying value of the goodwill. We performed a quantitative impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2017 and determined that goodwill was not impaired.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets with definite lives include customer relationships, non-compete agreements, patents, supply agreements, certain acquired trademarks and system software development. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be greater than the fair value. An impairment loss is recognized when the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows generated by such assets is less than the carrying amount. Measurement of the impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset, determined using discounted cash flows when quoted market prices are not readily available. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually on the last day of fiscal November, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicated that the carrying value may exceed the fair value. The inputs utilized to derive projected cash flows are subject to significant judgments and uncertainties. As such, the realized cash flows could differ significantly from those estimated. We performed a quantitative impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2017 and determined that indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired.\nLong-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the estimates of asset's useful lives and undiscounted future cash flows based on market participant assumptions. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset and the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with inherent uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. We assess the income tax positions and record tax liabilities for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available as of the reporting date.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at enacted rates. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be a credit to income in the period such determination was made. The consolidated financial statements include increases in the valuation allowances as a result of uncertainty regarding our ability to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future.\nOur accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates. Changes in existing tax laws, regulations, rates and future operating results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are also subject to change as a result in changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings.\nAlthough we believe the measurement of liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcomes of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. If we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary, the liability is reversed and a tax benefit is recognized in the period in which such determination is made. Conversely, additional tax charges are recorded in a period in which it is determined that a recorded tax liability is less than the ultimate assessment is expected to be. If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, there could be a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nInventory\nWe value inventories at the lower of cost or replacement cost for raw materials, and the lower of cost or net realizable value for finished goods, with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory. In determining net realizable value, we consider such factors as yield, turnover and aging, expected future demand and market conditions, as well as past experience. A change in the underlying assumptions related to these factors could affect the valuation of inventory and have a corresponding effect on cost of goods sold. Historically, actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates.\nShare Based Compensation Plan\nWe have a share based compensation plan, which governs the issuance of common shares to employees as compensation through various grants of share instruments. We apply the fair value method of accounting using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the compensation expense for stock appreciation rights. The compensation expense for the Restricted Stock Units awarded is based on the fair value of the restricted stock units at the date of grant. Additionally, the compensation expense for certain performance based awards is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Compensation expense is recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and is recognized over the requisite service period. The determination of obligations and compensation expense requires the use of several mathematical and judgmental factors, including stock price, expected volatility, the anticipated life of the award, estimated risk free rate and the number of shares or share options expected to vest. Any difference in the number of shares or share options that actually vest can affect future compensation expense. Other assumptions are not revised after the original estimate.\nVariable Interest Entity\nThe accounting method used for our investments is dependent upon the influence we have over the investee. We consolidate subsidiaries when we are able to exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally occurs if we own a 50% or greater voting interest.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nPursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation\u201d, for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests ( variable interest entities\u201d or VIEs\u201d), an investee may be consolidated if we are considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that has the power to direct the activities of the VIE which most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and that has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE which could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nSignificant judgment is required in the determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Estimates and assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, the market price of input costs, the market price for finished products, market demand conditions within various regions and the probability of certain other outcomes.\nChanges in Accounting Standards and Policies\nChanges in accounting standards and policies are discussed in Note 1.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is based upon accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and discusses the financial condition and results of operations for Masonite International Corporation for the years ended December 31, 2017, January 1, 2017, and January 3, 2016. In this MD&A, \"Masonite,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" and the \"Company\" refer to Masonite International Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the disclosure under \"Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\" and Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\", elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties.\nOverview\nWe are a leading global designer, manufacturer and distributor of interior and exterior doors for the new construction and repair, renovation and remodeling sectors of the residential and non-residential building construction markets. Since 1925, we have provided our customers with innovative products and superior service at compelling values. In order to better serve our customers and create sustainable competitive advantages, we focus on developing innovative products, advanced manufacturing capabilities and technology-driven sales and service solutions.\nWe market and sell our products to remodeling contractors, builders, homeowners, retailers, dealers, lumberyards, commercial and general contractors and architects through well-established wholesale, retail and direct distribution channels as part of our cross-merchandising strategy. Customers are provided a broad product offering of interior and exterior doors and entry systems at various price points. We manufacture a broad line of interior doors, including residential molded, flush, stile and rail, louver and specially-ordered commercial and architectural doors; door components for internal use and sale to other door manufacturers; and exterior residential steel, fiberglass and wood doors and entry systems.\nWe operate 64 manufacturing and distribution facilities in 8 countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, which are strategically located to serve our customers through multiple distribution channels. These distribution channels include: (i) direct distribution to retail home center customers; (ii) one-step distribution that sells directly to homebuilders and contractors; and (iii) two-step distribution through wholesale distributors. For retail home center customers, numerous door fabrication facilities provide value-added fabrication and logistical services, including pre-finishing and store delivery of pre-hung interior and exterior doors. We believe our ability to provide: (i) a broad product range; (ii) frequent, rapid, on-time and complete delivery; (iii) consistency in products and merchandising; (iv) national service; and (v) special order programs enables retail customers to increase comparable store sales and helps to differentiate us from our competitors. We believe investments in innovative new product manufacturing and distribution capabilities, coupled with an ongoing commitment to operational excellence, provide a strong platform for future growth.\nOur reportable segments are currently organized and managed principally by end market: North American Residential, Europe and Architectural. In the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated net sales of $1,428.9 million or 70.3%, $291.9 million or 14.4% and $288.5 million or 14.2% in our North American Residential, Europe and Architectural segments, respectively. See \"Components of Results of Operations - Segment Information\" below for a description of our reportable segments.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nProduct Demand\nThere are numerous factors that influence overall market demand for our products. Demand for new homes, home improvement products and other building construction products have a direct impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Demand for our products may be impacted by changes in United States, Canadian, European, Asian or other global economic conditions, including inflation, deflation, interest rates, availability of capital, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs, and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Additionally, trends in residential new construction, repair, renovation and remodeling and architectural building\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nconstruction may directly impact our financial performance. Accordingly, the following factors may have a direct impact on our business in the countries and regions in which our products are sold:\n \u2022 the strength of the economy; \n \u2022 the amount and type of residential and commercial construction; \n \u2022 housing sales and home values; \n \u2022 the age of existing home stock, home vacancy rates and foreclosures; \n \u2022 non-residential building occupancy rates; \n \u2022 increases in the cost of raw materials or wages or any shortage in supplies or labor; \n \u2022 the availability and cost of credit; \n \u2022 employment rates and consumer confidence; and \n \u2022 demographic factors such as immigration and migration of the population and trends in household formation.  Additionally, the United Kingdom's formal trigger of the two year process for its exit from the European Union, and related negotiations, has created uncertainty in European demand, particularly in the United Kingdom, which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products in the foreseeable future.\nProduct Pricing and Mix\nThe building products industry is highly competitive and we therefore face pressure on sales prices of our products. In addition, our competitors may adopt more aggressive sales policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do, which could result in a loss of customers. Our business in general is subject to changing consumer and industry trends, demands and preferences. Trends within the industry change often and our failure to anticipate, identify or quickly react to changes in these trends could lead to, among other things, rejection of a new product line and reduced demand and price reductions for our products, which could materially adversely affect us. Changes in consumer preferences may also lead to increased demand for our lower margin products relative to our higher margin products, which could reduce our future profitability.\nBusiness Wins and Losses\nOur customers consist mainly of wholesalers and retail home centers. In fiscal year 2017, our top ten customers together accounted for approximately 44% of our net sales and our top customer, The Home Depot, Inc. accounted for approximately 18% of our net sales in fiscal year 2017. Net sales from customers that have accounted for a significant portion of our net sales in past periods, individually or as a group, may not continue in future periods, or if continued, may not reach or exceed historical levels in any period. Certain customers perform periodic product line reviews to assess their product offerings, which have, on past occasions, led to business wins and losses. In addition, as a result of competitive bidding processes, we may not be able to increase or maintain the margins at which we sell our products to our customers.\nOrganizational Restructuring\nOver the past several years we have initiated, and in the future we may initiate, restructuring plans designed to eliminate excess capacity in order to align our manufacturing capabilities with reductions in demand, as well as to streamline our organizational structure and reposition our business for improved long-term profitability.\nDuring 2016, we began implementing a plan (the \"2016 Plan\") to close one manufacturing facility in the Architectural segment, which included the reduction of approximately 140 positions. The 2016 Plan was implemented to improve our cost structure and enhance operational efficiencies. Costs associated with the 2016 Plan include closure costs and severance and the 2016 Plan is substantially completed. As of December 31, 2017, we do not expect to incur any future charges relating to the 2016 Plan. The actions taken as part of the 2016 Plan are expected to increase our annual earnings and cash flows by approximately $4 million.\nDuring 2015, we began implementing a multi-year plan to reorganize and consolidate certain aspects of our global head office (the \"2015 Plan\"). The 2015 Plan includes the creation of a new shared services function and the rationalization of certain of our European facilities, including related headcount reductions. The 2015 Plan was implemented in response to the need for more effective business processes enabled by the planned implementation of our\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nnew enterprise resource planning system in our architectural business as well as ongoing weak market conditions in Africa and Europe outside of the United Kingdom. Costs associated with the 2015 Plan included severance and closure charges and are substantially completed. As of December 31, 2017, we do not expect to incur any material future charges for the 2015 Plan. Once fully implemented, the actions taken as part of the 2015 Plan are estimated to increase our annual earnings and cash flows by approximately $6 million.\nForeign Exchange Rate Fluctuation\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuating exchange rates. In the years ended December 31, 2017, January 1, 2017, and January 3, 2016 approximately 34%, 35% and 36% of our net sales were generated outside of the United States, respectively. In addition, a significant percentage of our costs during the same period were not denominated in U.S. dollars. For example, for most of our manufacturing and distribution facilities, the prices for a significant portion of our raw materials are quoted in the domestic currency of the country where the facility is located or other currencies that are not U.S. dollars. We also have substantial assets outside the United States. As a result, the volatility in the price of the U.S. dollar has exposed, and in the future may continue to expose, us to currency exchange risks. Also, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on many aspects of our financial results. Changes in currency exchange rates for any country in which we operate may require us to raise the prices of our products in that country or allow our competitors to sell their products at lower prices in that country. Unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of the financial statements of our non-U.S. functional currency operations are accumulated in the cumulative translation adjustments account in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Net gains from currency translation adjustments as a result of translating our foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars during the year ended December 31, 2017, were $39.0 million, which were primarily driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the other major currencies in which we transact.\nInflation\nAn increase in inflation could have a significant impact on the cost of our raw material inputs. Wage inflation, increased prices for raw materials or finished goods used in our products and/or interruptions in deliveries of raw materials or finished goods could adversely affect our profitability, margins and net sales, particularly if we are not able to pass these incurred costs on to our customers. In addition, interest rates normally increase during periods of rising inflation. Historically, as interest rates increase, demand for new homes and home improvement products decreases. An environment of gradual interest rate increases may, however, signify an improving economy or increasing real estate values, which in turn may stimulate increased home buying activity.\nSeasonality\nOur business is moderately seasonal and our net sales vary from quarter to quarter based upon the timing of the building season in our markets. Severe weather conditions in any quarter, such as unusually prolonged warm or cold conditions, rain, blizzards or hurricanes, could accelerate, delay or halt construction and renovation activity.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nWe are pursuing a strategic initiative of optimizing our global business portfolio. As part of this strategy, in the last several years we have pursued strategic acquisitions targeting companies who produce components for our existing operations, manufacture niche products and provide value-added services. Additionally, we target companies with strong brands, complementary technologies, attractive geographic footprints and opportunities for cost and distribution synergies. We also continuously analyze our operations to determine which businesses, market channels and products create the most value for our customers and acceptable returns for our shareholders.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nAcquisitions\n \u2022 DW3: On January 29, 2018, we completed the acquisition of DW3 Products Holdings Limited ( DW3\u201d), a leading UK provider of high quality premium door solutions and window systems, supplying products under brand names such as Solidor, Residor, Nicedor and Residence. We acquired 100% of the equity interests in DW3 for consideration of approximately $96 million, net of cash acquired.

PDS is based in Lancashire, United Kingdom, and is a producer of high quality niche product lines that complement our existing United Kingdom business.  Dispositions\n \u2022 South Africa: On December 22, 2015, following a comprehensive assessment of Masonite (Africa) Limited ( MAL\u201d), our South African subsidiary, the MAL Board of Directors approved a plan to enter into Business Rescue proceedings, the South African equivalent of bankruptcy proceedings in the United States, similar to a Chapter 11 reorganization. As a result of this plan, a Business Rescue Practitioner was appointed to manage the affairs of the business and we no longer maintained operational control over MAL. For this reason, we deconsolidated MAL effective December 22, 2015.  Subsequent to deconsolidation, we used the cost method to account for our equity investment in MAL, which was reflected as $10.0 million in our consolidated balance sheets as of January 1, 2017, based on the estimated fair value of our portion of MAL's net assets on the date of deconsolidation. During September 2016, we received $15.1 million as final pre-tax proceeds from the sale of our equity interest in MAL. Upon receipt of these proceeds, our equity interest in MAL was eliminated and we accordingly reduced the value of our cost investment in MAL to zero and recorded a gain on disposal of subsidiaries of $5.1 million.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\n \u2022 France: On July 31, 2015, we completed the sale of all of the capital stock of Premdor, S.A.S., Masonite's door business in France, to a Paris-based independent investment firm (the \"Buyer\"). Pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated July 16, 2015, the Buyer acquired all of Masonite's door manufacturing and distribution business in France for nominal consideration. \nComponents of Results of Operations\nNet Sales\nNet sales are derived from the sale of products to our customers. We recognize sales of our products when an agreement with the customer in the form of a sales order is in place, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collection is reasonably assured and the customer has taken ownership and assumes risk of loss. Certain customers are eligible to participate in various incentive and rebate programs considered as a reduction of the sales price of our products. Accordingly, net sales are reported net of such incentives and rebates. Additionally, shipping and other transportation costs charged to customers are recorded in net sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nCost of Goods Sold\nOur cost of goods sold is comprised of the cost to manufacture products for our customers and includes the cost of materials, direct labor, overhead, distribution and depreciation associated with assets used to manufacture products. Research and development costs are primarily included within cost of goods sold. We incur significant fixed and variable overhead at our global component locations that manufacture interior molded door facings. Our overall average production capacity utilization at these locations was approximately 77%, 77%, and 68% for the years ended December 31, 2017, January 1, 2017, and January 3, 2016.\nSelling, General and Administration Expenses\nSelling, general and administration expenses primarily include the costs for our sales organization and support staff at various plants and corporate offices. These costs include personnel costs for payroll, related benefits and stock based compensation expense; professional fees including legal, accounting and consulting fees; depreciation and amortization of our non-manufacturing equipment and assets; travel and entertainment expenses; director, officer and other insurance policies; environmental, health and safety costs; advertising expenses and rent and utilities related to administrative office facilities. Certain charges that are also incurred less frequently and are included in selling, general and administration costs include gain or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment and bad debt expense.\nRestructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs include all salary-related severance benefits that are accrued and expensed when a restructuring plan has been put into place, the plan has received approval from the appropriate level of management and the benefit is probable and reasonably estimable. In addition to salary-related costs, we incur other restructuring costs when facilities are closed or capacity is realigned within the organization. Upon termination of a contract we record liabilities and expenses pursuant to the terms of the relevant agreement. For non-contractual restructuring activities, liabilities and expenses are measured and recorded at fair value in the period in which they are incurred.\nAsset Impairment\nAsset impairment includes charges that are taken when impairment testing indicates that the carrying values of our long-lived assets or asset groups exceed their respective fair values. Definite-lived assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are tested annually for impairment on the last day of fiscal November, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of the asset or asset group being tested exceeds its fair value, except in the case of goodwill, which is tested based on the fair value of the reporting unit where the goodwill is recorded.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nLoss (Gain) on Disposal of Subsidiaries\nLoss (gain) on disposal of subsidiaries represents the difference between proceeds received upon disposition and the book value of a subsidiary which has been divested and was excluded from treatment as a discontinued operation. Also included in loss (gain) on disposal of subsidiaries is recognition of the cumulative translation adjustment out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net relates primarily to our consolidated senior unsecured indebtedness. Subsequent to March 23, 2015, interest expense, net relates to our $625.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2023 (the \"2023 Notes\"). Prior to March 23, 2015, interest expense related to our $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2021, which were redeemed on March 23, 2015, concurrent with the issuance of the 2023 Notes. Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the 2023 Notes were capitalized as a reduction to the carrying value of debt and are being accreted to interest expense over their respective terms. The most recent issuance of our 2023 Notes resulted in a premium that is amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2023 Notes. Additionally, we pay interest on any outstanding principal under our ABL Facility and we are required to pay a commitment fee for unutilized commitments under the ABL Facility, both of which are recorded in interest expense as incurred.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt represents the difference between the reacquisition price of debt and the net carrying amount of the extinguished debt. The net carrying amount includes the principal, unamortized premium and unamortized debt issuance costs.\nOther Expense (Income), Net\nOther expense (income), net includes profits and losses related to our non-majority owned unconsolidated subsidiaries that we recognize under the equity method of accounting, unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency remeasurements, pension settlement charges and other miscellaneous non-operating expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the deferred tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is anticipated to be realized on a more likely than not basis. Our combined effective income tax rate is primarily the weighted average of federal, state and provincial rates in various countries where we have operations, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Our income tax rate is also affected by estimates of our ability to realize tax assets and changes in tax laws.\nOn December 22, 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Reform\"). Among other items, Tax Reform reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. This has caused our net deferred tax liabilities in the U.S. to be revalued.\nSegment Information\nOur reportable segments are organized and managed principally by end market: North American Residential, Europe and Architectural. The North American Residential reportable segment is the aggregation of the Wholesale and Retail operating segments. The Europe reportable segment is the aggregation of the United Kingdom, Central Eastern Europe and France (prior to disposal) operating segments. The Architectural reportable segment consists solely of the Architectural operating segment. The Corporate & Other category includes unallocated corporate costs and the results of immaterial operating segments which were not aggregated into any reportable segment, including the historical results of our Africa operating segment (prior to deconsolidation). Operating segments are aggregated into reportable segments only if they exhibit similar economic characteristics. In addition to similar economic characteristics we also consider the\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nfollowing factors in determining the reportable segments: the nature of business activities, the management structure directly accountable to our chief operating decision maker for operating and administrative activities, availability of discrete financial information and information presented to the Board of Directors and investors.\nOur management reviews net sales and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Net assets are not allocated to the reportable segments. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which does not have a standardized meaning under GAAP and is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to either net income or operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Masonite adjusted to exclude the following items:\n \u2022 depreciation; \n \u2022 amortization; \n \u2022 share based compensation expense; \n \u2022 loss (gain) on disposal of property, plant and equipment; \n \u2022 registration and listing fees; \n \u2022 restructuring costs; \n \u2022 asset impairment; \n \u2022 loss (gain) on disposal of subsidiaries; \n \u2022 interest expense (income), net; \n \u2022 loss on extinguishment of debt; \n \u2022 other expense (income), net; \n \u2022 income tax expense (benefit); \n \u2022 loss (income) from discontinued operations, net of tax; and \n \u2022 net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest.  This definition of Adjusted EBITDA differs from the definitions of EBITDA contained in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes and the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility. Adjusted EBITDA is used to evaluate and compare the performance of the segments and it is one of the primary measures used to determine employee incentive compensation. Intersegment transfers are negotiated on an arm's length basis, using market prices.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA, from an operations standpoint, provides an appropriate way to measure and assess segment performance. Our management team has established the practice of reviewing the performance of each segment based on the measures of net sales and Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to users of the consolidated financial statements because it provides the same information that we use internally to evaluate and compare the performance of the segments and it is one of the primary measures used to determine employee incentive compensation.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nResults of Operations \nYear Ended December 31, 2017, Compared with Year Ended January 1, 2017\nNet Sales\nNet sales in the year ended December 31, 2017, were $2,032.9 million, an increase of $58.9 million or 3.0% from $1,974.0 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Net sales in 2017 were negatively impacted by $6.6 million as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $65.5 million or 3.3% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Average unit price in 2017 increased net sales by $47.4 million or 2.4% compared to 2016. Higher volume in 2017 increased net sales by $21.9 million or 1.1% compared to 2016. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased net sales of components and other products to external customers, which were $3.8 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016. The change in volume includes the incremental impacts of acquisitions and dispositions.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nNet Sales and Percentage of Net Sales by Reportable Segment \nNorth American Residential\nNet sales to external customers from facilities in the North American Residential segment in the year ended December 31, 2017, were $1,428.9 million, an increase of $77.6 million or 5.7% from $1,351.3 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Net sales in 2017 were positively impacted by $5.0 million as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $72.6 million or 5.4% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Higher volume in 2017 increased net sales by $44.0 million or 3.3% compared to 2016. Average unit price increased net sales in 2017 by $30.5 million or 2.3% compared to 2016. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased net sales of components and other products to external customers, which were $1.9 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016.\nEurope\nNet sales to external customers from facilities in the Europe segment in the year ended December 31, 2017, were $291.9 million, a decrease of $9.3 million or 3.1% from $301.2 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Net sales in 2017 were negatively impacted by $12.1 million as a result of foreign exchange fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $2.8 million or 0.9% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Average unit price increased net sales in 2017 by $5.6 million or 1.9% compared to 2016. Higher volume in 2017 increased net sales by $0.3 million or 0.1% compared to 2016. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased net sales of components and other products to external customers, which were $3.1 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016.\nArchitectural\nNet sales to external customers from facilities in the Architectural segment in the year ended December 31, 2017, were $288.5 million, a decrease of $9.4 million or 3.2% from $297.9 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Net sales in 2017 were positively impacted by $0.6 million as a result of foreign exchange fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have decreased by $10.0 million or 3.4% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Lower volume decreased net sales in 2017 by $23.2 million or 7.8%\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\ncompared to 2016. Partially offsetting this decrease, average unit price increased net sales in 2017 by $11.3 million or 3.8% compared to 2016. Net sales of components and other products to external customers were $1.9 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016. The change in volume includes the incremental impact of acquisitions and dispositions.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 80.0% and 79.2% for the years ended December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2017, respectively. Distribution, overhead and direct labor as a percentage of sales increased by 0.9%, 0.6% and 0.2%, respectively, over the 2016 period. The distribution increase was due to inflationary pressures, shipping inefficiencies related to maintaining customer service levels and costs to complete the ramp-up of new retail business. The overhead and direct labor increases were driven by operational inefficiencies and wage inflation, partly offset by headcount reductions. Material cost of sales and depreciation as a percentage of net sales in 2017 decreased 0.8% and 0.1%, respectively, over the 2016 period. The decrease in material cost of sales was driven by favorable average unit prices partially offset by a combination of inflation and inbound freight increases.\nSelling, General and Administration Expenses\nIn the year ended December 31, 2017, selling, general and administration expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 12.1% compared to 13.2% in the year ended January 1, 2017, a decrease of 110 basis points.\nSelling, general and administration expenses in the year ended December 31, 2017, were $246.9 million, a decrease of $13.5 million from $260.4 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. The decrease included a $6.3 million reduction of non-cash items in SG&A expenses, including share based compensation, depreciation and amortization, deferred compensation and loss on sale of fixed assets. The overall decrease was also driven by a $12.2 million decrease in personnel costs, primarily due to a reduction in our incentive pay accrual, and favorable foreign exchange impacts of $1.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by a $3.6 million increase in marketing costs relating to our re-branding, a net incremental increase of $0.5 million due to acquisitions and other increases of $2.3 million.\nRestructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs in the year ended December 31, 2017, were $0.9 million, compared to $1.4 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Restructuring costs in 2017 related to the final severance and closure costs for the 2016 plan, partly offset by the receipt of $1.1 million as final settlement in the Stay of Proceedings in Israel as part of the 2014 Plan and other reductions to the 2014 Plan accrual. Restructuring costs in 2016 primarily related to the severance costs incurred during the implementation of the 2016 Plan.\nAsset Impairment\nAsset impairment charges were $1.5 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. There were no asset impairment charges in the year ended December 31, 2017. Asset impairment charges in 2016 resulted from restructuring actions associated with the 2016 Plan.\nLoss (Gain) on Disposal of Subsidiaries\nLoss on disposal of subsidiaries was $0.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the gain on disposal of subsidiaries of $6.6 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. The current year loss arose as a result of the liquidation of our legal entity in Hungary. The gain in 2016 arose as a result of the sale of our equity interest in MAL and the liquidation of our legal entity in Romania. The current year loss and the prior year gain related to Hungary and Romania are comprised of the recognition of the cumulative translation adjustment out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The prior year gain relating to MAL represents the excess of pre-tax cash received upon closing of the sale over the book value of the investment.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net, in the year ended December 31, 2017, was $30.2 million, compared to $28.2 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. This increase primarily relates to the issuance of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional 2023 Senior Notes on September 27, 2017.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nOther Expense (Income), Net\nOther expense (income), net, in the year ended December 31, 2017, was $(1.1) million, compared to $(2.0) million in the year ended January 1, 2017. The change in other expense (income), net, is primarily due to unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency remeasurements. Also contributing to the change were our portion of dividends and the net gains and losses related to our non-majority owned unconsolidated subsidiaries that are recognized under the equity method of accounting and other miscellaneous non-operating expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nOur income tax (benefit) in the year ended December 31, 2017, was $(27.6) million, a change of $49.3 million from $21.8 million of income tax expense in the year ended January 1, 2017. The increase in income tax benefit is primarily attributable to recognition of $24.1 million of deferred tax assets in Canada through reversal of valuation allowances, a $27.2 million increase in income tax benefit associated with the change in enacted tax rate applied to existing U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities due to U.S. Tax Reform, the mix of income or losses within the tax jurisdictions with various tax rates in which we operate and losses in tax jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances as of December 31, 2017.\nSegment Information \n\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nThe following reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to Masonite: \n\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nAdjusted EBITDA in our North American Residential segment decreased $12.4 million, or 5.8%, to $200.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, from $212.6 million in the year ended January 1, 2017.

In a 52-week year, each fiscal quarter consists of 13 weeks. For ease of disclosure, the 13-week periods are referred to as three-month periods and the 52- or 53-week periods are referred to as years. Our 2015 fiscal year, which ended on January 3, 2016, contained 53 weeks of operating results, with the additional week occurring in the fourth quarter.\nNet Sales\nNet sales in the year ended January 1, 2017, were $1,974.0 million, an increase of $102.0 million or 5.4% from $1,872.0 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Net sales in 2016 were negatively impacted by $47.4 million as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $149.4 million or 8.0% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Higher volume in 2016 increased net sales by $99.2 million or 5.3% compared to 2015. Average unit price in 2016 increased net sales by $48.8 million or 2.6% compared to 2015. Also contributing to this increase were higher net sales of components and other products to external customers, which were $1.4 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015. The change in volume includes the incremental impacts of acquisitions and dispositions.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nNet Sales and Percentage of Net Sales by Reportable Segment \nNorth American Residential\nNet sales to external customers from facilities in the North American Residential segment in the year ended January 1, 2017, were $1,351.3 million, an increase of $158.1 million or 13.3% from $1,193.2 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Net sales in 2016 were negatively impacted by $17.8 million as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $175.9 million or 14.7% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Higher volume in 2016 increased net sales by $160.4 million or 13.4% compared to 2015. Average unit price increased net sales in 2016 by $14.2 million or 1.2% compared to 2015. Also contributing to this increase were higher net sales of components and other products to external customers, which were $1.3 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015.\nEurope\nNet sales to external customers from facilities in the Europe segment in the year ended January 1, 2017, were $301.2 million, a decrease of $10.6 million or 3.4% from $311.8 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Net sales in 2016 were negatively impacted by $28.0 million as a result of foreign exchange fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $17.4 million or 5.6% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Average unit price increased net sales in 2016 by $24.2 million or 7.8% compared to 2015. Partially offsetting this increase were lower volume in 2016, which decreased net sales by $4.8 million or 1.5%, and net sales of components and other products to external customers, which were $2.0 million lower in 2016 compared to 2015. The change in volume includes the incremental impacts of acquisitions and dispositions.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nArchitectural\nNet sales to external customers from facilities in the Architectural segment in the year ended January 1, 2017, were $297.9 million, an increase of $6.1 million or 2.1% from $291.8 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Net sales in 2016 were negatively impacted by $1.3 million as a result of foreign exchange fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $7.4 million or 2.5% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Average unit price increased net sales in 2016 by $10.4 million or 3.6% compared to 2015. Net sales of components and other products to external customers were $2.4 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015. Lower volume decreased net sales in 2016 by $5.4 million or 1.9%.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 79.2% and 81.3% for the year ended January 1, 2017, and January 3, 2016, respectively. The primary reasons for the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales were the favorable impact of average unit price on our net sales, our increased operating leverage and our continued cost control efforts. Material cost of sales, overhead and depreciation as a percentage of net sales in 2016 decreased 1.5%, 0.7%, 0.3%, respectively, over the 2015 period. Direct labor and distribution as a percentage of sales increased by 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively, over the 2015 period.\nSelling, General and Administration Expenses\nIn the year ended January 1, 2017, selling, general and administration expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 13.2% compared to 13.0% in the year ended January 3, 2016, an increase of 20 basis points.\nSelling, general and administration expenses in the year ended January 1, 2017, were $260.4 million, an increase of $16.3 million from $244.1 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. The increase included $6.7 million of non-cash items in SG&A expenses, including share based compensation, depreciation and amortization, deferred compensation and loss on sale of fixed assets. The increase was also driven by an $8.3 million increase in personnel costs due to a combination of wage inflation and investments in additional personnel, a $3.9 million increase in professional fees, primarily related to IT and digital initiatives, a $1.2 million increase in marketing costs, a $0.8 million increase in travel expenses and other increases of $0.8 million. These increases were partially offset by favorable foreign exchange impacts of $5.0 million and a net incremental decrease of $0.4 million due to acquisitions and dispositions.\nRestructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs in the year ended January 1, 2017, were $1.4 million, compared to $5.7 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Restructuring costs in 2016 were related primarily to expenses incurred as part of the 2016 Plan. Costs incurred in 2015 were related primarily to the 2015 Plan.\nAsset Impairment\nAsset impairment charges were $1.5 million in the year ended January 1, 2017, compared to $9.4 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Asset impairment charges in 2016 resulted from restructuring actions associated with the 2016 Plan. Asset impairment charges in 2015 resulted from the sale of Premdor S.A.S., Masonite's door business in France, which was determined to be a triggering event requiring a test of the indefinite-lived trade name assets of the Europe segment. This charge represents the excess of the carrying value over the fair value as determined using the relief of royalty discounted cash flows method.\nLoss (Gain) on Disposal of Subsidiaries\nGain on disposal of subsidiaries was $6.6 million in the year ended January 1, 2017, compared to the loss on disposal of subsidiaries of $60.0 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. The gain in 2016 arose as a result of the sale of our equity interest in MAL and the liquidation of our legal entity in Romania. The gain relating to MAL represents the excess of pre-tax cash received upon closing of the sale over the book value of the investment, and the gain relating to Romania is comprised of the recognition of the cumulative translation adjustment out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The charge in 2015 arose as a result of the deconsolidation of MAL and the disposition of Premdor S.A.S., our door business in France.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net, in the year ended January 1, 2017, was $28.2 million, compared to $32.9 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. This decrease primarily relates to the refinancing of $500.0 million of 8.25% senior unsecured notes for $475.0 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes issued on March 23, 2015.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was zero in the year ended January 1, 2017, compared to $28.0 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. The charge in 2015 represents the difference between the redemption price of our senior unsecured notes due 2021 of $531.7 million and the net carrying amount of such notes of $503.7 million. In addition to the $500.0 million of principal, the redemption price included a make-whole premium of $31.7 million and the net carrying amount included unamortized premiums of $11.5 million, partially offset by unamortized debt issuance costs of $7.8 million.\nOther Expense (Income), Net\nOther expense (income), net, in the year ended January 1, 2017, was $(2.0) million, compared to $(1.8) million in the year ended January 3, 2016. The change in other expense (income), net, is primarily due to unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency remeasurements. Also contributing to the change were our portion of dividends and the net gains and losses related to our non-majority owned unconsolidated subsidiary that are recognized under the equity method of accounting and other miscellaneous non-operating expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nOur income tax expense in the year ended January 1, 2017, was $21.8 million, an increase of $7.6 million from $14.2 million of income tax expense in the year ended January 3, 2016. The increase in income tax expense (benefit) is primarily due to the mix of income or losses within the tax jurisdictions with various tax rates in which we operate and losses in tax jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances.\nSegment Information \n\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nThe following reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to Masonite: \n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is based upon accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and discusses the financial condition and results of operations for Masonite International Corporation for the years ended December 31, 2017, January 1, 2017, and January 3, 2016. In this MD&A, \"Masonite,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" and the \"Company\" refer to Masonite International Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the disclosure under \"Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\" and Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\", elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties.\nOverview\nWe are a leading global designer, manufacturer and distributor of interior and exterior doors for the new construction and repair, renovation and remodeling sectors of the residential and non-residential building construction markets. Since 1925, we have provided our customers with innovative products and superior service at compelling values. In order to better serve our customers and create sustainable competitive advantages, we focus on developing innovative products, advanced manufacturing capabilities and technology-driven sales and service solutions.\nWe market and sell our products to remodeling contractors, builders, homeowners, retailers, dealers, lumberyards, commercial and general contractors and architects through well-established wholesale, retail and direct distribution channels as part of our cross-merchandising strategy. Customers are provided a broad product offering of interior and exterior doors and entry systems at various price points. We manufacture a broad line of interior doors, including residential molded, flush, stile and rail, louver and specially-ordered commercial and architectural doors; door components for internal use and sale to other door manufacturers; and exterior residential steel, fiberglass and wood doors and entry systems.\nWe operate 64 manufacturing and distribution facilities in 8 countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, which are strategically located to serve our customers through multiple distribution channels. These distribution channels include: (i) direct distribution to retail home center customers; (ii) one-step distribution that sells directly to homebuilders and contractors; and (iii) two-step distribution through wholesale distributors. For retail home center customers, numerous door fabrication facilities provide value-added fabrication and logistical services, including pre-finishing and store delivery of pre-hung interior and exterior doors. We believe our ability to provide: (i) a broad product range; (ii) frequent, rapid, on-time and complete delivery; (iii) consistency in products and merchandising; (iv) national service; and (v) special order programs enables retail customers to increase comparable store sales and helps to differentiate us from our competitors. We believe investments in innovative new product manufacturing and distribution capabilities, coupled with an ongoing commitment to operational excellence, provide a strong platform for future growth.\nOur reportable segments are currently organized and managed principally by end market: North American Residential, Europe and Architectural. In the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated net sales of $1,428.9 million or 70.3%, $291.9 million or 14.4% and $288.5 million or 14.2% in our North American Residential, Europe and Architectural segments, respectively. See \"Components of Results of Operations - Segment Information\" below for a description of our reportable segments.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nProduct Demand\nThere are numerous factors that influence overall market demand for our products. Demand for new homes, home improvement products and other building construction products have a direct impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Demand for our products may be impacted by changes in United States, Canadian, European, Asian or other global economic conditions, including inflation, deflation, interest rates, availability of capital, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs, and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Additionally, trends in residential new construction, repair, renovation and remodeling and architectural building\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nconstruction may directly impact our financial performance. Accordingly, the following factors may have a direct impact on our business in the countries and regions in which our products are sold:\n \u2022 the strength of the economy; \n \u2022 the amount and type of residential and commercial construction; \n \u2022 housing sales and home values; \n \u2022 the age of existing home stock, home vacancy rates and foreclosures; \n \u2022 non-residential building occupancy rates; \n \u2022 increases in the cost of raw materials or wages or any shortage in supplies or labor; \n \u2022 the availability and cost of credit; \n \u2022 employment rates and consumer confidence; and \n \u2022 demographic factors such as immigration and migration of the population and trends in household formation.  Additionally, the United Kingdom's formal trigger of the two year process for its exit from the European Union, and related negotiations, has created uncertainty in European demand, particularly in the United Kingdom, which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products in the foreseeable future.\nProduct Pricing and Mix\nThe building products industry is highly competitive and we therefore face pressure on sales prices of our products. In addition, our competitors may adopt more aggressive sales policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do, which could result in a loss of customers. Our business in general is subject to changing consumer and industry trends, demands and preferences. Trends within the industry change often and our failure to anticipate, identify or quickly react to changes in these trends could lead to, among other things, rejection of a new product line and reduced demand and price reductions for our products, which could materially adversely affect us. Changes in consumer preferences may also lead to increased demand for our lower margin products relative to our higher margin products, which could reduce our future profitability.\nBusiness Wins and Losses\nOur customers consist mainly of wholesalers and retail home centers. In fiscal year 2017, our top ten customers together accounted for approximately 44% of our net sales and our top customer, The Home Depot, Inc. accounted for approximately 18% of our net sales in fiscal year 2017. Net sales from customers that have accounted for a significant portion of our net sales in past periods, individually or as a group, may not continue in future periods, or if continued, may not reach or exceed historical levels in any period. Certain customers perform periodic product line reviews to assess their product offerings, which have, on past occasions, led to business wins and losses. In addition, as a result of competitive bidding processes, we may not be able to increase or maintain the margins at which we sell our products to our customers.\nOrganizational Restructuring\nOver the past several years we have initiated, and in the future we may initiate, restructuring plans designed to eliminate excess capacity in order to align our manufacturing capabilities with reductions in demand, as well as to streamline our organizational structure and reposition our business for improved long-term profitability.\nDuring 2016, we began implementing a plan (the \"2016 Plan\") to close one manufacturing facility in the Architectural segment, which included the reduction of approximately 140 positions. The 2016 Plan was implemented to improve our cost structure and enhance operational efficiencies. Costs associated with the 2016 Plan include closure costs and severance and the 2016 Plan is substantially completed. As of December 31, 2017, we do not expect to incur any future charges relating to the 2016 Plan. The actions taken as part of the 2016 Plan are expected to increase our annual earnings and cash flows by approximately $4 million.\nDuring 2015, we began implementing a multi-year plan to reorganize and consolidate certain aspects of our global head office (the \"2015 Plan\"). The 2015 Plan includes the creation of a new shared services function and the rationalization of certain of our European facilities, including related headcount reductions. The 2015 Plan was implemented in response to the need for more effective business processes enabled by the planned implementation of our\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nnew enterprise resource planning system in our architectural business as well as ongoing weak market conditions in Africa and Europe outside of the United Kingdom. Costs associated with the 2015 Plan included severance and closure charges and are substantially completed. As of December 31, 2017, we do not expect to incur any material future charges for the 2015 Plan. Once fully implemented, the actions taken as part of the 2015 Plan are estimated to increase our annual earnings and cash flows by approximately $6 million.\nForeign Exchange Rate Fluctuation\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuating exchange rates. In the years ended December 31, 2017, January 1, 2017, and January 3, 2016 approximately 34%, 35% and 36% of our net sales were generated outside of the United States, respectively. In addition, a significant percentage of our costs during the same period were not denominated in U.S. dollars. For example, for most of our manufacturing and distribution facilities, the prices for a significant portion of our raw materials are quoted in the domestic currency of the country where the facility is located or other currencies that are not U.S. dollars. We also have substantial assets outside the United States. As a result, the volatility in the price of the U.S. dollar has exposed, and in the future may continue to expose, us to currency exchange risks. Also, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on many aspects of our financial results. Changes in currency exchange rates for any country in which we operate may require us to raise the prices of our products in that country or allow our competitors to sell their products at lower prices in that country. Unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of the financial statements of our non-U.S. functional currency operations are accumulated in the cumulative translation adjustments account in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Net gains from currency translation adjustments as a result of translating our foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars during the year ended December 31, 2017, were $39.0 million, which were primarily driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the other major currencies in which we transact.\nInflation\nAn increase in inflation could have a significant impact on the cost of our raw material inputs. Wage inflation, increased prices for raw materials or finished goods used in our products and/or interruptions in deliveries of raw materials or finished goods could adversely affect our profitability, margins and net sales, particularly if we are not able to pass these incurred costs on to our customers. In addition, interest rates normally increase during periods of rising inflation. Historically, as interest rates increase, demand for new homes and home improvement products decreases. An environment of gradual interest rate increases may, however, signify an improving economy or increasing real estate values, which in turn may stimulate increased home buying activity.\nSeasonality\nOur business is moderately seasonal and our net sales vary from quarter to quarter based upon the timing of the building season in our markets. Severe weather conditions in any quarter, such as unusually prolonged warm or cold conditions, rain, blizzards or hurricanes, could accelerate, delay or halt construction and renovation activity.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nWe are pursuing a strategic initiative of optimizing our global business portfolio. As part of this strategy, in the last several years we have pursued strategic acquisitions targeting companies who produce components for our existing operations, manufacture niche products and provide value-added services. Additionally, we target companies with strong brands, complementary technologies, attractive geographic footprints and opportunities for cost and distribution synergies. We also continuously analyze our operations to determine which businesses, market channels and products create the most value for our customers and acceptable returns for our shareholders.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nAcquisitions\n \u2022 DW3: On January 29, 2018, we completed the acquisition of DW3 Products Holdings Limited ( DW3\u201d), a leading UK provider of high quality premium door solutions and window systems, supplying products under brand names such as Solidor, Residor, Nicedor and Residence. We acquired 100% of the equity interests in DW3 for consideration of approximately $96 million, net of cash acquired. DW3 is based in Stoke-on-Trent and Gloucester, England, and their products and service model are a natural addition to our existing UK business. DW3's online quick ship capabilities and product portfolio both complement and expand the strategies we are pursuing with our business. \n \u2022 A&F: On October 2, 2017 we completed the acquisition of A&F Wood Products, Inc. ( A&F\u201d), through the purchase of 100% of the equity interests in A&F and certain assets of affiliates of A&F for consideration of $13.8 million, net of cash acquired. A&F is based in Howell, Michigan, and is a wholesaler and fabricator of architectural and commercial doors in the Midwest United States. \n \u2022 FyreWerks: On November 3, 2016 we completed the acquisition of FyreWerks, Inc. ( FyreWerks\u201d), based in Westminster, Colorado. We acquired 100% of the equity interests in FyreWerks for consideration of $8.0 million, net of cash acquired. FyreWerks manufactures certified fire door core and frame components for use with architectural stile and rail wood panel doors and door frames. The FyreWerks acquisition complements our existing Architectural components business. \n \u2022 USA Wood Door: On October 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of USA Wood Door, Inc. ( USA Wood Door\u201d), based in Thorofare, New Jersey. We acquired 100% of the equity interests in USA Wood Door for consideration of $13.7 million, net of cash acquired. USA Wood Door is a supplier of architectural and commercial wood doors in the Eastern United States providing door and hardware distributors with machined, re-sized and value-added additions to both unfinished and prefinished doors in short lead times. \n \u2022 Hickman: On August 5, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Hickman Industries Limited ( Hickman\u201d), a leading supplier of doorkits (similar to fully finished prehung door units) and other millwork in the United Kingdom. We acquired 100% of the equity interests in Hickman for consideration of $88.0 million, net of cash acquired. Hickman is headquartered in Wolverhampton, England, and their leadership in providing doorkit solutions to the homebuilder market in the United Kingdom is a natural extension of our existing business in the United Kingdom. Hickman's deployment of automation and product line leadership complements the strategies we are pursuing with our business. \n \u2022 PDS: On July 23, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Performance Doorset Solutions ( PDS\u201d), a leading supplier of custom doors and millwork in the United Kingdom that specializes in non-standard product specifications, manufacturing both wood and composite solutions. We acquired 100% of the equity interests in PDS for consideration of $15.7 million, net of cash acquired. PDS is based in Lancashire, United Kingdom, and is a producer of high quality niche product lines that complement our existing United Kingdom business.  Dispositions\n \u2022 South Africa: On December 22, 2015, following a comprehensive assessment of Masonite (Africa) Limited ( MAL\u201d), our South African subsidiary, the MAL Board of Directors approved a plan to enter into Business Rescue proceedings, the South African equivalent of bankruptcy proceedings in the United States, similar to a Chapter 11 reorganization. As a result of this plan, a Business Rescue Practitioner was appointed to manage the affairs of the business and we no longer maintained operational control over MAL. For this reason, we deconsolidated MAL effective December 22, 2015.  Subsequent to deconsolidation, we used the cost method to account for our equity investment in MAL, which was reflected as $10.0 million in our consolidated balance sheets as of January 1, 2017, based on the estimated fair value of our portion of MAL's net assets on the date of deconsolidation. During September 2016, we received $15.1 million as final pre-tax proceeds from the sale of our equity interest in MAL. Upon receipt of these proceeds, our equity interest in MAL was eliminated and we accordingly reduced the value of our cost investment in MAL to zero and recorded a gain on disposal of subsidiaries of $5.1 million.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\n \u2022 France: On July 31, 2015, we completed the sale of all of the capital stock of Premdor, S.A.S., Masonite's door business in France, to a Paris-based independent investment firm (the \"Buyer\"). Pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated July 16, 2015, the Buyer acquired all of Masonite's door manufacturing and distribution business in France for nominal consideration. \nComponents of Results of Operations\nNet Sales\nNet sales are derived from the sale of products to our customers. We recognize sales of our products when an agreement with the customer in the form of a sales order is in place, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collection is reasonably assured and the customer has taken ownership and assumes risk of loss. Certain customers are eligible to participate in various incentive and rebate programs considered as a reduction of the sales price of our products. Accordingly, net sales are reported net of such incentives and rebates. Additionally, shipping and other transportation costs charged to customers are recorded in net sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nCost of Goods Sold\nOur cost of goods sold is comprised of the cost to manufacture products for our customers and includes the cost of materials, direct labor, overhead, distribution and depreciation associated with assets used to manufacture products. Research and development costs are primarily included within cost of goods sold. We incur significant fixed and variable overhead at our global component locations that manufacture interior molded door facings. Our overall average production capacity utilization at these locations was approximately 77%, 77%, and 68% for the years ended December 31, 2017, January 1, 2017, and January 3, 2016.\nSelling, General and Administration Expenses\nSelling, general and administration expenses primarily include the costs for our sales organization and support staff at various plants and corporate offices. These costs include personnel costs for payroll, related benefits and stock based compensation expense; professional fees including legal, accounting and consulting fees; depreciation and amortization of our non-manufacturing equipment and assets; travel and entertainment expenses; director, officer and other insurance policies; environmental, health and safety costs; advertising expenses and rent and utilities related to administrative office facilities. Certain charges that are also incurred less frequently and are included in selling, general and administration costs include gain or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment and bad debt expense.\nRestructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs include all salary-related severance benefits that are accrued and expensed when a restructuring plan has been put into place, the plan has received approval from the appropriate level of management and the benefit is probable and reasonably estimable. In addition to salary-related costs, we incur other restructuring costs when facilities are closed or capacity is realigned within the organization. Upon termination of a contract we record liabilities and expenses pursuant to the terms of the relevant agreement. For non-contractual restructuring activities, liabilities and expenses are measured and recorded at fair value in the period in which they are incurred.\nAsset Impairment\nAsset impairment includes charges that are taken when impairment testing indicates that the carrying values of our long-lived assets or asset groups exceed their respective fair values. Definite-lived assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are tested annually for impairment on the last day of fiscal November, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of the asset or asset group being tested exceeds its fair value, except in the case of goodwill, which is tested based on the fair value of the reporting unit where the goodwill is recorded.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nLoss (Gain) on Disposal of Subsidiaries\nLoss (gain) on disposal of subsidiaries represents the difference between proceeds received upon disposition and the book value of a subsidiary which has been divested and was excluded from treatment as a discontinued operation. Also included in loss (gain) on disposal of subsidiaries is recognition of the cumulative translation adjustment out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net relates primarily to our consolidated senior unsecured indebtedness. Subsequent to March 23, 2015, interest expense, net relates to our $625.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2023 (the \"2023 Notes\"). Prior to March 23, 2015, interest expense related to our $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2021, which were redeemed on March 23, 2015, concurrent with the issuance of the 2023 Notes. Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the 2023 Notes were capitalized as a reduction to the carrying value of debt and are being accreted to interest expense over their respective terms. The most recent issuance of our 2023 Notes resulted in a premium that is amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2023 Notes. Additionally, we pay interest on any outstanding principal under our ABL Facility and we are required to pay a commitment fee for unutilized commitments under the ABL Facility, both of which are recorded in interest expense as incurred.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt represents the difference between the reacquisition price of debt and the net carrying amount of the extinguished debt. The net carrying amount includes the principal, unamortized premium and unamortized debt issuance costs.\nOther Expense (Income), Net\nOther expense (income), net includes profits and losses related to our non-majority owned unconsolidated subsidiaries that we recognize under the equity method of accounting, unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency remeasurements, pension settlement charges and other miscellaneous non-operating expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the deferred tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is anticipated to be realized on a more likely than not basis. Our combined effective income tax rate is primarily the weighted average of federal, state and provincial rates in various countries where we have operations, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Our income tax rate is also affected by estimates of our ability to realize tax assets and changes in tax laws.\nOn December 22, 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Reform\"). Among other items, Tax Reform reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. This has caused our net deferred tax liabilities in the U.S. to be revalued.\nSegment Information\nOur reportable segments are organized and managed principally by end market: North American Residential, Europe and Architectural. The North American Residential reportable segment is the aggregation of the Wholesale and Retail operating segments. The Europe reportable segment is the aggregation of the United Kingdom, Central Eastern Europe and France (prior to disposal) operating segments. The Architectural reportable segment consists solely of the Architectural operating segment. The Corporate & Other category includes unallocated corporate costs and the results of immaterial operating segments which were not aggregated into any reportable segment, including the historical results of our Africa operating segment (prior to deconsolidation). Operating segments are aggregated into reportable segments only if they exhibit similar economic characteristics. In addition to similar economic characteristics we also consider the\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nfollowing factors in determining the reportable segments: the nature of business activities, the management structure directly accountable to our chief operating decision maker for operating and administrative activities, availability of discrete financial information and information presented to the Board of Directors and investors.\nOur management reviews net sales and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Net assets are not allocated to the reportable segments. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which does not have a standardized meaning under GAAP and is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to either net income or operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Masonite adjusted to exclude the following items:\n \u2022 depreciation; \n \u2022 amortization; \n \u2022 share based compensation expense; \n \u2022 loss (gain) on disposal of property, plant and equipment; \n \u2022 registration and listing fees; \n \u2022 restructuring costs; \n \u2022 asset impairment; \n \u2022 loss (gain) on disposal of subsidiaries; \n \u2022 interest expense (income), net; \n \u2022 loss on extinguishment of debt; \n \u2022 other expense (income), net; \n \u2022 income tax expense (benefit); \n \u2022 loss (income) from discontinued operations, net of tax; and \n \u2022 net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest.  This definition of Adjusted EBITDA differs from the definitions of EBITDA contained in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes and the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility. Adjusted EBITDA is used to evaluate and compare the performance of the segments and it is one of the primary measures used to determine employee incentive compensation. Intersegment transfers are negotiated on an arm's length basis, using market prices.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA, from an operations standpoint, provides an appropriate way to measure and assess segment performance. Our management team has established the practice of reviewing the performance of each segment based on the measures of net sales and Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to users of the consolidated financial statements because it provides the same information that we use internally to evaluate and compare the performance of the segments and it is one of the primary measures used to determine employee incentive compensation.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nResults of Operations Table 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 3, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,032,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,973,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,871,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>1,625,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,564,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,521,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>406,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>409,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit as a % of net sales\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administration expenses\n</td> <td>246,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>260,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>244,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administration expenses as a % of net sales\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring costs, net\n</td> <td>850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss (gain) on disposal of subsidiaries\n</td> <td>212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,575\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>159,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense (income), net\n</td> <td>30,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense (income), net\n</td> <td>(1,091\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,959\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,757\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>130,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,569\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>(27,560\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations\n</td> <td>157,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41,741\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>(583\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(752\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(908\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>156,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,649\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest\n</td> <td>5,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to Masonite\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(47,111\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2017, Compared with Year Ended January 1, 2017\nNet Sales\nNet sales in the year ended December 31, 2017, were $2,032.9 million, an increase of $58.9 million or 3.0% from $1,974.0 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Net sales in 2017 were negatively impacted by $6.6 million as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $65.5 million or 3.3% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Average unit price in 2017 increased net sales by $47.4 million or 2.4% compared to 2016. Higher volume in 2017 increased net sales by $21.9 million or 1.1% compared to 2016. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased net sales of components and other products to external customers, which were $3.8 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016. The change in volume includes the incremental impacts of acquisitions and dispositions.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nNet Sales and Percentage of Net Sales by Reportable Segment Table 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 1, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Residential\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,433,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,357,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Residential intersegment\n</td> <td>(4,338\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,926\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Residential net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>1,428,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,351,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>70.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe\n</td> <td>295,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe intersegment\n</td> <td>(3,936\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,543\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>291,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>301,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Architectural\n</td> <td>307,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>312,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Architectural intersegment\n</td> <td>(18,773\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,353\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Architectural net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>288,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate & Other net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>23,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,032,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,973,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNorth American Residential\nNet sales to external customers from facilities in the North American Residential segment in the year ended December 31, 2017, were $1,428.9 million, an increase of $77.6 million or 5.7% from $1,351.3 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Net sales in 2017 were positively impacted by $5.0 million as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $72.6 million or 5.4% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Higher volume in 2017 increased net sales by $44.0 million or 3.3% compared to 2016. Average unit price increased net sales in 2017 by $30.5 million or 2.3% compared to 2016. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased net sales of components and other products to external customers, which were $1.9 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016.\nEurope\nNet sales to external customers from facilities in the Europe segment in the year ended December 31, 2017, were $291.9 million, a decrease of $9.3 million or 3.1% from $301.2 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Net sales in 2017 were negatively impacted by $12.1 million as a result of foreign exchange fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $2.8 million or 0.9% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Average unit price increased net sales in 2017 by $5.6 million or 1.9% compared to 2016. Higher volume in 2017 increased net sales by $0.3 million or 0.1% compared to 2016. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased net sales of components and other products to external customers, which were $3.1 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016.\nArchitectural\nNet sales to external customers from facilities in the Architectural segment in the year ended December 31, 2017, were $288.5 million, a decrease of $9.4 million or 3.2% from $297.9 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Net sales in 2017 were positively impacted by $0.6 million as a result of foreign exchange fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have decreased by $10.0 million or 3.4% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Lower volume decreased net sales in 2017 by $23.2 million or 7.8%\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\ncompared to 2016. Partially offsetting this decrease, average unit price increased net sales in 2017 by $11.3 million or 3.8% compared to 2016. Net sales of components and other products to external customers were $1.9 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016. The change in volume includes the incremental impact of acquisitions and dispositions.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 80.0% and 79.2% for the years ended December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2017, respectively. Distribution, overhead and direct labor as a percentage of sales increased by 0.9%, 0.6% and 0.2%, respectively, over the 2016 period. The distribution increase was due to inflationary pressures, shipping inefficiencies related to maintaining customer service levels and costs to complete the ramp-up of new retail business. The overhead and direct labor increases were driven by operational inefficiencies and wage inflation, partly offset by headcount reductions. Material cost of sales and depreciation as a percentage of net sales in 2017 decreased 0.8% and 0.1%, respectively, over the 2016 period. The decrease in material cost of sales was driven by favorable average unit prices partially offset by a combination of inflation and inbound freight increases.\nSelling, General and Administration Expenses\nIn the year ended December 31, 2017, selling, general and administration expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 12.1% compared to 13.2% in the year ended January 1, 2017, a decrease of 110 basis points.\nSelling, general and administration expenses in the year ended December 31, 2017, were $246.9 million, a decrease of $13.5 million from $260.4 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. The decrease included a $6.3 million reduction of non-cash items in SG&A expenses, including share based compensation, depreciation and amortization, deferred compensation and loss on sale of fixed assets. The overall decrease was also driven by a $12.2 million decrease in personnel costs, primarily due to a reduction in our incentive pay accrual, and favorable foreign exchange impacts of $1.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by a $3.6 million increase in marketing costs relating to our re-branding, a net incremental increase of $0.5 million due to acquisitions and other increases of $2.3 million.\nRestructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs in the year ended December 31, 2017, were $0.9 million, compared to $1.4 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Restructuring costs in 2017 related to the final severance and closure costs for the 2016 plan, partly offset by the receipt of $1.1 million as final settlement in the Stay of Proceedings in Israel as part of the 2014 Plan and other reductions to the 2014 Plan accrual. Restructuring costs in 2016 primarily related to the severance costs incurred during the implementation of the 2016 Plan.\nAsset Impairment\nAsset impairment charges were $1.5 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. There were no asset impairment charges in the year ended December 31, 2017. Asset impairment charges in 2016 resulted from restructuring actions associated with the 2016 Plan.\nLoss (Gain) on Disposal of Subsidiaries\nLoss on disposal of subsidiaries was $0.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the gain on disposal of subsidiaries of $6.6 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. The current year loss arose as a result of the liquidation of our legal entity in Hungary. The gain in 2016 arose as a result of the sale of our equity interest in MAL and the liquidation of our legal entity in Romania. The current year loss and the prior year gain related to Hungary and Romania are comprised of the recognition of the cumulative translation adjustment out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The prior year gain relating to MAL represents the excess of pre-tax cash received upon closing of the sale over the book value of the investment.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net, in the year ended December 31, 2017, was $30.2 million, compared to $28.2 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. This increase primarily relates to the issuance of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional 2023 Senior Notes on September 27, 2017.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nOther Expense (Income), Net\nOther expense (income), net, in the year ended December 31, 2017, was $(1.1) million, compared to $(2.0) million in the year ended January 1, 2017. The change in other expense (income), net, is primarily due to unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency remeasurements. Also contributing to the change were our portion of dividends and the net gains and losses related to our non-majority owned unconsolidated subsidiaries that are recognized under the equity method of accounting and other miscellaneous non-operating expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nOur income tax (benefit) in the year ended December 31, 2017, was $(27.6) million, a change of $49.3 million from $21.8 million of income tax expense in the year ended January 1, 2017. The increase in income tax benefit is primarily attributable to recognition of $24.1 million of deferred tax assets in Canada through reversal of valuation allowances, a $27.2 million increase in income tax benefit associated with the change in enacted tax rate applied to existing U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities due to U.S. Tax Reform, the mix of income or losses within the tax jurisdictions with various tax rates in which we operate and losses in tax jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances as of December 31, 2017.\nSegment Information Table 113: <table><tr><td>

from $212.6 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA in the North American Residential segment included corporate allocations of shared costs of $54.7 million and $50.7 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The allocations generally consist of certain costs of human resources, legal, finance, information technology, research and development and share based compensation.\nAdjusted EBITDA in our Europe segment decreased $5.2 million, or 13.4%, to $33.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, from $38.8 million in the year ended January 1, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA in our Architectural segment increased $4.9 million or 19.4% to $30.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, from $25.2 million in the year ended January 1, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA in the Architectural segment also included corporate allocations of shared costs of $8.9 million and $7.8 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The allocations generally consist of certain costs of human resources, legal, finance and information technology.\nYear Ended January 1, 2017, Compared with Year Ended January 3, 2016\nOur fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday closest to December 31. In a 52-week year, each fiscal quarter consists of 13 weeks. For ease of disclosure, the 13-week periods are referred to as three-month periods and the 52- or 53-week periods are referred to as years. Our 2015 fiscal year, which ended on January 3, 2016, contained 53 weeks of operating results, with the additional week occurring in the fourth quarter.\nNet Sales\nNet sales in the year ended January 1, 2017, were $1,974.0 million, an increase of $102.0 million or 5.4% from $1,872.0 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Net sales in 2016 were negatively impacted by $47.4 million as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $149.4 million or 8.0% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Higher volume in 2016 increased net sales by $99.2 million or 5.3% compared to 2015. Average unit price in 2016 increased net sales by $48.8 million or 2.6% compared to 2015. Also contributing to this increase were higher net sales of components and other products to external customers, which were $1.4 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015. The change in volume includes the incremental impacts of acquisitions and dispositions.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nNet Sales and Percentage of Net Sales by Reportable Segment Table 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>January 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 3, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Residential\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,357,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,197,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Residential intersegment\n</td> <td>(5,926\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,106\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Residential net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>1,351,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,193,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>68.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe\n</td> <td>305,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>312,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe intersegment\n</td> <td>(4,543\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(719\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>301,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>311,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Architectural\n</td> <td>312,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>302,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Architectural intersegment\n</td> <td>(14,353\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Architectural net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>297,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>291,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate & Other net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>23,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales to external customers\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,973,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,871,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNorth American Residential\nNet sales to external customers from facilities in the North American Residential segment in the year ended January 1, 2017, were $1,351.3 million, an increase of $158.1 million or 13.3% from $1,193.2 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Net sales in 2016 were negatively impacted by $17.8 million as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $175.9 million or 14.7% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Higher volume in 2016 increased net sales by $160.4 million or 13.4% compared to 2015. Average unit price increased net sales in 2016 by $14.2 million or 1.2% compared to 2015. Also contributing to this increase were higher net sales of components and other products to external customers, which were $1.3 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015.\nEurope\nNet sales to external customers from facilities in the Europe segment in the year ended January 1, 2017, were $301.2 million, a decrease of $10.6 million or 3.4% from $311.8 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Net sales in 2016 were negatively impacted by $28.0 million as a result of foreign exchange fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $17.4 million or 5.6% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Average unit price increased net sales in 2016 by $24.2 million or 7.8% compared to 2015. Partially offsetting this increase were lower volume in 2016, which decreased net sales by $4.8 million or 1.5%, and net sales of components and other products to external customers, which were $2.0 million lower in 2016 compared to 2015. The change in volume includes the incremental impacts of acquisitions and dispositions.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nArchitectural\nNet sales to external customers from facilities in the Architectural segment in the year ended January 1, 2017, were $297.9 million, an increase of $6.1 million or 2.1% from $291.8 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Net sales in 2016 were negatively impacted by $1.3 million as a result of foreign exchange fluctuations. Excluding this exchange rate impact, net sales would have increased by $7.4 million or 2.5% due to changes in volume, average unit price and sales of components and other products. Average unit price increased net sales in 2016 by $10.4 million or 3.6% compared to 2015. Net sales of components and other products to external customers were $2.4 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015. Lower volume decreased net sales in 2016 by $5.4 million or 1.9%.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 79.2% and 81.3% for the year ended January 1, 2017, and January 3, 2016, respectively. The primary reasons for the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales were the favorable impact of average unit price on our net sales, our increased operating leverage and our continued cost control efforts. Material cost of sales, overhead and depreciation as a percentage of net sales in 2016 decreased 1.5%, 0.7%, 0.3%, respectively, over the 2015 period. Direct labor and distribution as a percentage of sales increased by 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively, over the 2015 period.\nSelling, General and Administration Expenses\nIn the year ended January 1, 2017, selling, general and administration expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 13.2% compared to 13.0% in the year ended January 3, 2016, an increase of 20 basis points.\nSelling, general and administration expenses in the year ended January 1, 2017, were $260.4 million, an increase of $16.3 million from $244.1 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. The increase included $6.7 million of non-cash items in SG&A expenses, including share based compensation, depreciation and amortization, deferred compensation and loss on sale of fixed assets. The increase was also driven by an $8.3 million increase in personnel costs due to a combination of wage inflation and investments in additional personnel, a $3.9 million increase in professional fees, primarily related to IT and digital initiatives, a $1.2 million increase in marketing costs, a $0.8 million increase in travel expenses and other increases of $0.8 million. These increases were partially offset by favorable foreign exchange impacts of $5.0 million and a net incremental decrease of $0.4 million due to acquisitions and dispositions.\nRestructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs in the year ended January 1, 2017, were $1.4 million, compared to $5.7 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Restructuring costs in 2016 were related primarily to expenses incurred as part of the 2016 Plan. Costs incurred in 2015 were related primarily to the 2015 Plan.\nAsset Impairment\nAsset impairment charges were $1.5 million in the year ended January 1, 2017, compared to $9.4 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. Asset impairment charges in 2016 resulted from restructuring actions associated with the 2016 Plan. Asset impairment charges in 2015 resulted from the sale of Premdor S.A.S., Masonite's door business in France, which was determined to be a triggering event requiring a test of the indefinite-lived trade name assets of the Europe segment. This charge represents the excess of the carrying value over the fair value as determined using the relief of royalty discounted cash flows method.\nLoss (Gain) on Disposal of Subsidiaries\nGain on disposal of subsidiaries was $6.6 million in the year ended January 1, 2017, compared to the loss on disposal of subsidiaries of $60.0 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. The gain in 2016 arose as a result of the sale of our equity interest in MAL and the liquidation of our legal entity in Romania. The gain relating to MAL represents the excess of pre-tax cash received upon closing of the sale over the book value of the investment, and the gain relating to Romania is comprised of the recognition of the cumulative translation adjustment out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The charge in 2015 arose as a result of the deconsolidation of MAL and the disposition of Premdor S.A.S., our door business in France.\nMASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net, in the year ended January 1, 2017, was $28.2 million, compared to $32.9 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. This decrease primarily relates to the refinancing of $500.0 million of 8.25% senior unsecured notes for $475.0 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes issued on March 23, 2015.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was zero in the year ended January 1, 2017, compared to $28.0 million in the year ended January 3, 2016. The charge in 2015 represents the difference between the redemption price of our senior unsecured notes due 2021 of $531.7 million and the net carrying amount of such notes of $503.7 million. In addition to the $500.0 million of principal, the redemption price included a make-whole premium of $31.7 million and the net carrying amount included unamortized premiums of $11.5 million, partially offset by unamortized debt issuance costs of $7.8 million.\nOther Expense (Income), Net\nOther expense (income), net, in the year ended January 1, 2017, was $(2.0) million, compared to $(1.8) million in the year ended January 3, 2016. The change in other expense (income), net, is primarily due to unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency remeasurements. Also contributing to the change were our portion of dividends and the net gains and losses related to our non-majority owned unconsolidated subsidiary that are recognized under the equity method of accounting and other miscellaneous non-operating expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nOur income tax expense in the year ended January 1, 2017, was $21.8 million, an increase of $7.6 million from $14.2 million of income tax expense in the year ended January 3, 2016. The increase in income tax expense (benefit) is primarily due to the mix of income or losses within the tax jurisdictions with various tax rates in which we operate and losses in tax jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances.\nSegment Information Table 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
