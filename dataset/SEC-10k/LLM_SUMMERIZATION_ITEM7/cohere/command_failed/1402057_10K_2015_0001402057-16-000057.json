Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nUnless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d the terms we,\u201d us,\u201d the Company,\u201d our,\u201d CDW\u201d and similar terms refer to CDW Corporation and its subsidiaries. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above.\nOverview\nCDW is a Fortune 500 company and a leading provider of integrated information technology ( IT\u201d) solutions in North America and the United Kingdom. We help our customer base of over 250,000 small, medium and large business, government, education and healthcare customers by delivering critical solutions to their increasingly complex IT needs. Our broad array of offerings ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated IT solutions such as mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization and collaboration. We are technology agnostic,\u201d with a product portfolio including more than 100,000 products from more than 1,000 brands. We provide our products and solutions through more than 5,000 customer-facing coworkers, including field sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers.\nWe are a leading sales channel partner in North America and the United Kingdom for many original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d) and software publishers (collectively, our vendor partners\u201d), whose products we sell or include in the solutions we offer. We believe we are an important extension of our vendor partners' sales and marketing capabilities, providing them with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our established end-market coverage and extensive customer access.\nOn August 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Kelway TopCo Limited ( Kelway\u201d) by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock which increased our ownership interest from 35% to 100%, and provided us control. Kelway is a U.K.-based IT solutions provider, which has global supply chain relationships that enable it to conduct business in more than 80 countries. This investment strengthens our ability to provide a more comprehensive solution to our customers and enhances our ability to serve our existing multi-national customers. We included the financial results of Kelway in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. For additional information relating to the acquisition, see Note 3 (Acquisition) to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe have two reportable segments: Corporate, which is comprised primarily of private sector business customers in the U.S., and Public, which is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions in the U.S. Our Corporate segment is divided into a medium/large business customer channel, primarily serving customers with more than 100 employees, and a small business customer channel, primarily serving customers with up to 100 employees. We also have three other operating segments: CDW Advanced Services; Canada; and Kelway, each of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are included in an all other category ( Other\u201d). For additional information relating to Kelway, see Note 3 (Acquisition) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. The CDW Advanced Services business consists primarily of customized engineering services delivered by technology specialists and engineers, and managed services that include Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS\u201d) offerings. Effective January 1, 2016, the CDW Advanced Services business will be included in our Corporate and Public segments and Other will be comprised of Canada and Kelway. Revenues in the U.S. from the sale of hardware, software, custom configuration and third-party provided services are recorded within our Corporate and Public segments.\nWe may sell all or only select products that our vendor partners offer. Each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions, which may include one or more of the following: product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs, such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements. We also resell software for major software publishers. Our agreements with software publishers allow the end-user customer to acquire software or licensed products and services. In addition to helping our customers determine the best software solutions for their needs, we help them manage their software agreements, including warranties and renewals. A significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses is reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs with our vendor partners. These programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are typically tied to sales or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time.\nTrends and Key Factors Affecting our Financial Performance\nWe believe the following trends may have an important impact on our financial performance:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our Public segment sales are impacted by government spending policies, budget priorities and revenue levels. An adverse change in any of these factors could cause our Public segment customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew contracts with us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2015, sales to federal customers increased year-over-year in the mid-teens as we continued to benefit from strategic changes made to better align with new federal government purchasing programs implemented last year. During the same period, sales to state and local customers also increased year-over-year in the mid-teens, driven by the continued focus on public safety. Meeting K-12 customer digital curriculum testing needs through sales of client devices was a significant contributor to education sales throughout 2014 and into early 2015. Education sales decreased slightly in 2015 as a decline in K-12 client device sales was partially offset by an increase in netcomm sales. In 2015, we were named as provider on both the largest number of applications and the largest dollar amounts requested for funds by K-12 customers to support internal connections for the 2014-2015 program year of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission E-Rate program. The amount and timing of E-Rate funds approval and customer implementation is not certain.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An important factor affecting our ability to generate sales and achieve our targeted operating results is the impact of general economic conditions on our customers' willingness to spend on information technology. During the year ended December 31, 2015, global economic signals were mixed. We continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions. Uncertainties related to potential changes in tax and regulatory policy, potential interest rate increases, weakening consumer and business confidence or increased unemployment could result in reduced or deferred spending on information technology products and services by our customers and result in increased competitive pricing pressures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We believe that our customers' transition to more complex technology solutions will continue to be an important growth area for us in the future. However, because the market for technology products and services is highly competitive, our success at capitalizing on this transition will be based on our ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, the quality and breadth of our product and service offerings, the knowledge and expertise of our sales force, price, product availability and speed of delivery. During the year ended December 31, 2015, customer priorities continued to shift away from last year's focus on client devices towards more integrated solutions, which grew substantially faster than transactional sales.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Key Business Metrics\nOur management monitors a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary. We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, Net income, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per common share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, return on invested capital, Cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in Accounts receivable plus days of supply in Inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in Accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios, sales per coworker, and coworker turnover. These measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.\nNon-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these measures provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Adjusted EBITDA also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain key covenants and definitions contained in the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (the Term Loan\u201d), including the excess cash flow payment provision, the restricted payment covenant and the net leverage ratio. These covenants and definitions are material components of the Term Loan as they are used in determining the interest rate applicable to the Term Loan, our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt, and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments. For further details regarding the Term Loan, see Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. For the definitions of Non-GAAP net income and Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliations to Net income, see Results of Operations\u201d.\nThe results of certain key business metrics are as follows:\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,988.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,074.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,768.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>2,115.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,921.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,760.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>742.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>673.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>508.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>403.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>244.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP net income\n</td> <td>503.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>409.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>314.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>1,018.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>907.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>808.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average daily sales\n</td> <td>51.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net debt (defined as total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) (1)\n</td> <td>3,222.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,821.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,037.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash conversion cycle (in days) (2)\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-03 during the second quarter of 2015, historical periods have been revised to reflect the change in the presentation of deferred financing costs, which are now shown as a reduction of Long-term debt, instead of being presented as a separate asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the third quarter of 2015, we adopted ASU 2015-15 which allows entities to present deferred financing costs for line-of-credit arrangements as an asset.

sales in 2015 increased $914.2 million, or 7.6%, to $12,988.7 million, compared to $12,074.5 million in 2014, reflecting both organic net sales growth and the impact of consolidating five months of Kelway net sales. Customer priorities continued to shift more towards integrated solutions, which drove higher growth in solutions sales compared to transactional product sales. Strong sales performance in solutions-focused products was driven by netcomm and server and server-related products. The growth in transactional products was led by notebooks/mobile devices, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers.\nOrganic net sales, which excludes the impact of the acquisition of Kelway, increased $563.5 million, or 4.7%, to $12,638.0 million in 2015, compared to $12,074.5 million in 2014. Organic net sales on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, in 2015 increased $635.0 million, or 5.3%, to $12,638.0 million, compared to $12,003.0 million in 2014. For additional information, see Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations\u201d below.\nCorporate segment net sales in 2015 increased $340.9 million, or 5.3%, compared to 2014, driven by sales growth in both our medium/large and small business customer channels and reflecting stronger performance in solutions sales compared to transactional product sales. Within our Corporate segment, net sales to medium/large customers increased $272.8 million, or 5.0%, year over year, primarily due to strong sales performance in solutions-focused products driven by netcomm products and server and server-related products. Growth in transactional products was driven by notebook/mobile devices, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers. Net sales to small business customers increased by $68.1 million, or 6.9%, between periods, driven by growth in notebooks/mobile devices and netcomm products, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers.\nPublic segment net sales in 2015 increased $246.1 million, or 5.0%, between years, due to strong sales performance in government and growth in healthcare, partially offset by education remaining relatively flat. Net sales to government customers increased $226.5 million, or 15.6%, between periods, as sales to both federal and state/local government customers experienced mid-teens growth. The increase in net sales to the federal government was driven by growth in sales of netcomm products, software and enterprise storage, as we continued to benefit from strategic changes made to better align with new federal government purchasing programs implemented last year. A continued focus on public safety drove the increase in net sales to state/local government customers, which was led by netcomm products, notebooks/mobile devices and software, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers. Net sales to education customers decreased $17.0 million, or 0.9%, year over year, primarily due to declines in notebooks/mobile devices, partially offset by growth in netcomm products. Net sales to healthcare customers increased $36.6 million, or 2.3%, year over year, driven by growth in netcomm and server-related products, partially offset by declines in desktop\ncomputers and point-of-care technology carts, as some of our larger customers shifted priorities to reducing costs due to industry consolidation.\nNet sales in Other in 2015 increased $327.2 million, or 45.5%, compared 2014. Other is comprised of CDW Advanced Services, Canada and Kelway. The increase in net sales was driven by the impact of consolidating five months of Kelway net sales, as well as growth in CDW Advanced Services, partially offset by a decline in the U.S. dollar-denominated net sales of Canada. The net sales of Canada in constant currency continued to grow during 2015 compared to 2014.\nGross profit\nGross profit increased $194.5 million, or 10.1%, to $2,115.8 million in 2015, compared to $1,921.3 million in 2014. As a percentage of net sales, Gross profit increased 40 basis points to 16.3% in 2015, from 15.9% in 2014.\nNet service contract revenue, including items such as third-party services, warranties and SaaS contributed a positive impact of 15 basis points to gross profit margin as our cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales, resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction. Gross profit margin was positively impacted 15 basis points due to a higher mix of services and improved product margin. We also experienced a favorable impact of 10 basis points from vendor partner funding. Vendor partner funding includes purchase discounts, volume rebates and cooperative advertising.\nGross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors, including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs, cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales, product mix, net service contract revenue, commission revenue, pricing strategies, market conditions and other factors.\nSelling and administrative expenses\nSelling and administrative expenses increased $115.7 million, or 10.4%, to $1,226.0 million in 2015, compared to $1,110.3 million in 2014. As a percentage of total Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses increased 20 basis points to 9.4% in 2015, up from 9.2% in 2014. Sales payroll costs increased $60.1 million, or 12.0%, year over year, primarily due to increased sales compensation consistent with growth in solutions-related sales, an increase in Gross profit and consolidating five months of incremental Kelway sales payroll costs. In addition, certain coworker costs increased $9.5 million, or 3.8%, during 2015 compared to the prior year, due to higher costs consistent with increased coworker count, primarily due to our acquisition of Kelway. Total coworker count was 8,465 at December 31, 2015, up 1,254 from 7,211 at December 31, 2014. Amortization expense related to intangibles increased $16.7 million, or 9.2%, during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to incremental amortization expense related to the intangible assets arising from our acquisition of Kelway. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense increased $14.8 million, or 90.7%, during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to annual equity awards granted under our 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2015, performance against long-term incentive program targets and equity awards granted in connection with our acquisition of Kelway. In addition, we incurred $10.2 million of acquisition and integration costs in 2015 related to our acquisition of Kelway.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of Net sales, and the year-over-year percentage change for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars in\nMillions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\nMargin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars in\nMillions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\nMargin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\nin Income\nfrom Operations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segments: (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>470.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>439.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>343.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Headquarters (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(114.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(112.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>742.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>673.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Not meaningful\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Segment income from operations includes the segment's direct operating income, allocations for Headquarters' costs, allocations for income and expenses from logistics services, certain inventory adjustments and volume rebates and cooperative advertising from vendors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Includes the financial results for our other operating segments, CDW Advanced Services, Canada and five months for Kelway, which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Includes certain Headquarters' function costs that are not allocated to the segments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Income from operations was $742.0 million in 2015, an increase of $69.0 million, or 10.3%, compared to $673.0 million in 2014. Total operating margin increased 10 basis points to 5.7% in 2015, from 5.6% in 2014. Operating margin was positively impacted by the increase in gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales. This increase was driven by higher Net sales and Gross profit.\nCorporate segment income from operations was $470.1 million in 2015, an increase of $30.3 million, or 6.9%, compared to $439.8 million in 2014. Corporate segment operating margin increased 10 basis points to 6.9% in 2015, from 6.8% in 2014. This increase was driven by higher net sales and gross profit.\nPublic segment income from operations was $343.3 million in 2015, an increase of $30.1 million, or 9.6%, compared to $313.2 million in 2015. Public segment operating margin increased 30 basis points to 6.7% in 2015, from 6.4% in 2014. This increase was driven by higher net sales and gross profit.\nInterest expense, net\nAt December 31, 2015, our outstanding long-term debt totaled $3,259.7 million, compared to $3,166.0 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $93.7 million primarily due to the completion of the acquisition of Kelway. Net interest expense in 2015 was $159.5 million, a decrease of $37.8 million, compared to $197.3 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to lower effective interest rates for 2015, compared to 2014 as a result of redemptions and refinancing activities completed during 2014 and 2015.\nNet loss on extinguishments of long-term debt\nFor information regarding our debt, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

As a result, our previously held 35% equity investment was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of $98.1 million recorded in Gain on remeasurement of equity investment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense was $243.9 million in 2015, compared to $142.8 million in 2014. The effective income tax rate, expressed by calculating income tax expense or benefit as a percentage of income before income taxes, was 37.7% and 36.8% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFor 2015, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and withholding tax expense on the earnings of our Canadian business as a result of no longer asserting permanent reinvestment which was partially offset by a deferred tax benefit as a result of a tax rate reduction in the U.K. For 2014, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, including current year state income tax credits. The higher effective tax rate for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to higher state income taxes due to lower state income tax credits and the aforementioned Canadian withholding tax expense partially offset by the deferred tax benefit reflecting the tax rate reduction in the U.K. We are asserting that the unremitted earnings of our U.K. business are indefinitely reinvested.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations\nWe have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Organic net sales growth and Organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 below. Non-GAAP net income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, non-cash equity-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses and gains and losses from the extinguishment of long-term debt. EBITDA is defined as consolidated Net income before interest expense, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below. Organic net sales growth is calculated as net sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions recorded within the last twelve months. Organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis is calculated as organic net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on organic net sales compared to the prior period. Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Organic net sales growth and Organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by us may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nWe believe that Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Organic net sales growth and Organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Adjusted EBITDA is also the primary measure used in certain key covenants and definitions contained in the credit agreement governing our Term Loan, including the excess cash flow payment provision, the restricted payment covenant and the net leverage ratio. These covenants and definitions are material components of the Term Loan as they are used in determining the interest rate applicable to the Term Loan, our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments. For further details regarding the Term Loan, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-GAAP net income\nNon-GAAP net income was $503.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $93.6 million, or 22.8%, compared to $409.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>403.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash equity-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash equity-based compensation related to equity investment(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition and integration expenses(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on remeasurement of equity investment(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(98.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate adjustment for income taxes (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(103.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP net income(7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>503.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>409.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, customer contracts and trade names.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Represents our 35% share of an expense related to certain equity awards granted by one of the sellers to Kelway coworkers in July 2015 prior to our acquisition of Kelway.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Primarily includes expenses related to the acquisition of Kelway.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(4)\n</td> <td>Represents the gain resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held 35% equity investment to fair value upon the completion of the acquisition of Kelway.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(5)\n</td> <td>Primarily includes expenses related to the consolidation of office locations north of Chicago and secondary-offering-related expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(6)\n</td> <td>Based on a normalized effective tax rate of 38.0% (39.0% prior to the Kelway acquisition), except for the non-cash equity-based compensation from our equity investment and the gain resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held 35% equity investment to fair value upon the completion of the acquisition of Kelway, which were tax effected at a rate of 35.4%.

$10,768.6 million in 2013. The increase in total Net sales was primarily the result of continued growth in transactional products driven by notebooks/mobile devices and desktop computers, as customers across all channels refreshed their client devices and K-12 customers continued to prepare for digital testing requirements, and the addition of more than 140 customer-facing coworkers, the majority in pre- and post-sale technical positions such as technical specialists and service delivery roles. Growth in solutions-focused products, including netcomm and software, also contributed to the increase in Net sales during 2014.\nCorporate segment net sales in 2014 increased $515.4 million, or 8.6%, compared to 2013, driven by sales growth in the medium/large customer channel. Within our Corporate segment, net sales to medium/large customers increased $432.7 million, or 8.6%, year over year, primarily due to customers refreshing their client devices and making continued investments in technology infrastructure and a continued focus on seller productivity. This increase was led by growth in notebooks/mobile devices, netcomm products, software, and desktop computers. Net sales to small business customers increased $82.7 million, or 9.1%, year over year, driven by growth in notebooks/mobile devices and desktop computers due to customers refreshing their client devices.\nPublic segment net sales in 2014 increased $714.9 million, or 17.2%, year over year, driven by strong performance across all channels. In 2013, and through the second quarter of 2014, Public segment results were impacted by the combined and residual negative effects of sequestration, the partial shutdown of the federal government in 2013 and federal government budget uncertainty. However, with the finalization of federal budget allocations in early 2014, we began to see improvement in federal sales in the second quarter of 2014 and saw continued momentum through the third quarter of 2014 in conjunction with the federal fiscal year-end. This recovery continued into the fourth quarter of 2014 in connection with increased customer confidence that a federal budget for 2015 would be in place. Net sales to government customers increased $198.8 million, or 15.9%. The increase in net sales to the federal government was led by increases in sales of notebooks/mobile devices and desktop computers. The increase in net sales to state/local government customers was led by growth in sales of notebooks/mobile devices, netcomm products, enterprise storage, and software due to a continued focus on public safety solutions. Net sales to education customers increased $375.0 million, or 25.9%, year over year, led by growth in net sales to K-12 customers, reflecting increased sales of notebooks/mobile devices to support digital testing requirements. Net sales to healthcare customers increased $141.1 million, or 9.6%, between periods, driven by growth in netcomm products, notebook/mobile devices, and desktop computers.\nGross profit\nGross profit increased $161.0 million, or 9.1%, to $1,921.3 million in 2014, compared to $1,760.3 million in 2013. As a percentage of Net sales, Gross profit decreased 40 basis points to 15.9% during 2014, down from 16.3% in 2013. Gross profit margin was negatively impacted 30 basis points by unfavorable price/mix changes within product margin, as transactional product categories such as notebooks/mobile devices and desktops experienced a higher rate of net sales growth than our overall net sales growth, accompanied by continuing product margin compression in these product categories. Additionally, we experienced an unfavorable impact of 10 basis points from vendor funding in 2014. Although vendor funding dollars increased, it represented a lower percentage of Net sales in 2014 compared to 2013. Vendor funding includes purchase discounts, volume rebates and cooperative advertising.\nGross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors, including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs, cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales, product mix, net service contract revenue, commission revenue, pricing strategies, market conditions and other factors.\nSelling and administrative expenses\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased $10.6 million, or 0.9%, to $1,110.3 million in 2014, compared to $1,120.9 million in 2013. The overall decrease was largely driven by the absence of $74.3 million in costs incurred during 2013 related to the completion of our IPO. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $31.4 million, or 14.3%, of certain coworker costs between years which was primarily due to higher compensation consistent with increased coworker count and attainment-based compensation accruals tied to annual performance. Total coworker count was 7,211, up 244 from 6,967 at December 31, 2013. In addition, sales payroll, including sales commissions and other variable compensation costs, increased $18.6 million, or 3.9% between years, consistent with higher sales and Gross profit. Further offsetting the decrease in Selling and administrative expenses was an increase in long-term compensation expense and equity compensation expense of $7.2 million during 2014.\nAs a percentage of Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses decreased 120 basis points to 9.2% in 2014, down from 10.4% in 2013. The decrease in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales was largely driven by a decline of 70 basis points in costs related to the IPO in 2013. Sales payroll as a percentage of Net sales also decreased 30 basis points during 2014, reflecting the lower cost to serve transactional sales compared to solutions-focused sales, consistent with our variable compensation cost structure.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of Net sales, and the year-over-year percentage change in Income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 is as follows:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars in\nMillions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\nMargin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars in\nMillions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\nMargin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\nin Income\nfrom Operations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segments: (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>439.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>363.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Headquarters (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(112.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(128.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>673.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>508.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Not meaningful\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Segment income from operations includes the segment's direct operating income and allocations for Headquarters' costs, allocations for income and expenses from logistics services, certain inventory adjustments and volume rebates and cooperative advertising from vendors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Includes certain Headquarters' function costs that are not allocated to the segments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Income from operations was $673.0 million in 2014, an increase of $164.4 million, or 32.3%, compared to $508.6 million in 2013.

Total operating margin percentage increased 90 basis points to 5.6% in 2014, from 4.7% in 2013. Operating margin percentage benefited from the decrease in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, which was driven by the absence of $74.3 million in costs related to our IPO in 2013, and was partially offset by a decrease in Gross profit margin.\nCorporate segment income from operations was $439.8 million in 2014, an increase of $76.5 million, or 21.1%, compared to $363.3 million in 2013. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales and gross profit. Corporate segment operating margin percentage increased 70 basis points to 6.8% in 2014, from 6.1% in 2013. Operating margin percentage benefited from the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, which was driven by the absence of costs related to our IPO in 2013, and was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit margin.\nPublic segment income from operations was $313.2 million in 2014, an increase of $66.7 million, or 27.1%, compared to $246.5 million in 2013. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales and gross profit. Public segment operating margin percentage increased 50 basis points to 6.4% in 2014, from 5.9% in 2013. Operating margin percentage benefited from the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, which was driven by the absence of costs related to our IPO in 2013, and was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit margin.\nInterest expense, net\nAt December 31, 2014, our outstanding long-term debt totaled $3,166.0 million, compared to $3,226.0 million at December 31, 2013. We reduced our long-term debt during 2014 through refinancing activities to redeem our higher interest debt. Net interest expense in 2014 was $197.3 million, a decrease of $52.8 million, compared to $250.1 million in 2013. This decrease was primarily due to lower debt balances and effective interest rates for 2014, compared to 2013 as a result of debt repayments and refinancing activities completed during 2014 and 2013.\nNet loss on extinguishments of long-term debt\nFor information regarding our debt, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2014, we recorded a net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt of $90.7 million compared to $64.0 million in 2013.\nNet loss on extinguishments of long-term debt for the year ended December 31, 2014 is as follows:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Month of Extinguishment\n</td> <td>Debt Instrument\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount Extinguished\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Loss Recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 2014\n</td> <td>2019 Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>541.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 2014\n</td> <td>2019 Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>August 2014\n</td> <td>8.0% Senior Secured Notes due 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>325.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 2014\n</td> <td>Revolving Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 2014\n</td> <td>12.535% Senior Subordinated Exchange Notes due 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 2014\n</td> <td>2019 Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January and February 2014\n</td> <td>12.535% Senior Subordinated Exchange Notes due 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Loss Recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(90.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 2013\n</td> <td>12.535% Senior Subordinated Exchange Notes due 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>August 2013\n</td> <td>12.535% Senior Subordinated Exchange Notes due 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>324.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>July 2013\n</td> <td>8.0% Senior Secured Notes due 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 2013\n</td> <td>Senior Secured Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 2013\n</td> <td>12.535% Senior Subordinated Exchange Notes due 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Loss Recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(64.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>We redeemed or repurchased all or a portion of the aggregate principal amount outstanding.

The effective income tax rate, expressed by calculating income tax expense or benefit as a percentage of income before income taxes, was 36.8% and 32.1% for 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nFor 2014, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, including current year state income tax credits. For 2013, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, including current year state income tax credits and an adjustment to deferred state income taxes due to changes in apportionment factors. The higher effective tax rate for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of changes in state tax apportionment factors had on deferred state income taxes in 2013 and a lower rate impact of state income tax credits due to the increase in income before income taxes in 2014.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations\nWe have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 below. Non-GAAP net income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, non-cash equity-based compensation, and gains and losses from the extinguishment of long-term debt. EBITDA is defined as consolidated Net income before Interest expense, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below. Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by us may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nWe believe that Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Adjusted EBITDA is also the primary measure used in certain key covenants and definitions contained in the credit agreement governing our Term Loan, including the excess cash flow payment provision, the restricted payment covenant and the net leverage ratio. These covenants and definitions are material components of the Term Loan as they are used in determining the interest rate applicable to the Term Loan, our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments. For further details regarding the Term Loan, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-GAAP net income\nNon-GAAP net income was $409.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $95.6 million, or 30.4%, compared to $314.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash equity-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate adjustment for income taxes (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(103.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(113.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>409.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>314.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, customer contracts and trade names.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Includes ($0.6 million) and ($6.3 million) of unusual, non-recurring litigation matters, ($1.1 million) and ($7.5 million) of adjustments to interest expense resulting from debt extinguishments and $1.4 million and $75.0 million of IPO and secondary-offering related expenses in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Based on a normalized effective tax rate of 39.0%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $907.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $98.5 million, or 12.2%, compared to $808.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Additionally, sales in our Public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government and education customers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe finance our operations and capital expenditures with internally generated cash from operations. We also have $843.1 million of availability for borrowings under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility and an additional \u00a350 million ($73.7 million) under the Kelway revolving credit facility. Our liquidity and borrowing plans are established to align with our financial and strategic planning processes and ensure we have the necessary funding to meet our operating commitments, which primarily include the purchase of inventory, payroll and general expenses. We also take into consideration our overall capital allocation strategy which includes investment for future growth, dividend payments, acquisitions and stock repurchases. We believe we have adequate sources of liquidity and funding available for at least the next year, however, there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds. The amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan and general economic conditions.\nLong-Term Debt Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 we had debt refinancings. In connection with these refinancings, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $24.3 million in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring 2015, we repurchased 6.3 million shares of our common stock for $241.3 million under the previously announced $500 million share repurchase program. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Item 5, Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\u201d\nAcquisition\nOn August 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Kelway by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock which increased our ownership interest from 35% to 100% and provided us control. For further details regarding the acquisition, see Note 3 (Acquisition) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDividends\nA summary of 2015 dividend activity for our common stock is as follows:\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Declaration Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Record Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payment Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$0.0675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 10, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 25, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 10, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$0.0675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 7, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 26, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 10, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$0.0675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 3, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 25, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 10, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$0.1075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 4, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 25, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 10, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$0.3100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn February 9, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $0.1075 per share. The dividend will be paid on March 10, 2016 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 25, 2016.\nThe payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, any potential indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law, tax considerations and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us, in each case, under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness.\nCash Flows\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are as follows:\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>277.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>435.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>366.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(354.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(164.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in accounts payable - inventory financing\n</td> <td>95.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other financing activities\n</td> <td>(322.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(187.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(175.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(226.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(112.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(168.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(306.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities are as follows:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>403.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments for the impact of non-cash items(1)\n</td> <td>150.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(81.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income adjusted for the impact of non-cash items(2)\n</td> <td>553.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>476.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in assets and liabilities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable(3)\n</td> <td>(342.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(117.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(225.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merchandise inventory(4)\n</td> <td>(31.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable-trade(5)\n</td> <td>100.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>277.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>435.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(157.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes items such as Deferred income taxes, Depreciation and amortization, Equity-based compensation expense, Gain on remeasurement of equity method investment, Loss (income) from equity method investment and net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>The increase in cash flows reflected stronger operating results driven by organic sales growth and the impact of consolidating five months of Kelway financial results.

The increase in DSO was primarily driven by a higher Accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2015 driven by higher Public segment sales where customers generally take longer to pay than customers in our Corporate segment, slower government payments in certain states due to budget issues and an increase in Net sales and related Accounts receivable for third-party services such as software assurance and warranties. These services have an unfavorable impact on DSO as the receivable is recognized on the balance sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the Statement of Operations is recorded on a net basis. These services have a favorable impact on DPO as the payable is recognized on the balance sheet without a corresponding cost of sale in the Statement of Operations because the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales. In addition to the impact of these services on DPO, DPO also increased due to the mix of payables with certain vendors that have longer payment terms.\nThe cash conversion cycle decreased to 21 days at December 31, 2014 compared to 23 days at December 31, 2013, primarily driven by improvement in DSO. The decline in DSO was primarily driven by improved collections and early payments from certain customers. Additionally, the timing of inventory receipts at the end of 2014 had a favorable impact on DIO and an unfavorable impact on DPO.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $189.6 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to the completion of the acquisition of Kelway by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock on August 1, 2015. Additionally, capital expenditures increased $35.1 million to $90.1 million from $55.0 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily for our new office location and an increase in spending related to improvements to our information technology systems.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $117.7 million in 2014 compared to 2013. We paid $86.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 to acquire a 35% non-controlling interest in Kelway. Additionally, capital expenditures increased $7.9 million to $55.0 million from $47.1 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily for improvements to our information technology systems during both years.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $114.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily driven by share repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2015 which resulted in an increase in cash used for financing activities of $241.3 million. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Item 5, Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\u201d The increase was partially offset by the changes in accounts payable-inventory financing, which resulted in an increase in cash provided for financing activities of $20.4 million, and the net impact of our debt transactions which resulted in cash outflows of $7.1 million and $145.9 million during the years\nended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in cash provided by accounts payable-inventory financing was primarily due to a new vendor added to our previously existing inventory financing agreement. For a description of the inventory financing transactions impacting each period, see Note 6 (Inventory Financing Agreements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. For a description of the debt transactions impacting each period, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $56.3 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily driven by several debt refinancing transactions during each period and our July 2013 IPO, which generated net proceeds of $424.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts, expenses and transaction costs. The net impact of our debt transactions resulted in cash outflows of $145.9 million and $518.3 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively, as cash was used in each period to reduce our total long-term debt. For a description of the debt transactions impacting each period, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLong-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total indebtedness of $3.3 billion, of which $1.6 billion was secured indebtedness. At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the covenants under our various credit agreements and indentures. The amount of CDW's restricted payment capacity under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility was $679.7 million at December 31, 2015.\nFor further details regarding our debt and each of the transactions described below, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the following events occurred with respect to our debt structure:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On August 1, 2015, we consolidated Kelway's Term Loan and Kelway's Revolving Credit Facility.

We generally have been able to pass along price increases to our customers, though certain economic factors and technological advances in recent years have tended to place downward pressure on pricing. We also have been able to generally offset the effects of inflation on operating costs by continuing to emphasize productivity improvements and by accelerating our overall cash conversion cycle. There can be no assurances, however, that inflation would not have a material impact on our sales or operating costs in the future.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe information set forth in Note 14 (Commitments and Contingencies) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. These estimates have not historically required significant management judgment. Our actual results have not differed materially from our estimates, nor have we historically made significant changes to the methods for determining these estimates. We do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and related assumptions will change materially in the foreseeable future however actual results could differ from those estimates.\nIn Note 1 (Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, we include a discussion of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the following are the most critical accounting policies and estimates that include significant judgments used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. We consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time they were made, and if changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe are a primary distribution channel for a large group of vendors and suppliers, including OEMs, software publishers and wholesale distributors. We record revenue from sales transactions when title and risk of loss are passed to our customer, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale, delivery has occurred and/or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Our shipping terms typically specify F.O.B. destination, at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the customer.\nRevenues from the sales of hardware products and software products and licenses are generally recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales. These items can be delivered to customers in a variety of ways, including (i) as physical product shipped from our warehouse, (ii) via drop-shipment by the vendor or supplier, or (iii) via electronic delivery for software licenses. At the time of sale, we record an estimate for sales returns and allowances based on historical experience. Our vendor partners warrant most of the products we sell.\nWe leverage drop-shipment arrangements with many of our vendors and suppliers to deliver products to our customers without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs. We recognize revenue for drop-shipment arrangements on a gross basis upon delivery to the customer with contract terms that typically specify F.O.B. destination. We recognize revenue on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction because we are the primary obligor in the arrangement, we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the customer, we set the price of the product charged to the customer, we assume credit risk for the amounts invoiced, and we work closely with our customers to determine their hardware and software specifications. These arrangements generally represent approximately 45% to 55% of total net sales, including approximately 15% to 20% related to electronic delivery for software licenses.\nRevenue from professional services is either recognized as provided for services billed at an hourly rate, recognized using a percentage of completion model for fixed fee project work or recognized using a proportional performance model for services provided at a fixed fee. Revenue from cloud computing solutions including Software as a Service ( SaaS\u201d) and Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS\u201d) arrangements, as well as data center services such as managed and remote managed services, server co-location, internet connectivity and data backup and storage, is recognized over the period service is provided.\nWe also sell certain products for which we act as an agent. Products in this category include the sale of third-party services, warranties, software assurance ( SA\u201d) and third-party hosted SaaS and IaaS arrangements. SA is a product that allows customers to upgrade, at no additional cost, to the latest technology if new applications are introduced during the period that the SA is in effect. These sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition, and thus are recognized on a net basis at the time of sale. Under net sales recognition, the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales, resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction.\nOur larger customers are offered the opportunity by certain of our vendors to purchase software licenses and SA under enterprise agreements ( EAs\u201d). Under EAs, customers are considered to be compliant with applicable license requirements for the ensuing year, regardless of changes to their employee base. Customers are charged an annual true-up fee for changes in the number of users over the year. With most EAs, our vendors will transfer the license and bill the customer directly, paying resellers such as us an agency fee or commission on these sales. We record these fees as a component of net sales as earned and there is no corresponding cost of sales amount. In certain instances, we bill the customer directly under an EA and account for the individual items sold based on the nature of the item. Our vendors typically dictate how the EA will be sold to the customer.\nWe also sell some of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables, which may include a combination of the products and services. For each deliverable that represents a separate unit of accounting, total arrangement consideration is allocated based upon the relative selling prices of each element. The allocated arrangement consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with the principles described above. Selling prices are determined by using vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) if it exists. Otherwise, selling prices are determined using third party evidence ( TPE\u201d). If neither VSOE or TPE is available, we use our best estimate of selling prices.\nWe record freight billed to our customers as net sales and the related freight costs as a Cost of sales.\nDeferred revenue includes (1) payments received from customers in advance of providing the product or performing services, and (2) amounts deferred if other conditions of revenue recognition have not been met.\nWe perform an analysis of the estimated number of days of sales in-transit to customers at the end of each period based on a weighted-average analysis of commercial delivery terms that includes drop-shipment arrangements. This analysis is the basis upon which we estimate the amount of sales in-transit at the end of the period and adjust revenue and the related costs to reflect only what has been received by the customer. Changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days used in making this adjustment and could have a material impact on our revenue recognition for the period.\nVendor Programs\nWe receive incentives from certain of our vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances, volume rebates, bid programs, price protection and other programs. These incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or inventory, depending on the nature of the incentive. Vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs, which could have an impact on our results of operations.\nWe record receivables from vendors related to these programs when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable. Some programs are based on the achievement of specific targets, and we base our estimates on information provided by our vendors and internal information to assess our progress toward achieving those targets. If actual performance does not match our estimates, we may be required to adjust our receivables. We record reserves for vendor receivables for estimated losses due to vendors' inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims; however, if actual collections differ from our estimates, we may incur additional losses that could have a material impact on gross margin and operating income.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level. We perform an evaluation of goodwill, utilizing either a quantitative or qualitative impairment test, on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The annual test for impairment is conducted as of December 1. Our reporting units used to assess potential goodwill impairment are the same as its operating segments.\nUnder a quantitative assessment, testing for impairment of goodwill is a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to determine the amount of impairment loss. Fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach (75%) and a market approach (25%), as this combination is considered the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants.\nUnder the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of a reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. The estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit are based on internally generated forecasts for the remainder of the respective reporting period and the next six years. We use a 3.5% long-term assumed consolidated annual net sales growth rate for periods after the six-year forecast.\nUnder the market approach, we utilize valuation multiples derived from publicly available information for guideline companies to provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company. The valuation multiples are applied to the reporting units.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including net sales growth rates, gross margins, operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others. Any changes in the judgments, estimates or assumptions used could produce significantly different results.\nUnder a qualitative assessment, the most recent quantitative assessment is the starting point to determine if it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's goodwill is impaired. As part of this qualitative assessment, we assess relevant events and circumstances including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in share price and entity-specific events.\nDecember 1, 2015 Impairment Analysis\nWe completed our annual impairment analysis as of December 1, 2015 by utilizing a qualitative assessment for all reporting units. We determined that it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. As a result of this determination, the quantitative two-step impairment analysis was deemed unnecessary.\nDecember 1, 2014 Impairment Analysis\nWe performed our annual impairment analysis as of December 1, 2014 by utilizing a quantitative assessment for all reporting units. Each reporting unit passed the first step of the analysis, and accordingly, we were not required to perform the second step of the analysis. The estimated fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value. Therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets. Information regarding our 2014 impairment analysis is as follows:\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Percentage\nFair Value\nExceeds\nCarrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Discount Rate\nApplied to\nEstimated Future\nCash Flows\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>169\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>276\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CDW Advanced Services\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets include customer relationships, trade names, internally developed software and other intangibles. Intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The cost of software developed or obtained for internal use is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software. These intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset's carrying amount over its fair value. In addition, each quarter, we evaluate whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each of these intangible assets. If we were to determine that a change to the remaining estimated useful life of an intangible asset was necessary, then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we concluded our intangible assets with determinable lives were not impaired and no significant changes to the remaining useful lives were necessary.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are provided to reflect the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We perform an evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. This evaluation requires us to use estimates and make assumptions and considers all positive and negative evidence and factors, such as the scheduled reversal of temporary differences, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.\nWe account for unrecognized tax benefits based upon our assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe information set forth in Note 2 (Recent Accounting Pronouncements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\nSubsequent Events\nThe information set forth in Note 19 (Subsequent Events) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to comprehend the table you've provided me with.\n- I'm not sure what kind of response you're looking for with this input, could you clarify what it is you'd like me to do with this table?\n- I'm sorry, I am unable to understand this prompt.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nUnless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d the terms we,\u201d us,\u201d the Company,\u201d our,\u201d CDW\u201d and similar terms refer to CDW Corporation and its subsidiaries. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above.\nOverview\nCDW is a Fortune 500 company and a leading provider of integrated information technology ( IT\u201d) solutions in North America and the United Kingdom. We help our customer base of over 250,000 small, medium and large business, government, education and healthcare customers by delivering critical solutions to their increasingly complex IT needs. Our broad array of offerings ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated IT solutions such as mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization and collaboration. We are technology agnostic,\u201d with a product portfolio including more than 100,000 products from more than 1,000 brands. We provide our products and solutions through more than 5,000 customer-facing coworkers, including field sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers.\nWe are a leading sales channel partner in North America and the United Kingdom for many original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d) and software publishers (collectively, our vendor partners\u201d), whose products we sell or include in the solutions we offer. We believe we are an important extension of our vendor partners' sales and marketing capabilities, providing them with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our established end-market coverage and extensive customer access.\nOn August 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Kelway TopCo Limited ( Kelway\u201d) by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock which increased our ownership interest from 35% to 100%, and provided us control. Kelway is a U.K.-based IT solutions provider, which has global supply chain relationships that enable it to conduct business in more than 80 countries. This investment strengthens our ability to provide a more comprehensive solution to our customers and enhances our ability to serve our existing multi-national customers. We included the financial results of Kelway in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. For additional information relating to the acquisition, see Note 3 (Acquisition) to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe have two reportable segments: Corporate, which is comprised primarily of private sector business customers in the U.S., and Public, which is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions in the U.S. Our Corporate segment is divided into a medium/large business customer channel, primarily serving customers with more than 100 employees, and a small business customer channel, primarily serving customers with up to 100 employees. We also have three other operating segments: CDW Advanced Services; Canada; and Kelway, each of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are included in an all other category ( Other\u201d). For additional information relating to Kelway, see Note 3 (Acquisition) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. The CDW Advanced Services business consists primarily of customized engineering services delivered by technology specialists and engineers, and managed services that include Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS\u201d) offerings. Effective January 1, 2016, the CDW Advanced Services business will be included in our Corporate and Public segments and Other will be comprised of Canada and Kelway. Revenues in the U.S. from the sale of hardware, software, custom configuration and third-party provided services are recorded within our Corporate and Public segments.\nWe may sell all or only select products that our vendor partners offer. Each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions, which may include one or more of the following: product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs, such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements. We also resell software for major software publishers. Our agreements with software publishers allow the end-user customer to acquire software or licensed products and services. In addition to helping our customers determine the best software solutions for their needs, we help them manage their software agreements, including warranties and renewals. A significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses is reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs with our vendor partners. These programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are typically tied to sales or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time.\nTrends and Key Factors Affecting our Financial Performance\nWe believe the following trends may have an important impact on our financial performance:\n \u2022 Our Public segment sales are impacted by government spending policies, budget priorities and revenue levels. An adverse change in any of these factors could cause our Public segment customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew contracts with us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2015, sales to federal customers increased year-over-year in the mid-teens as we continued to benefit from strategic changes made to better align with new federal government purchasing programs implemented last year. During the same period, sales to state and local customers also increased year-over-year in the mid-teens, driven by the continued focus on public safety. Meeting K-12 customer digital curriculum testing needs through sales of client devices was a significant contributor to education sales throughout 2014 and into early 2015. Education sales decreased slightly in 2015 as a decline in K-12 client device sales was partially offset by an increase in netcomm sales. In 2015, we were named as provider on both the largest number of applications and the largest dollar amounts requested for funds by K-12 customers to support internal connections for the 2014-2015 program year of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission E-Rate program. The amount and timing of E-Rate funds approval and customer implementation is not certain. \n \u2022 An important factor affecting our ability to generate sales and achieve our targeted operating results is the impact of general economic conditions on our customers' willingness to spend on information technology. During the year ended December 31, 2015, global economic signals were mixed. We continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions. Uncertainties related to potential changes in tax and regulatory policy, potential interest rate increases, weakening consumer and business confidence or increased unemployment could result in reduced or deferred spending on information technology products and services by our customers and result in increased competitive pricing pressures. \n \u2022 We believe that our customers' transition to more complex technology solutions will continue to be an important growth area for us in the future. However, because the market for technology products and services is highly competitive, our success at capitalizing on this transition will be based on our ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, the quality and breadth of our product and service offerings, the knowledge and expertise of our sales force, price, product availability and speed of delivery. During the year ended December 31, 2015, customer priorities continued to shift away from last year's focus on client devices towards more integrated solutions, which grew substantially faster than transactional sales.  Key Business Metrics\nOur management monitors a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary. We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, Net income, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per common share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, return on invested capital, Cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in Accounts receivable plus days of supply in Inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in Accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios, sales per coworker, and coworker turnover. These measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.\nNon-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these measures provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Adjusted EBITDA also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain key covenants and definitions contained in the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (the Term Loan\u201d), including the excess cash flow payment provision, the restricted payment covenant and the net leverage ratio. These covenants and definitions are material components of the Term Loan as they are used in determining the interest rate applicable to the Term Loan, our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt, and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments. For further details regarding the Term Loan, see Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. For the definitions of Non-GAAP net income and Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliations to Net income, see Results of Operations\u201d.\nThe results of certain key business metrics are as follows:\n\n (1) As a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-03 during the second quarter of 2015, historical periods have been revised to reflect the change in the presentation of deferred financing costs, which are now shown as a reduction of Long-term debt, instead of being presented as a separate asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the third quarter of 2015, we adopted ASU 2015-15 which allows entities to present deferred financing costs for line-of-credit arrangements as an asset. We retroactively adjusted the deferred financing costs and Long-term debt liability presented in historical periods to align it to the current period presentation. \n (2) Cash conversion cycle is defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average.  Results of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nResults of operations, in dollars and as a percentage of Net sales, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\n\n (1) Percentages may not total due to rounding. \nNet sales\nNet sales by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of total Net sales, and the year-over-year dollar and percentage change in Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\n\n (1) There were 254 selling days for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  Total Net sales in 2015 increased $914.2 million, or 7.6%, to $12,988.7 million, compared to $12,074.5 million in 2014, reflecting both organic net sales growth and the impact of consolidating five months of Kelway net sales. Customer priorities continued to shift more towards integrated solutions, which drove higher growth in solutions sales compared to transactional product sales. Strong sales performance in solutions-focused products was driven by netcomm and server and server-related products. The growth in transactional products was led by notebooks/mobile devices, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers.\nOrganic net sales, which excludes the impact of the acquisition of Kelway, increased $563.5 million, or 4.7%, to $12,638.0 million in 2015, compared to $12,074.5 million in 2014. Organic net sales on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, in 2015 increased $635.0 million, or 5.3%, to $12,638.0 million, compared to $12,003.0 million in 2014. For additional information, see Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations\u201d below.\nCorporate segment net sales in 2015 increased $340.9 million, or 5.3%, compared to 2014, driven by sales growth in both our medium/large and small business customer channels and reflecting stronger performance in solutions sales compared to transactional product sales. Within our Corporate segment, net sales to medium/large customers increased $272.8 million, or 5.0%, year over year, primarily due to strong sales performance in solutions-focused products driven by netcomm products and server and server-related products. Growth in transactional products was driven by notebook/mobile devices, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers. Net sales to small business customers increased by $68.1 million, or 6.9%, between periods, driven by growth in notebooks/mobile devices and netcomm products, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers.\nPublic segment net sales in 2015 increased $246.1 million, or 5.0%, between years, due to strong sales performance in government and growth in healthcare, partially offset by education remaining relatively flat. Net sales to government customers increased $226.5 million, or 15.6%, between periods, as sales to both federal and state/local government customers experienced mid-teens growth. The increase in net sales to the federal government was driven by growth in sales of netcomm products, software and enterprise storage, as we continued to benefit from strategic changes made to better align with new federal government purchasing programs implemented last year. A continued focus on public safety drove the increase in net sales to state/local government customers, which was led by netcomm products, notebooks/mobile devices and software, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers. Net sales to education customers decreased $17.0 million, or 0.9%, year over year, primarily due to declines in notebooks/mobile devices, partially offset by growth in netcomm products. Net sales to healthcare customers increased $36.6 million, or 2.3%, year over year, driven by growth in netcomm and server-related products, partially offset by declines in desktop\ncomputers and point-of-care technology carts, as some of our larger customers shifted priorities to reducing costs due to industry consolidation.\nNet sales in Other in 2015 increased $327.2 million, or 45.5%, compared 2014. Other is comprised of CDW Advanced Services, Canada and Kelway. The increase in net sales was driven by the impact of consolidating five months of Kelway net sales, as well as growth in CDW Advanced Services, partially offset by a decline in the U.S. dollar-denominated net sales of Canada. The net sales of Canada in constant currency continued to grow during 2015 compared to 2014.\nGross profit\nGross profit increased $194.5 million, or 10.1%, to $2,115.8 million in 2015, compared to $1,921.3 million in 2014. As a percentage of net sales, Gross profit increased 40 basis points to 16.3% in 2015, from 15.9% in 2014.\nNet service contract revenue, including items such as third-party services, warranties and SaaS contributed a positive impact of 15 basis points to gross profit margin as our cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales, resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction. Gross profit margin was positively impacted 15 basis points due to a higher mix of services and improved product margin. We also experienced a favorable impact of 10 basis points from vendor partner funding. Vendor partner funding includes purchase discounts, volume rebates and cooperative advertising.\nGross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors, including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs, cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales, product mix, net service contract revenue, commission revenue, pricing strategies, market conditions and other factors.\nSelling and administrative expenses\nSelling and administrative expenses increased $115.7 million, or 10.4%, to $1,226.0 million in 2015, compared to $1,110.3 million in 2014. As a percentage of total Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses increased 20 basis points to 9.4% in 2015, up from 9.2% in 2014. Sales payroll costs increased $60.1 million, or 12.0%, year over year, primarily due to increased sales compensation consistent with growth in solutions-related sales, an increase in Gross profit and consolidating five months of incremental Kelway sales payroll costs. In addition, certain coworker costs increased $9.5 million, or 3.8%, during 2015 compared to the prior year, due to higher costs consistent with increased coworker count, primarily due to our acquisition of Kelway. Total coworker count was 8,465 at December 31, 2015, up 1,254 from 7,211 at December 31, 2014. Amortization expense related to intangibles increased $16.7 million, or 9.2%, during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to incremental amortization expense related to the intangible assets arising from our acquisition of Kelway. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense increased $14.8 million, or 90.7%, during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to annual equity awards granted under our 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2015, performance against long-term incentive program targets and equity awards granted in connection with our acquisition of Kelway. In addition, we incurred $10.2 million of acquisition and integration costs in 2015 related to our acquisition of Kelway.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of Net sales, and the year-over-year percentage change for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:\n\n* Not meaningful\n (1) Segment income from operations includes the segment's direct operating income, allocations for Headquarters' costs, allocations for income and expenses from logistics services, certain inventory adjustments and volume rebates and cooperative advertising from vendors. \n (2) Includes the financial results for our other operating segments, CDW Advanced Services, Canada and five months for Kelway, which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds. \n (3) Includes certain Headquarters' function costs that are not allocated to the segments.  Income from operations was $742.0 million in 2015, an increase of $69.0 million, or 10.3%, compared to $673.0 million in 2014. Total operating margin increased 10 basis points to 5.7% in 2015, from 5.6% in 2014. Operating margin was positively impacted by the increase in gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales. This increase was driven by higher Net sales and Gross profit.\nCorporate segment income from operations was $470.1 million in 2015, an increase of $30.3 million, or 6.9%, compared to $439.8 million in 2014. Corporate segment operating margin increased 10 basis points to 6.9% in 2015, from 6.8% in 2014. This increase was driven by higher net sales and gross profit.\nPublic segment income from operations was $343.3 million in 2015, an increase of $30.1 million, or 9.6%, compared to $313.2 million in 2015. Public segment operating margin increased 30 basis points to 6.7% in 2015, from 6.4% in 2014. This increase was driven by higher net sales and gross profit.\nInterest expense, net\nAt December 31, 2015, our outstanding long-term debt totaled $3,259.7 million, compared to $3,166.0 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $93.7 million primarily due to the completion of the acquisition of Kelway. Net interest expense in 2015 was $159.5 million, a decrease of $37.8 million, compared to $197.3 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to lower effective interest rates for 2015, compared to 2014 as a result of redemptions and refinancing activities completed during 2014 and 2015.\nNet loss on extinguishments of long-term debt\nFor information regarding our debt, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2015, we recorded a net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt of $24.3 million compared to $90.7 million in 2014.\nNet loss on extinguishments of long-term debt for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\n\n (1) We redeemed or repurchased all of or a portion of the remaining aggregate principal amount outstanding. The loss recognized represents the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt, adjusted for the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs and/or premium. \n (2) We entered into the Revolving Loan, a new $1,250 million five-year senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility. The Revolving Loan replaced our previous revolving loan credit facility that was to mature on June 24, 2016. The loss recognized represents the write-off of a portion of unamortized deferred financing costs.  Gain on remeasurement of equity investment\nOn August 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Kelway by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock which increased our ownership interest from 35% to 100%, and provided us control. As a result, our previously held 35% equity investment was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of $98.1 million recorded in Gain on remeasurement of equity investment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense was $243.9 million in 2015, compared to $142.8 million in 2014. The effective income tax rate, expressed by calculating income tax expense or benefit as a percentage of income before income taxes, was 37.7% and 36.8% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFor 2015, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and withholding tax expense on the earnings of our Canadian business as a result of no longer asserting permanent reinvestment which was partially offset by a deferred tax benefit as a result of a tax rate reduction in the U.K. For 2014, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, including current year state income tax credits. The higher effective tax rate for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to higher state income taxes due to lower state income tax credits and the aforementioned Canadian withholding tax expense partially offset by the deferred tax benefit reflecting the tax rate reduction in the U.K. We are asserting that the unremitted earnings of our U.K. business are indefinitely reinvested.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations\nWe have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Organic net sales growth and Organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 below. Non-GAAP net income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, non-cash equity-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses and gains and losses from the extinguishment of long-term debt. EBITDA is defined as consolidated Net income before interest expense, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below. Organic net sales growth is calculated as net sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions recorded within the last twelve months. Organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis is calculated as organic net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on organic net sales compared to the prior period. Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Organic net sales growth and Organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by us may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nWe believe that Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Organic net sales growth and Organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Adjusted EBITDA is also the primary measure used in certain key covenants and definitions contained in the credit agreement governing our Term Loan, including the excess cash flow payment provision, the restricted payment covenant and the net leverage ratio. These covenants and definitions are material components of the Term Loan as they are used in determining the interest rate applicable to the Term Loan, our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments. For further details regarding the Term Loan, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-GAAP net income\nNon-GAAP net income was $503.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $93.6 million, or 22.8%, compared to $409.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\n (1) Includes amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, customer contracts and trade names. \n (2) Represents our 35% share of an expense related to certain equity awards granted by one of the sellers to Kelway coworkers in July 2015 prior to our acquisition of Kelway. \n (3) Primarily includes expenses related to the acquisition of Kelway. \n (4) Represents the gain resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held 35% equity investment to fair value upon the completion of the acquisition of Kelway. \n (5) Primarily includes expenses related to the consolidation of office locations north of Chicago and secondary-offering-related expenses. \n (6) Based on a normalized effective tax rate of 38.0% (39.0% prior to the Kelway acquisition), except for the non-cash equity-based compensation from our equity investment and the gain resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held 35% equity investment to fair value upon the completion of the acquisition of Kelway, which were tax effected at a rate of 35.4%. The aggregate adjustment for income taxes also includes a $4.0 million deferred tax benefit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of a tax rate reduction in the United Kingdom and additional tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 of $3.3 million as a result of recording withholding tax on the unremitted earnings of our Canadian subsidiary. Additionally, note that certain acquisition costs are non-deductible. \n (7) Includes the impact of consolidating five months for the year ended December 31, 2015 of Kelway's financial results.  Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $1,018.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $111.5 million, or 12.3%, compared to $907.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. As a percentage of Net sales, Adjusted EBITDA was 7.8% and 7.5% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\n (1) Represents our share of net (income) loss from our equity investments. Our share of Kelway's net loss includes our 35% share of an expense related to certain equity awards granted by one of the sellers to Kelway coworkers in July 2015 prior to the acquisition. \n (2) Primarily includes expenses related to the acquisition of Kelway. \n (3) Represents the gain resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held 35% equity investment to fair value upon the completion of the acquisition of Kelway. \n (4) Primarily includes certain historical retention costs, unusual, non-recurring litigation matters, secondary-offering-related expenses and expenses related to the consolidation of office locations north of Chicago. \n (5) Includes the impact of consolidating five months for the year ended December 31, 2015 of Kelway's financial results.  Organic net sales growth and organic net sales growth on constant currency basis\nOrganic net sales, which excludes the impact of the acquisition of Kelway, increased $563.5 million, or 4.7%, to $12,638.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $12,074.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Organic net sales on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $635.0 million, or 5.3%, to $12,638.0 million, compared to $12,003.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\n (1) Represents five months for the year ended December 31, 2015 of Kelway's financial results. \n (2) Represents the effect of translating the prior year results of our Canadian subsidiary at the average exchange rates applicable in the current year. \nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nResults of operations, in dollars and as a percentage of net sales, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:\n\nNet sales\nNet sales by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of total Net sales, and the year-over-year dollar and percentage change in Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:\n\n (1) There were 254 selling days for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.  Total Net sales in 2014 increased $1,305.9 million, or 12.1%, to $12,074.5 million, compared to $10,768.6 million in 2013. The increase in total Net sales was primarily the result of continued growth in transactional products driven by notebooks/mobile devices and desktop computers, as customers across all channels refreshed their client devices and K-12 customers continued to prepare for digital testing requirements, and the addition of more than 140 customer-facing coworkers, the majority in pre- and post-sale technical positions such as technical specialists and service delivery roles. Growth in solutions-focused products, including netcomm and software, also contributed to the increase in Net sales during 2014.\nCorporate segment net sales in 2014 increased $515.4 million, or 8.6%, compared to 2013, driven by sales growth in the medium/large customer channel. Within our Corporate segment, net sales to medium/large customers increased $432.7 million, or 8.6%, year over year, primarily due to customers refreshing their client devices and making continued investments in technology infrastructure and a continued focus on seller productivity. This increase was led by growth in notebooks/mobile devices, netcomm products, software, and desktop computers. Net sales to small business customers increased $82.7 million, or 9.1%, year over year, driven by growth in notebooks/mobile devices and desktop computers due to customers refreshing their client devices.\nPublic segment net sales in 2014 increased $714.9 million, or 17.2%, year over year, driven by strong performance across all channels. In 2013, and through the second quarter of 2014, Public segment results were impacted by the combined and residual negative effects of sequestration, the partial shutdown of the federal government in 2013 and federal government budget uncertainty. However, with the finalization of federal budget allocations in early 2014, we began to see improvement in federal sales in the second quarter of 2014 and saw continued momentum through the third quarter of 2014 in conjunction with the federal fiscal year-end. This recovery continued into the fourth quarter of 2014 in connection with increased customer confidence that a federal budget for 2015 would be in place. Net sales to government customers increased $198.8 million, or 15.9%. The increase in net sales to the federal government was led by increases in sales of notebooks/mobile devices and desktop computers. The increase in net sales to state/local government customers was led by growth in sales of notebooks/mobile devices, netcomm products, enterprise storage, and software due to a continued focus on public safety solutions. Net sales to education customers increased $375.0 million, or 25.9%, year over year, led by growth in net sales to K-12 customers, reflecting increased sales of notebooks/mobile devices to support digital testing requirements. Net sales to healthcare customers increased $141.1 million, or 9.6%, between periods, driven by growth in netcomm products, notebook/mobile devices, and desktop computers.\nGross profit\nGross profit increased $161.0 million, or 9.1%, to $1,921.3 million in 2014, compared to $1,760.3 million in 2013. As a percentage of Net sales, Gross profit decreased 40 basis points to 15.9% during 2014, down from 16.3% in 2013. Gross profit margin was negatively impacted 30 basis points by unfavorable price/mix changes within product margin, as transactional product categories such as notebooks/mobile devices and desktops experienced a higher rate of net sales growth than our overall net sales growth, accompanied by continuing product margin compression in these product categories. Additionally, we experienced an unfavorable impact of 10 basis points from vendor funding in 2014. Although vendor funding dollars increased, it represented a lower percentage of Net sales in 2014 compared to 2013. Vendor funding includes purchase discounts, volume rebates and cooperative advertising.\nGross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors, including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs, cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales, product mix, net service contract revenue, commission revenue, pricing strategies, market conditions and other factors.\nSelling and administrative expenses\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased $10.6 million, or 0.9%, to $1,110.3 million in 2014, compared to $1,120.9 million in 2013. The overall decrease was largely driven by the absence of $74.3 million in costs incurred during 2013 related to the completion of our IPO. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $31.4 million, or 14.3%, of certain coworker costs between years which was primarily due to higher compensation consistent with increased coworker count and attainment-based compensation accruals tied to annual performance. Total coworker count was 7,211, up 244 from 6,967 at December 31, 2013. In addition, sales payroll, including sales commissions and other variable compensation costs, increased $18.6 million, or 3.9% between years, consistent with higher sales and Gross profit. Further offsetting the decrease in Selling and administrative expenses was an increase in long-term compensation expense and equity compensation expense of $7.2 million during 2014.\nAs a percentage of Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses decreased 120 basis points to 9.2% in 2014, down from 10.4% in 2013. The decrease in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales was largely driven by a decline of 70 basis points in costs related to the IPO in 2013. Sales payroll as a percentage of Net sales also decreased 30 basis points during 2014, reflecting the lower cost to serve transactional sales compared to solutions-focused sales, consistent with our variable compensation cost structure.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of Net sales, and the year-over-year percentage change in Income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 is as follows:\n\n* Not meaningful\n (1) Segment income from operations includes the segment's direct operating income and allocations for Headquarters' costs, allocations for income and expenses from logistics services, certain inventory adjustments and volume rebates and cooperative advertising from vendors. \n (2) Includes certain Headquarters' function costs that are not allocated to the segments.  Income from operations was $673.0 million in 2014, an increase of $164.4 million, or 32.3%, compared to $508.6 million in 2013. The increase in Income from operations was driven by higher Net sales and Gross profit and the absence of IPO-related costs. Total operating margin percentage increased 90 basis points to 5.6% in 2014, from 4.7% in 2013. Operating margin percentage benefited from the decrease in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, which was driven by the absence of $74.3 million in costs related to our IPO in 2013, and was partially offset by a decrease in Gross profit margin.\nCorporate segment income from operations was $439.8 million in 2014, an increase of $76.5 million, or 21.1%, compared to $363.3 million in 2013. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales and gross profit. Corporate segment operating margin percentage increased 70 basis points to 6.8% in 2014, from 6.1% in 2013. Operating margin percentage benefited from the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, which was driven by the absence of costs related to our IPO in 2013, and was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit margin.\nPublic segment income from operations was $313.2 million in 2014, an increase of $66.7 million, or 27.1%, compared to $246.5 million in 2013. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales and gross profit. Public segment operating margin percentage increased 50 basis points to 6.4% in 2014, from 5.9% in 2013. Operating margin percentage benefited from the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, which was driven by the absence of costs related to our IPO in 2013, and was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit margin.\nInterest expense, net\nAt December 31, 2014, our outstanding long-term debt totaled $3,166.0 million, compared to $3,226.0 million at December 31, 2013. We reduced our long-term debt during 2014 through refinancing activities to redeem our higher interest debt. Net interest expense in 2014 was $197.3 million, a decrease of $52.8 million, compared to $250.1 million in 2013. This decrease was primarily due to lower debt balances and effective interest rates for 2014, compared to 2013 as a result of debt repayments and refinancing activities completed during 2014 and 2013.\nNet loss on extinguishments of long-term debt\nFor information regarding our debt, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2014, we recorded a net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt of $90.7 million compared to $64.0 million in 2013.\nNet loss on extinguishments of long-term debt for the year ended December 31, 2014 is as follows:\n\n (1) We redeemed or repurchased all or a portion of the aggregate principal amount outstanding. The loss recognized represents the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt, adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs and/or unamortized premium. \n (2) We entered into the Revolving Loan, a new $1,250 million five-year senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility. The Revolving Loan replaced our previous revolving loan credit facility that was to mature on June 24, 2016. The loss recognized represents the write-off of a portion of unamortized deferred financing costs. \n (3) We entered into the Term Loan, a new $1,350 million seven-year Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. Substantially all of the proceeds were used to repay the $1,299.5 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the prior senior secured term loan facility. The loss recognized represents the write-off of a portion of unamortized deferred financing costs.  Income tax expense\nIncome tax expense was $142.8 million in 2014, compared to $62.7 million in 2013. The effective income tax rate, expressed by calculating income tax expense or benefit as a percentage of income before income taxes, was 36.8% and 32.1% for 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nFor 2014, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, including current year state income tax credits. For 2013, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, including current year state income tax credits and an adjustment to deferred state income taxes due to changes in apportionment factors. The higher effective tax rate for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of changes in state tax apportionment factors had on deferred state income taxes in 2013 and a lower rate impact of state income tax credits due to the increase in income before income taxes in 2014.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations\nWe have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 below. Non-GAAP net income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, non-cash equity-based compensation, and gains and losses from the extinguishment of long-term debt. EBITDA is defined as consolidated Net income before Interest expense, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below. Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by us may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nWe believe that Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Adjusted EBITDA is also the primary measure used in certain key covenants and definitions contained in the credit agreement governing our Term Loan, including the excess cash flow payment provision, the restricted payment covenant and the net leverage ratio. These covenants and definitions are material components of the Term Loan as they are used in determining the interest rate applicable to the Term Loan, our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments. For further details regarding the Term Loan, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-GAAP net income\nNon-GAAP net income was $409.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $95.6 million, or 30.4%, compared to $314.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\n\n (1) Includes amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, customer contracts and trade names. \n (2) Includes ($0.6 million) and ($6.3 million) of unusual, non-recurring litigation matters, ($1.1 million) and ($7.5 million) of adjustments to interest expense resulting from debt extinguishments and $1.4 million and $75.0 million of IPO and secondary-offering related expenses in 2014 and 2013, respectively. \n (3) Based on a normalized effective tax rate of 39.0%.  Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $907.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $98.5 million, or 12.2%, compared to $808.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. As a percentage of Net sales, Adjusted EBITDA was 7.5% for both the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nUnless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d the terms we,\u201d us,\u201d the Company,\u201d our,\u201d CDW\u201d and similar terms refer to CDW Corporation and its subsidiaries. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above.\nOverview\nCDW is a Fortune 500 company and a leading provider of integrated information technology ( IT\u201d) solutions in North America and the United Kingdom. We help our customer base of over 250,000 small, medium and large business, government, education and healthcare customers by delivering critical solutions to their increasingly complex IT needs. Our broad array of offerings ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated IT solutions such as mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization and collaboration. We are technology agnostic,\u201d with a product portfolio including more than 100,000 products from more than 1,000 brands. We provide our products and solutions through more than 5,000 customer-facing coworkers, including field sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers.\nWe are a leading sales channel partner in North America and the United Kingdom for many original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d) and software publishers (collectively, our vendor partners\u201d), whose products we sell or include in the solutions we offer. We believe we are an important extension of our vendor partners' sales and marketing capabilities, providing them with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our established end-market coverage and extensive customer access.\nOn August 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Kelway TopCo Limited ( Kelway\u201d) by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock which increased our ownership interest from 35% to 100%, and provided us control. Kelway is a U.K.-based IT solutions provider, which has global supply chain relationships that enable it to conduct business in more than 80 countries. This investment strengthens our ability to provide a more comprehensive solution to our customers and enhances our ability to serve our existing multi-national customers. We included the financial results of Kelway in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. For additional information relating to the acquisition, see Note 3 (Acquisition) to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe have two reportable segments: Corporate, which is comprised primarily of private sector business customers in the U.S., and Public, which is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions in the U.S. Our Corporate segment is divided into a medium/large business customer channel, primarily serving customers with more than 100 employees, and a small business customer channel, primarily serving customers with up to 100 employees. We also have three other operating segments: CDW Advanced Services; Canada; and Kelway, each of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are included in an all other category ( Other\u201d). For additional information relating to Kelway, see Note 3 (Acquisition) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. The CDW Advanced Services business consists primarily of customized engineering services delivered by technology specialists and engineers, and managed services that include Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS\u201d) offerings. Effective January 1, 2016, the CDW Advanced Services business will be included in our Corporate and Public segments and Other will be comprised of Canada and Kelway. Revenues in the U.S. from the sale of hardware, software, custom configuration and third-party provided services are recorded within our Corporate and Public segments.\nWe may sell all or only select products that our vendor partners offer. Each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions, which may include one or more of the following: product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs, such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements. We also resell software for major software publishers. Our agreements with software publishers allow the end-user customer to acquire software or licensed products and services. In addition to helping our customers determine the best software solutions for their needs, we help them manage their software agreements, including warranties and renewals. A significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses is reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs with our vendor partners. These programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are typically tied to sales or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time.\nTrends and Key Factors Affecting our Financial Performance\nWe believe the following trends may have an important impact on our financial performance:\n \u2022 Our Public segment sales are impacted by government spending policies, budget priorities and revenue levels. An adverse change in any of these factors could cause our Public segment customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew contracts with us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2015, sales to federal customers increased year-over-year in the mid-teens as we continued to benefit from strategic changes made to better align with new federal government purchasing programs implemented last year. During the same period, sales to state and local customers also increased year-over-year in the mid-teens, driven by the continued focus on public safety. Meeting K-12 customer digital curriculum testing needs through sales of client devices was a significant contributor to education sales throughout 2014 and into early 2015. Education sales decreased slightly in 2015 as a decline in K-12 client device sales was partially offset by an increase in netcomm sales. In 2015, we were named as provider on both the largest number of applications and the largest dollar amounts requested for funds by K-12 customers to support internal connections for the 2014-2015 program year of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission E-Rate program. The amount and timing of E-Rate funds approval and customer implementation is not certain. \n \u2022 An important factor affecting our ability to generate sales and achieve our targeted operating results is the impact of general economic conditions on our customers' willingness to spend on information technology. During the year ended December 31, 2015, global economic signals were mixed. We continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions. Uncertainties related to potential changes in tax and regulatory policy, potential interest rate increases, weakening consumer and business confidence or increased unemployment could result in reduced or deferred spending on information technology products and services by our customers and result in increased competitive pricing pressures. \n \u2022 We believe that our customers' transition to more complex technology solutions will continue to be an important growth area for us in the future. However, because the market for technology products and services is highly competitive, our success at capitalizing on this transition will be based on our ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, the quality and breadth of our product and service offerings, the knowledge and expertise of our sales force, price, product availability and speed of delivery. During the year ended December 31, 2015, customer priorities continued to shift away from last year's focus on client devices towards more integrated solutions, which grew substantially faster than transactional sales.  Key Business Metrics\nOur management monitors a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary. We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, Net income, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per common share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, return on invested capital, Cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in Accounts receivable plus days of supply in Inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in Accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios, sales per coworker, and coworker turnover. These measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.\nNon-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these measures provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Adjusted EBITDA also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain key covenants and definitions contained in the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (the Term Loan\u201d), including the excess cash flow payment provision, the restricted payment covenant and the net leverage ratio. These covenants and definitions are material components of the Term Loan as they are used in determining the interest rate applicable to the Term Loan, our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt, and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments. For further details regarding the Term Loan, see Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the third quarter of 2015, we adopted ASU 2015-15 which allows entities to present deferred financing costs for line-of-credit arrangements as an asset. We retroactively adjusted the deferred financing costs and Long-term debt liability presented in historical periods to align it to the current period presentation. \n (2) Cash conversion cycle is defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average.

(1) There were 254 selling days for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  Total Net sales in 2015 increased $914.2 million, or 7.6%, to $12,988.7 million, compared to $12,074.5 million in 2014, reflecting both organic net sales growth and the impact of consolidating five months of Kelway net sales. Customer priorities continued to shift more towards integrated solutions, which drove higher growth in solutions sales compared to transactional product sales. Strong sales performance in solutions-focused products was driven by netcomm and server and server-related products. The growth in transactional products was led by notebooks/mobile devices, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers.\nOrganic net sales, which excludes the impact of the acquisition of Kelway, increased $563.5 million, or 4.7%, to $12,638.0 million in 2015, compared to $12,074.5 million in 2014. Organic net sales on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, in 2015 increased $635.0 million, or 5.3%, to $12,638.0 million, compared to $12,003.0 million in 2014. For additional information, see Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations\u201d below.\nCorporate segment net sales in 2015 increased $340.9 million, or 5.3%, compared to 2014, driven by sales growth in both our medium/large and small business customer channels and reflecting stronger performance in solutions sales compared to transactional product sales. Within our Corporate segment, net sales to medium/large customers increased $272.8 million, or 5.0%, year over year, primarily due to strong sales performance in solutions-focused products driven by netcomm products and server and server-related products. Growth in transactional products was driven by notebook/mobile devices, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers. Net sales to small business customers increased by $68.1 million, or 6.9%, between periods, driven by growth in notebooks/mobile devices and netcomm products, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers.\nPublic segment net sales in 2015 increased $246.1 million, or 5.0%, between years, due to strong sales performance in government and growth in healthcare, partially offset by education remaining relatively flat. Net sales to government customers increased $226.5 million, or 15.6%, between periods, as sales to both federal and state/local government customers experienced mid-teens growth. The increase in net sales to the federal government was driven by growth in sales of netcomm products, software and enterprise storage, as we continued to benefit from strategic changes made to better align with new federal government purchasing programs implemented last year. A continued focus on public safety drove the increase in net sales to state/local government customers, which was led by netcomm products, notebooks/mobile devices and software, partially offset by a decline in desktop computers. Net sales to education customers decreased $17.0 million, or 0.9%, year over year, primarily due to declines in notebooks/mobile devices, partially offset by growth in netcomm products. Net sales to healthcare customers increased $36.6 million, or 2.3%, year over year, driven by growth in netcomm and server-related products, partially offset by declines in desktop\ncomputers and point-of-care technology carts, as some of our larger customers shifted priorities to reducing costs due to industry consolidation.\nNet sales in Other in 2015 increased $327.2 million, or 45.5%, compared 2014. Other is comprised of CDW Advanced Services, Canada and Kelway. The increase in net sales was driven by the impact of consolidating five months of Kelway net sales, as well as growth in CDW Advanced Services, partially offset by a decline in the U.S. dollar-denominated net sales of Canada. The net sales of Canada in constant currency continued to grow during 2015 compared to 2014.\nGross profit\nGross profit increased $194.5 million, or 10.1%, to $2,115.8 million in 2015, compared to $1,921.3 million in 2014. As a percentage of net sales, Gross profit increased 40 basis points to 16.3% in 2015, from 15.9% in 2014.\nNet service contract revenue, including items such as third-party services, warranties and SaaS contributed a positive impact of 15 basis points to gross profit margin as our cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales, resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction. Gross profit margin was positively impacted 15 basis points due to a higher mix of services and improved product margin. We also experienced a favorable impact of 10 basis points from vendor partner funding. Vendor partner funding includes purchase discounts, volume rebates and cooperative advertising.\nGross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors, including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs, cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales, product mix, net service contract revenue, commission revenue, pricing strategies, market conditions and other factors.\nSelling and administrative expenses\nSelling and administrative expenses increased $115.7 million, or 10.4%, to $1,226.0 million in 2015, compared to $1,110.3 million in 2014. As a percentage of total Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses increased 20 basis points to 9.4% in 2015, up from 9.2% in 2014. Sales payroll costs increased $60.1 million, or 12.0%, year over year, primarily due to increased sales compensation consistent with growth in solutions-related sales, an increase in Gross profit and consolidating five months of incremental Kelway sales payroll costs. In addition, certain coworker costs increased $9.5 million, or 3.8%, during 2015 compared to the prior year, due to higher costs consistent with increased coworker count, primarily due to our acquisition of Kelway. Total coworker count was 8,465 at December 31, 2015, up 1,254 from 7,211 at December 31, 2014. Amortization expense related to intangibles increased $16.7 million, or 9.2%, during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to incremental amortization expense related to the intangible assets arising from our acquisition of Kelway. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense increased $14.8 million, or 90.7%, during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to annual equity awards granted under our 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2015, performance against long-term incentive program targets and equity awards granted in connection with our acquisition of Kelway. In addition, we incurred $10.2 million of acquisition and integration costs in 2015 related to our acquisition of Kelway.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of Net sales, and the year-over-year percentage change for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars in\nMillions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\nMargin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars in\nMillions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\nMargin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\nin Income\nfrom Operations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segments: (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>470.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>439.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>343.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Headquarters (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(114.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(112.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>742.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>673.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Not meaningful\n (1) Segment income from operations includes the segment's direct operating income, allocations for Headquarters' costs, allocations for income and expenses from logistics services, certain inventory adjustments and volume rebates and cooperative advertising from vendors. \n (2) Includes the financial results for our other operating segments, CDW Advanced Services, Canada and five months for Kelway, which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds. \n (3) Includes certain Headquarters' function costs that are not allocated to the segments.  Income from operations was $742.0 million in 2015, an increase of $69.0 million, or 10.3%, compared to $673.0 million in 2014. Total operating margin increased 10 basis points to 5.7% in 2015, from 5.6% in 2014. Operating margin was positively impacted by the increase in gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales. This increase was driven by higher Net sales and Gross profit.\nCorporate segment income from operations was $470.1 million in 2015, an increase of $30.3 million, or 6.9%, compared to $439.8 million in 2014. Corporate segment operating margin increased 10 basis points to 6.9% in 2015, from 6.8% in 2014. This increase was driven by higher net sales and gross profit.\nPublic segment income from operations was $343.3 million in 2015, an increase of $30.1 million, or 9.6%, compared to $313.2 million in 2015. Public segment operating margin increased 30 basis points to 6.7% in 2015, from 6.4% in 2014. This increase was driven by higher net sales and gross profit.\nInterest expense, net\nAt December 31, 2015, our outstanding long-term debt totaled $3,259.7 million, compared to $3,166.0 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $93.7 million primarily due to the completion of the acquisition of Kelway. Net interest expense in 2015 was $159.5 million, a decrease of $37.8 million, compared to $197.3 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to lower effective interest rates for 2015, compared to 2014 as a result of redemptions and refinancing activities completed during 2014 and 2015.\nNet loss on extinguishments of long-term debt\nFor information regarding our debt, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2015, we recorded a net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt of $24.3 million compared to $90.7 million in 2014.\nNet loss on extinguishments of long-term debt for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Month of Extinguishment\n</td> <td>Debt Instrument\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount Extinguished\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Loss Recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 2015\n</td> <td>2019 Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>503.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Loss Recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 2014\n</td> <td>2019 Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>541.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 2014\n</td> <td>2019 Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>August 2014\n</td> <td>8.0% Senior Secured Notes due 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>325.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 2014\n</td> <td>Revolving Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 2014\n</td> <td>12.535% Senior Subordinated Exchange Notes due 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 2014\n</td> <td>2019 Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January and February 2014\n</td> <td>12.535% Senior Subordinated Exchange Notes due 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Loss Recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(90.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) We redeemed or repurchased all of or a portion of the remaining aggregate principal amount outstanding. The loss recognized represents the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt, adjusted for the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs and/or premium. \n (2) We entered into the Revolving Loan, a new $1,250 million five-year senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility. The Revolving Loan replaced our previous revolving loan credit facility that was to mature on June 24, 2016. The loss recognized represents the write-off of a portion of unamortized deferred financing costs.  Gain on remeasurement of equity investment\nOn August 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Kelway by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock which increased our ownership interest from 35% to 100%, and provided us control. As a result, our previously held 35% equity investment was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of $98.1 million recorded in Gain on remeasurement of equity investment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense was $243.9 million in 2015, compared to $142.8 million in 2014. The effective income tax rate, expressed by calculating income tax expense or benefit as a percentage of income before income taxes, was 37.7% and 36.8% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFor 2015, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and withholding tax expense on the earnings of our Canadian business as a result of no longer asserting permanent reinvestment which was partially offset by a deferred tax benefit as a result of a tax rate reduction in the U.K. For 2014, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, including current year state income tax credits. The higher effective tax rate for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to higher state income taxes due to lower state income tax credits and the aforementioned Canadian withholding tax expense partially offset by the deferred tax benefit reflecting the tax rate reduction in the U.K. We are asserting that the unremitted earnings of our U.K. business are indefinitely reinvested.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations\nWe have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Organic net sales growth and Organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 below. Non-GAAP net income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, non-cash equity-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses and gains and losses from the extinguishment of long-term debt. EBITDA is defined as consolidated Net income before interest expense, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below. Organic net sales growth is calculated as net sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions recorded within the last twelve months. Organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis is calculated as organic net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on organic net sales compared to the prior period. Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Organic net sales growth and Organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by us may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nWe believe that Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Organic net sales growth and Organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Adjusted EBITDA is also the primary measure used in certain key covenants and definitions contained in the credit agreement governing our Term Loan, including the excess cash flow payment provision, the restricted payment covenant and the net leverage ratio. These covenants and definitions are material components of the Term Loan as they are used in determining the interest rate applicable to the Term Loan, our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments. For further details regarding the Term Loan, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-GAAP net income\nNon-GAAP net income was $503.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $93.6 million, or 22.8%, compared to $409.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>403.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash equity-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash equity-based compensation related to equity investment(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition and integration expenses(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on remeasurement of equity investment(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(98.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate adjustment for income taxes (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(103.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP net income(7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>503.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>409.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, customer contracts and trade names. \n (2) Represents our 35% share of an expense related to certain equity awards granted by one of the sellers to Kelway coworkers in July 2015 prior to our acquisition of Kelway. \n (3) Primarily includes expenses related to the acquisition of Kelway. \n (4) Represents the gain resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held 35% equity investment to fair value upon the completion of the acquisition of Kelway. \n (5) Primarily includes expenses related to the consolidation of office locations north of Chicago and secondary-offering-related expenses. \n (6) Based on a normalized effective tax rate of 38.0% (39.0% prior to the Kelway acquisition), except for the non-cash equity-based compensation from our equity investment and the gain resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held 35% equity investment to fair value upon the completion of the acquisition of Kelway, which were tax effected at a rate of 35.4%.

and 2013.  Total Net sales in 2014 increased $1,305.9 million, or 12.1%, to $12,074.5 million, compared to $10,768.6 million in 2013. The increase in total Net sales was primarily the result of continued growth in transactional products driven by notebooks/mobile devices and desktop computers, as customers across all channels refreshed their client devices and K-12 customers continued to prepare for digital testing requirements, and the addition of more than 140 customer-facing coworkers, the majority in pre- and post-sale technical positions such as technical specialists and service delivery roles. Growth in solutions-focused products, including netcomm and software, also contributed to the increase in Net sales during 2014.\nCorporate segment net sales in 2014 increased $515.4 million, or 8.6%, compared to 2013, driven by sales growth in the medium/large customer channel. Within our Corporate segment, net sales to medium/large customers increased $432.7 million, or 8.6%, year over year, primarily due to customers refreshing their client devices and making continued investments in technology infrastructure and a continued focus on seller productivity. This increase was led by growth in notebooks/mobile devices, netcomm products, software, and desktop computers. Net sales to small business customers increased $82.7 million, or 9.1%, year over year, driven by growth in notebooks/mobile devices and desktop computers due to customers refreshing their client devices.\nPublic segment net sales in 2014 increased $714.9 million, or 17.2%, year over year, driven by strong performance across all channels. In 2013, and through the second quarter of 2014, Public segment results were impacted by the combined and residual negative effects of sequestration, the partial shutdown of the federal government in 2013 and federal government budget uncertainty. However, with the finalization of federal budget allocations in early 2014, we began to see improvement in federal sales in the second quarter of 2014 and saw continued momentum through the third quarter of 2014 in conjunction with the federal fiscal year-end. This recovery continued into the fourth quarter of 2014 in connection with increased customer confidence that a federal budget for 2015 would be in place. Net sales to government customers increased $198.8 million, or 15.9%. The increase in net sales to the federal government was led by increases in sales of notebooks/mobile devices and desktop computers. The increase in net sales to state/local government customers was led by growth in sales of notebooks/mobile devices, netcomm products, enterprise storage, and software due to a continued focus on public safety solutions. Net sales to education customers increased $375.0 million, or 25.9%, year over year, led by growth in net sales to K-12 customers, reflecting increased sales of notebooks/mobile devices to support digital testing requirements. Net sales to healthcare customers increased $141.1 million, or 9.6%, between periods, driven by growth in netcomm products, notebook/mobile devices, and desktop computers.\nGross profit\nGross profit increased $161.0 million, or 9.1%, to $1,921.3 million in 2014, compared to $1,760.3 million in 2013. As a percentage of Net sales, Gross profit decreased 40 basis points to 15.9% during 2014, down from 16.3% in 2013. Gross profit margin was negatively impacted 30 basis points by unfavorable price/mix changes within product margin, as transactional product categories such as notebooks/mobile devices and desktops experienced a higher rate of net sales growth than our overall net sales growth, accompanied by continuing product margin compression in these product categories. Additionally, we experienced an unfavorable impact of 10 basis points from vendor funding in 2014. Although vendor funding dollars increased, it represented a lower percentage of Net sales in 2014 compared to 2013. Vendor funding includes purchase discounts, volume rebates and cooperative advertising.\nGross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors, including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs, cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales, product mix, net service contract revenue, commission revenue, pricing strategies, market conditions and other factors.\nSelling and administrative expenses\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased $10.6 million, or 0.9%, to $1,110.3 million in 2014, compared to $1,120.9 million in 2013. The overall decrease was largely driven by the absence of $74.3 million in costs incurred during 2013 related to the completion of our IPO. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $31.4 million, or 14.3%, of certain coworker costs between years which was primarily due to higher compensation consistent with increased coworker count and attainment-based compensation accruals tied to annual performance. Total coworker count was 7,211, up 244 from 6,967 at December 31, 2013. In addition, sales payroll, including sales commissions and other variable compensation costs, increased $18.6 million, or 3.9% between years, consistent with higher sales and Gross profit. Further offsetting the decrease in Selling and administrative expenses was an increase in long-term compensation expense and equity compensation expense of $7.2 million during 2014.\nAs a percentage of Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses decreased 120 basis points to 9.2% in 2014, down from 10.4% in 2013. The decrease in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales was largely driven by a decline of 70 basis points in costs related to the IPO in 2013. Sales payroll as a percentage of Net sales also decreased 30 basis points during 2014, reflecting the lower cost to serve transactional sales compared to solutions-focused sales, consistent with our variable compensation cost structure.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of Net sales, and the year-over-year percentage change in Income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 is as follows:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars in\nMillions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\nMargin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars in\nMillions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\nMargin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\nin Income\nfrom Operations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segments: (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>439.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>363.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Headquarters (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(112.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(128.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>673.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>508.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Not meaningful\n (1) Segment income from operations includes the segment's direct operating income and allocations for Headquarters' costs, allocations for income and expenses from logistics services, certain inventory adjustments and volume rebates and cooperative advertising from vendors. \n (2) Includes certain Headquarters' function costs that are not allocated to the segments.  Income from operations was $673.0 million in 2014, an increase of $164.4 million, or 32.3%, compared to $508.6 million in 2013. The increase in Income from operations was driven by higher Net sales and Gross profit and the absence of IPO-related costs. Total operating margin percentage increased 90 basis points to 5.6% in 2014, from 4.7% in 2013. Operating margin percentage benefited from the decrease in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, which was driven by the absence of $74.3 million in costs related to our IPO in 2013, and was partially offset by a decrease in Gross profit margin.\nCorporate segment income from operations was $439.8 million in 2014, an increase of $76.5 million, or 21.1%, compared to $363.3 million in 2013. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales and gross profit. Corporate segment operating margin percentage increased 70 basis points to 6.8% in 2014, from 6.1% in 2013. Operating margin percentage benefited from the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, which was driven by the absence of costs related to our IPO in 2013, and was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit margin.\nPublic segment income from operations was $313.2 million in 2014, an increase of $66.7 million, or 27.1%, compared to $246.5 million in 2013. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales and gross profit. Public segment operating margin percentage increased 50 basis points to 6.4% in 2014, from 5.9% in 2013. Operating margin percentage benefited from the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, which was driven by the absence of costs related to our IPO in 2013, and was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit margin.\nInterest expense, net\nAt December 31, 2014, our outstanding long-term debt totaled $3,166.0 million, compared to $3,226.0 million at December 31, 2013. We reduced our long-term debt during 2014 through refinancing activities to redeem our higher interest debt. Net interest expense in 2014 was $197.3 million, a decrease of $52.8 million, compared to $250.1 million in 2013. This decrease was primarily due to lower debt balances and effective interest rates for 2014, compared to 2013 as a result of debt repayments and refinancing activities completed during 2014 and 2013.\nNet loss on extinguishments of long-term debt\nFor information regarding our debt, see Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2014, we recorded a net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt of $90.7 million compared to $64.0 million in 2013.\nNet loss on extinguishments of long-term debt for the year ended December 31, 2014 is as follows:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Month of Extinguishment\n</td> <td>Debt Instrument\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount Extinguished\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Loss Recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 2014\n</td> <td>2019 Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>541.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 2014\n</td> <td>2019 Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>August 2014\n</td> <td>8.0% Senior Secured Notes due 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>325.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 2014\n</td> <td>Revolving Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 2014\n</td> <td>12.535% Senior Subordinated Exchange Notes due 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 2014\n</td> <td>2019 Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January and February 2014\n</td> <td>12.535% Senior Subordinated Exchange Notes due 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Loss Recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(90.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 2013\n</td> <td>12.535% Senior Subordinated Exchange Notes due 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>August 2013\n</td> <td>12.535% Senior Subordinated Exchange Notes due 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>324.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>July 2013\n</td> <td>8.0% Senior Secured Notes due 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 2013\n</td> <td>Senior Secured Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 2013\n</td> <td>12.535% Senior Subordinated Exchange Notes due 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Loss Recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(64.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) We redeemed or repurchased all or a portion of the aggregate principal amount outstanding. The loss recognized represents the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt, adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs and/or unamortized premium. \n (2) We entered into the Revolving Loan, a new $1,250 million five-year senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility. The Revolving Loan replaced our previous revolving loan credit facility that was to mature on June 24, 2016. The loss recognized represents the write-off of a portion of unamortized deferred financing costs. \n (3) We entered into the Term Loan, a new $1,350 million seven-year Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. Substantially all of the proceeds were used to repay the $1,299.5 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the prior senior secured term loan facility. The loss recognized represents the write-off of a portion of unamortized deferred financing costs.  Income tax expense\nIncome tax expense was $142.8 million in 2014, compared to $62.7 million in 2013. The effective income tax rate, expressed by calculating income tax expense or benefit as a percentage of income before income taxes, was 36.8% and 32.1% for 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nFor 2014, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, including current year state income tax credits. For 2013, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, including current year state income tax credits and an adjustment to deferred state income taxes due to changes in apportionment factors. The higher effective tax rate for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of changes in state tax apportionment factors had on deferred state income taxes in 2013 and a lower rate impact of state income tax credits due to the increase in income before income taxes in 2014.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations\nWe have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 below. Non-GAAP net income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, non-cash equity-based compensation, and gains and losses from the extinguishment of long-term debt. EBITDA is defined as consolidated Net income before Interest expense, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below. Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by us may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nWe believe that Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Adjusted EBITDA is also the primary measure used in certain key covenants and definitions contained in the credit agreement governing our Term Loan, including the excess cash flow payment provision, the restricted payment covenant and the net leverage ratio. These covenants and definitions are material components of the Term Loan as they are used in determining the interest rate applicable to the Term Loan, our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments.
