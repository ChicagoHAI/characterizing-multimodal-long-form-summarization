A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is presented later in the Management's Discussion and Analysis under the heading \"Operating Segment Information\" and \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The amendments are based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method, with the cumulative effect recognized as of January 1, 2018. All applicable amounts and disclosures for 2018 reflect the impact of adoption. As we elected to use the modified retrospective method, prior periods presented have not been restated to reflect the impact of adoption. Reclassifications have been made where noted for conforming presentation only (see Notes 1(p) and 14 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report).\nOur business outlook is affected by both increasing complexity in the global security environment and continuing worldwide economic pressures. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on delivering excellent performance to our customers, driving improvements and efficiencies across our operations, and creating value through the enhancement and expansion of our business.\nSome of the significant challenges we face are as follows: dependence upon U.S. government programs and contracts, future reductions or changes in U.S. government spending in our markets, successful implementation of our cost reduction plans, environmental matters, capital structure, underfunded retirement benefit plans, and information technology and cyber security.\nMajor Customers\nThe principal end user customers of our products and technology are primarily agencies of the U.S. government. Since a majority of our sales are, directly or indirectly, to the U.S. government, funding for the purchase of our products and services generally follows trends in U.S. aerospace and defense spending. However, individual U.S. government agencies, which include the military services, NASA, the Missile Defense Agency, and the prime contractors that serve these agencies, exercise independent purchasing power within \"budget top-line\" limits. Therefore, sales to the U.S. government are not regarded as sales to one customer, but rather each contracting agency is viewed as a separate customer.\nThe following table summarizes net sales to the U.S. government and its agencies, including net sales to significant customers disclosed below: Table 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>Percentage of Net\nSales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes net sales by principal end user in 2018:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NASA\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Air Force\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Army\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Missile Defense Agency\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Navy\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other U.S. government\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. government customers\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other customers\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the percentages of net sales for significant programs, all of which are included in the U.S. government sales and are comprised of multiple contracts:\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RS-25 program\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standard Missile program\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>THAAD program\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes customers that represented more than 10% of net sales, each of which involves sales of several product lines and programs: Table 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lockheed Martin\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Raytheon\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NASA\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ULA\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndustry Update\nInformation concerning our industry appears in Part I, Item 1. Business under the caption \"Industry Overview.\"\nCompetitive Improvement Program\nDuring 2015, we initiated Phase I of our CIP comprised of activities and initiatives aimed at reducing costs in order for us to continue to compete successfully. Phase I is comprised of three major components: (i) facilities optimization and footprint reduction; (ii) product affordability; and (iii) reduced administrative and overhead costs. On April 6, 2017, the Board of Directors approved Phase II of our previously announced CIP. Pursuant to Phase II, we expanded CIP and further consolidated our Sacramento, California, and Gainesville, Virginia sites, while centralizing and expanding our existing presence in Huntsville, Alabama. When fully implemented, we anticipate that the CIP will result in annual costs that are $230 million below levels anticipated prior to CIP.\nWe currently estimate that we will incur restructuring and related costs of the Phase I and II programs of approximately $210.0 million (including approximately $60.5 million of capital expenditures). Our current estimate is down from the initial estimate of $235.0 million primarily due to efficiencies in program transitions and lower than expected employee costs. We have incurred $131.4 million of such costs through December 31, 2018, including $48.1 million in capital expenditures.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur current and former business operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes. See Notes 8(c) and 8(d) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report and \"Environmental Matters\" below for summary of our environmental reserve activity.\nCapital Structure\nWe have a substantial amount of debt for which we are required to make interest and principal payments. Interest on long-term financing is not a recoverable cost under our U.S. government contracts. As of December 31, 2018, we had $625.4 million of debt outstanding. In 2018, we entered into an industrial bond transaction with a subsidiary to realize property tax savings.\nRetirement Benefits\nAs of the last measurement date at December 31, 2018, the pension assets, projected benefit obligations, and unfunded pension obligation were $894.8 million, $1,288.7 million, and $393.9 million, respectively. We estimate that 82% of our unfunded pension obligation as of December 31, 2018, is related to our U.S. government contracting business, Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nOn September 10, 2018, we made a discretionary contribution of 2.7 million treasury stock, or $95.0 million, of our common stock to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. This voluntary contribution will help address the current underfunding of the tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. This contribution was tax deductible in the current period and will be used as a pre-funding credit.\nWe expect to make cash contributions of approximately $37.0 million to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2019. We generally are able to recover cash contributions related to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan as allowable costs on our U.S. government contracts, but there can be differences between when we contribute cash to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan under pension funding rules and recover it under CAS.\nInformation Technology and Cyber Security\nWe routinely experience cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to our sensitive information, as do our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and other partners. In 2017, we outsourced certain information technology and cyber security functions to third-party contractors in order to take advantage of advanced cyber security technologies. The visibility provided by the additional cyber security technologies identified vulnerabilities and resulted in additional costs to remediate throughout 2018. The transition to the outsourced provider impacted our level of control over the performance and delivery of such service to the business.\nWe continue to assess our information technology systems and are engaged in cooperative efforts with our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions.\nResults of Operations:\nNet Sales:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change**\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales:\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,895.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,877.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,877.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,761.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Primary reason for change. Net sales were impacted by the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. The primary impact of the new guidance was a change in the timing of revenue recognition on certain long-term contracts. Under this new guidance, we discontinued the use of the unit-of-delivery method on certain customer contracts and re-measured the performance obligations using the cost-to-cost method. Net sales in 2018 would have been $1,910.0 million under the previous revenue recognition guidance which is $32.8 million higher than net sales reported in 2017, resulting from an increase of $126.0 million in defense programs primarily driven by increased deliveries on the Standard Missile and PAC-3 programs. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $94.6 million in space programs primarily driven by cost growth and performance issues on the Commercial Crew Development program and lower deliveries on the Atlas V program as this program winds down. The Atlas V program contributed sales of $42.6 million under the new revenue recognition guidance in 2018, and sales of $89.1 million under the previous revenue recognition guidance in 2018.\n** Primary reason for change. The increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase of $158.0 million in space programs primarily driven by the following (i) the RS-25 program development and integration effort in support of the SLS development program; (ii) increased development effort and volume on the Commercial Crew Development program; and (iii) increased deliveries on the Atlas V program. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $36.5 million in defense programs primarily driven by the timing of deliveries on the THAAD and Standard Missile programs partially offset by the net sales generated from the Coleman Aerospace acquisition. Further, as a result of the 2016 calendar, Aerojet Rocketdyne had 53 weeks of operations in 2016 compared with 52 weeks of operations in 2017. The additional week of operations, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 and accounted for $32.2 million in additional net sales, is included in the above discussion of program changes.\nCost of Sales (exclusive of items shown separately below):\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change**\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions, except percentage amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,549.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,562.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,562.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,477.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales\n</td> <td>81.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Primary reason for change. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the following: (i) risk retirements on the RS-68 program, (ii) favorable overhead rate performance, and (iii) cost growth and manufacturing inefficiencies in 2017 on electric propulsion contracts. These factors were partially offset by cost growth and performance issues in the current period on the Commercial Crew Development program and favorable contract performance on the THAAD program in 2017 as a result of risk retirements and cost reductions. The same factors drove the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales under the previous revenue recognition guidance.\n** Primary reason for change. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to favorable contract performance on numerous programs as a result of overhead cost reductions and reduced program risks, most notably on the THAAD program, partially offset by cost growth and manufacturing inefficiencies in 2017 on electric propulsion contracts.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense (\"SG&A\"): Table 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change**\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions, except percentage amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of SG&A:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A excluding stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales excluding stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Primary reason for change.

The increase in SG&A expense was primarily driven by an increase of $9.1 million in stock-based compensation primarily as a result of increases in the fair value of stock appreciation rights, the accelerated vesting of stock awards to a former executive officer, and the August 2016 stock award granted to the Executive Chairman that vested according to the attainment of share prices ranging from $22 per share to $27 per share of our common stock.\nDepreciation and Amortization:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change**\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of depreciation and amortization:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accretion\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Primary reason for change.

The increase in interest expense was primarily due to a higher variable interest rate on our Senior Credit Facility partially offset by a lower principal balance on the Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility variable interest rate was 4.52% as of December 31, 2018, compared with 3.82% as of December 31, 2017.\n** Primary reason for change. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the retirement of the principal amount of our delayed draw term loan in the first quarter of 2016, the redemption of the 7 1/8% Notes in the third quarter of 2016, and the conversion of 41/16% Convertible Subordinated Debentures to common shares. The decrease was partially offset by interest expense on the debt incurred on the Senior Credit Facility at a variable interest rate of 3.82% as of December 31, 2017, and the issuance of the 2\u00bc% Notes in December 2016 at an effective interest rate of 5.8%.\nIncome Tax Provision: Table 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2018, our effective tax rate was 27.2%. Our effective tax rate differed from the 21% statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to an increase from state income taxes and unfavorable adjustments to uncertain tax positions partially offset by R&D credits.\nIn 2017, our effective tax rate was 110.6%. Our effective tax rate differed from the 35.0% statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the change in the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% under Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). The one time reduction to deferred tax assets due to the Tax Act was $64.6 million or a 74.4% increase to the effective tax rate. Before applying the effects of the Tax Act, the effective tax rate was 36.2%. This rate differs from the 35% federal income tax rate due to an increase from state income taxes partially offset by R&D credits and favorable adjustments to uncertain tax positions.\nIn 2016, the income tax provision recorded differs from the expected tax that would be calculated by applying the federal statutory rate to our income before income taxes primarily due to the impacts from state income taxes, and certain expenditures which are permanently not deductible for tax purposes, partially offset by the impact of R&D credits.\nWe recorded an initial estimate of our current tax payable of $127.7 million during the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, based on our best estimate of the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance and the enactment of certain provisions of tax reform under the Tax Act, both effective on January 1, 2018. Subsequently, guidance was issued by federal taxing authorities providing clarification on provisions within the Tax Act. This new clarification allows us to spread the impact of adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance over a four-year period, reducing the single-year impact in 2018. The current tax payable of $19.8 million as of December 31, 2018, reflects this reduction as well as other refinements to the estimated impacts from both the new revenue recognition guidance and the Tax Act.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the liability for uncertain income tax positions was $5.9 million. Due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid.\nRetirement Benefit Expense:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of retirement benefits expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest cost on benefit obligation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumed return on assets\n</td> <td>(60.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of prior service credits\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of net losses\n</td> <td>66.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retirement benefits expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Primary reason for change.

Segment performance represents net sales less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for unusual items relating to the segment. Excluded from segment performance are: corporate income and expenses, interest expense, interest income, income taxes, legacy income or expenses, and unusual items not related to the segment. We believe that segment performance provides information useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance. In addition, we provide the Non-GAAP financial measure of our operational performance called segment performance before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, and segment unusual items. We believe the exclusion of the items listed above permits an evaluation and a comparison of results for ongoing business operations, and it is on this basis that management internally assesses operational performance.\nAerospace and Defense Segment\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change**\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions, except percentage amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,888.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,870.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,870.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,753.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment performance\n</td> <td>264.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment margin\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment margin before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, net, and unusual items (Non-GAAP measure)\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of segment performance:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerospace and Defense before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, net, and unusual items (Non-GAAP measure)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>233.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental remediation provision adjustments\n</td> <td>37.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP/CAS retirement benefits expense difference\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unusual items\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerospace and Defense total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>264.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales were impacted by the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. The primary impact of the new guidance was a change in the timing of revenue recognition on certain long-term contracts. Under this new guidance, we discontinued the use of the unit-of-delivery method on certain customer contracts and re-measured the performance obligations using the cost-to-cost method.\nSegment performance during 2018 was significantly impacted by a one-time benefit of $43.0 million as a result of reaching a determination with the U.S. government that certain environmental expenditures are reimbursable under the Global Settlement. See Note 8(d) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.\n* Primary reason for change. Net sales in 2018 would have been $1,902.2 million under the previous revenue recognition guidance which is $31.4 million higher than net sales reported in 2017, resulting from an increase of $126.0 million in defense programs primarily driven by increased deliveries on the Standard Missile and PAC-3 programs. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $94.6 million in space programs primarily driven by cost growth and performance issues on the Commercial Crew Development program and lower deliveries on the Atlas V program as this program winds down. The Atlas V program contributed sales of $42.6 million under the new revenue recognition guidance in 2018, and sales of $89.1 million under the previous revenue recognition guidance in 2018.\nThe increase in the segment margin before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, net and unusual items was primarily due to the following: (i) risk retirements on the RS-68 program, (ii) favorable overhead rate performance, and (iii) cost growth and manufacturing inefficiencies in 2017 on electric propulsion contracts. These factors were partially offset by cost growth and performance issues in the current period on the Commercial Crew Development program and favorable contract performance on the THAAD program in 2017 as a result of risk retirements and cost reductions.\nDuring 2018, we had $59.1 million of favorable changes in contract estimates on operating results before income taxes compared with favorable changes of $37.2 million during 2017.\n** Primary reason for change. The increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase of $158.0 million in space programs primarily driven by the following (i) the RS-25 program development and integration effort in support of the SLS development program; (ii) increased development effort and volume on the Commercial Crew Development program; and (iii) increased deliveries on the Atlas V program. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $36.5 million in defense programs primarily driven by the timing of deliveries on the THAAD and Standard Missile programs partially offset by the net sales generated from the Coleman Aerospace acquisition. Further, as a result of the 2016 calendar, Aerojet Rocketdyne had 53 weeks of operations in 2016 compared with 52 weeks of operations in 2017. The additional week of operations, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 and accounted for $32.2 million in additional net sales, is included in the above discussion of program changes.\nSegment margin before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, net, and unusual items in 2017 compared with 2016 was up 30 basis points. Items that had a significant impact were favorable contract performance on numerous programs as a result of overhead cost reductions and reduced program risks, most notably on the THAAD program, partially offset by cost growth and manufacturing inefficiencies in 2017 on electric propulsion contracts.\nReal Estate Segment\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment performance\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2018, we recognized net sales of $1.4 million from a land sale of 57 acres of the Sacramento Land.

Total backlog includes both funded backlog (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated). Indefinite delivery and quantity contracts and unexercised options are not reported in total backlog. Backlog is subject to funding delays or program restructurings/cancellations which are beyond our control.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\nIn addition to segment performance (discussed above), we provide the Non-GAAP financial measures of our performance called Adjusted EBITDAP, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS. We use these metrics to measure our operating and total Company performance. We believe that for management and investors to effectively compare core performance from period to period, the metrics should exclude items that are not indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations such as retirement benefits (pension and postretirement benefits), significant non-cash expenses, the impacts of financing decisions on earnings, and items incurred outside the ordinary, on-going and customary course of our business. Accordingly, we define Adjusted EBITDAP as GAAP net income (loss) adjusted to exclude interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, retirement benefits net of amounts that are recoverable under our U.S. government contracts, and unusual items which we do not believe are reflective of such ordinary, on-going and customary activities. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS exclude retirement benefits net of amounts that are recoverable under our U.S. government contracts and unusual items which we do not believe are reflective of such ordinary, on-going and customary activities. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income (loss) or diluted EPS as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 73:

Non-GAAP financial measure of Free Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow, a Non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to cash flows from operations presented in accordance with GAAP. We use Free Cash Flow, both in presenting our results to stakeholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluation and management of the business. Management believes that this financial measure is useful because it provides supplemental information to assist investors in viewing the business using the same tools that management uses to evaluate progress in achieving our goals (including under our annual cash and long-term compensation\nincentive plans).

These measures are not recognized in accordance with GAAP, and we do not intend for this information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures.\nEnvironmental Matters:\nOur policy is to conduct our businesses with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We devote a significant amount of resources and management attention to environmental matters and actively manage our ongoing processes to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We are involved in the remediation of environmental conditions that resulted from generally accepted manufacturing and disposal practices at certain plants in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, we have been designated a PRP with other companies at third party sites undergoing investigation and remediation.\nEstimating environmental remediation costs is difficult due to the significant uncertainties inherent in these activities, including the extent of remediation required, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, evolving technologies and the long period of time over which most remediation efforts take place. We:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>accrue for costs associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and when our proportionate share of the costs can be reasonably estimated; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>record related estimated recoveries when such recoveries are deemed probable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition to the costs associated with environmental remediation discussed above, we incur expenditures for recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances or pollutants in ongoing operations which were immaterial for 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nThe following table summarizes our recoverable amounts, environmental reserves, and range of liability, as of December 31, 2018: Table 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Recoverable\nAmount (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Reserve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Range\nof Liability\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerojet Rocketdyne - Sacramento\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>207.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$207.4 - $311.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerojet Rocketdyne - Baldwin Park Operable Unit (\"BPOU\")\n</td> <td>91.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.8 - 132.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Aerojet Rocketdyne sites\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4 - 22.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other sites\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3 - 5.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>285.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>327.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$327.9 - $472.1\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Excludes the receivable from Northrop of $58.5 million as of December 31, 2018, related to environmental costs already paid (and therefore not reserved) by us in prior years and reimbursable under our agreement with Northrop.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Environmental Reserves\nWe review on a quarterly basis estimated future remediation costs and have an established practice of estimating environmental remediation costs over a fifteen year period, except for those environmental remediation costs with a specific contractual term. Environmental liabilities at the BPOU site are currently estimated through the term of the new project agreement, which expires in May 2027. As the period for which estimated environmental remediation costs lengthens, the reliability of such estimates decreases. These estimates consider the investigative work and analysis of engineers, outside environmental consultants, and the advice of legal staff regarding the status and anticipated results of various administrative and legal proceedings. In most cases, only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated. In establishing our reserves, the most probable estimate is used when determinable; otherwise, the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Accordingly, such estimates can change as we periodically evaluate these estimates when new information becomes available. We cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will affect the estimated liability accrued. The timing of payment for estimated future environmental costs is influenced by a number of factors, such as the regulatory approval process and the time required designing, constructing, and implementing the remedy.\nThe following tables summarizes our environmental reserve activity:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>341.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>349.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>302.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenditures\n</td> <td>(36.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>327.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>341.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>349.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $23.3 million of environmental reserve additions in 2018 was primarily due to the following items: (i) $8.8 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $4.6 million of regulatory oversight costs and fees; (iii) $3.8 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (iv) $2.2 million of sampling analysis costs; and (v) $3.9 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nThe $31.3 million of environmental reserve additions in 2017 was primarily due to the following items: (i) $13.4 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $6.7 million of additional estimated costs related to the Camden, Arkansas site; (iii) $2.3 million associated with water replacement; and (iv) $8.9 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nThe $87.4 million of environmental reserve additions in 2016 was primarily due to the following items: (i) in 2016, we reached a decision with the U.S. government on the treatment of certain utility costs related to the Sacramento site resulting in a reserve increase of $59.4 million for the estimated impact over the current period and a fifteen year reserve period; (ii) $10.4 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (iii) $5.9 million of remediation related to inactive test sites and landfill clean-up; (iv) $2.7 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; and (v) $9.0 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nThe effect of the final resolution of environmental matters and our obligations for environmental remediation and compliance cannot be accurately predicted due to the uncertainty concerning both the amount and timing of future expenditures and due to regulatory or technological changes. We continue our efforts to mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of claims for recoveries from our insurance carriers and other PRPs and continued investigation of new and more cost effective remediation alternatives and associated technologies.\nEstimated Recoveries\nEnvironmental remediation costs are primarily incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these costs are recoverable from our contracts with the U.S. government. We currently estimate approximately 12% of our future Aerospace and Defense segment environmental remediation costs will not likely be reimbursable and are expensed.\nAllowable environmental remediation costs are charged to our contracts as the costs are incurred. Because these costs are recovered through forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet Rocketdyne to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on Aerojet Rocketdyne's sustained business volume from U.S. government contracts and programs.\nWhile we are currently seeking an arrangement with the U.S. government to recover environmental expenditures in excess of the reimbursement ceiling identified in the Global Settlement, there can be no assurances that such a recovery will be obtained, or if not obtained, that such unreimbursed environmental expenditures will not have a materially adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the current and non-current recoverable amounts from the U.S. government and Northrop: Table 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>321.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions\n</td> <td>18.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reimbursements\n</td> <td>(28.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments (1)\n</td> <td>32.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>344.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>321.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____\n(1) The adjustment in 2018 was primarily a result of reaching a determination with the U.S. government that certain environmental expenditures are reimbursable under the Global Settlement.

The increased cash usage from working capital was primarily due to (i) an increase of $47.3 million in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of cash receipts; (ii) an increase of $38.7 million in net income tax payments; and (iii) a decrease of $39.4 million in accounts payable due to vendor payment schedules. These factors were partially offset by improved cash flow from contracts of $39.7 million primarily due to the timing of contract performance payments.\nThe $54.1 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily driven by improved operating results and cash generation from working capital partially offset by $43.0 million of increased retirement benefit funding. The improved cash generation from working capital was primarily due to (i) a decrease in inventories on the Atlas V and PAC-3 contracts and (ii) an increase in customer advances partially offset by an increase in accounts receivables due to the timing of sales and milestone billings on a space program contract.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nDuring 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had capital expenditures of $43.2 million, $29.4 million, and $47.6 million. The higher capital expenditures in 2016 compared with 2018 and 2017 was primarily related to construction projects associated with supporting our CIP.\nDuring the 2018, we received insurance proceeds of $1.9 million and received net proceeds of $20.4 million in marketable securities.\nDuring 2017, we purchased Coleman Aerospace for $17.0 million and we made a net cash investment of $20.0 million in marketable securities.\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nDuring 2018, we had debt cash payments of $25.3 million. During 2017, we had debt cash payments of $20.0 million. During 2016, we had $700.6 million in debt cash payments and borrowings of $800.0 million.\nDebt Activity\nThe following table summarizes our debt principal activity: Table 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cash\nPayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-cash Activity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>370.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>345.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2 1/4% Notes\n</td> <td>300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Debt Activity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>670.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>672.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn September 20, 2018, we amended our Senior Credit Facility to a $1.0 billion commitment (see Note 6 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report).\nOutlook\nShort-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of recurring operating expenses, including but not limited to costs related to our capital and environmental expenditures, company-funded R&D expenditures, debt service requirements, and retirement benefit plans. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and availability under the Senior Credit Facility coupled with cash generated from our future operations will provide sufficient funds to meet our operating plan for the next twelve months. The operating plan for this period provides for full operation of our businesses, including interest and debt payments. As of December 31, 2018, we had $735.3 million of cash and cash equivalents as well as $620.6 million of available borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. Based on our existing debt agreements, we were in compliance with our financial and non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2018. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived by the lenders, could result in the acceleration of the Senior Credit Facility and 2\u00bc% Notes. In addition, our failure to pay principal and interest when due is a default under the Senior Credit Facility, and in certain cases, would cause a cross default on the 2\u00bc% Notes.\nWe are committed to a cash management strategy that maintains liquidity to adequately support the operation of the business, our growth strategy and to withstand unanticipated business volatility. Our cash management strategy includes maintaining the flexibility to pay down debt and/or repurchase shares depending on economic and other conditions. In connection with the implementation of our cash management strategy, our management may seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise if we believe that it is in our best interests. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nPotential future acquisitions depend, in part, on the availability of financial resources at an acceptable cost of capital. We expect to utilize cash on hand and cash generated by operations, as well as cash available under our Senior Credit Facility, which may involve renegotiation of credit limits to finance any future acquisitions. Other sources of capital could include the issuance of common and/or preferred stock, and the placement of debt. We periodically evaluate capital markets and may access such markets when circumstances appear favorable. We believe that sufficient capital resources will be available from one or several of these sources to finance any future acquisitions. However, no assurances can be made that acceptable financing will be available, or that acceptable acquisition candidates will be identified, or that any such acquisitions will be accretive to earnings.\nAs disclosed in Notes 8(b) and 8(c) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report, we have exposure for certain legal and environmental matters. We believe that it is currently not possible to estimate the impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of certain of these matters will have on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nMajor factors that could adversely impact our forecasted operating cash flows and our financial condition are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition, our liquidity and financial condition will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates on the portion of debt that bears interest at variable interest rates.\nContractual Obligations:\nWe have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of debt obligations, operating leases, certain other liabilities, and other commitments.

We generally are able to recover cash contributions related to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan as allowable costs on our U.S. government contracts, but there can be differences between when we contribute cash to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan under pension funding rules and recover it under CAS.\nArrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk:\nSee Note 8(e) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for information relating to our off-balance sheet risk.\nCritical Accounting Policies:\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP that offer acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain items affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets, and recognizing revenues.\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments, and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Although we believe that the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different\nconclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively and, if significant, disclosed in notes of the consolidated financial statements.\nThe areas most affected by our accounting policies and estimates are revenue recognition, other contract considerations, goodwill, retirement benefit plans, litigation, environmental remediation costs and recoveries, and income taxes. Except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our operating segments, these areas affect the financial results of our business segments.\nFor a discussion of all of our accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn our Aerospace and Defense segment, the majority of our revenue is earned from long-term contracts to design, develop, and manufacture aerospace and defense products, and provide related services, for our customers, including the U.S. government, major aerospace and defense prime contractors, and the commercial sector. Each customer contract defines our distinct performance obligations and the associated transaction price for each obligation. A contract may contain one or multiple performance obligations. In certain circumstances, multiple contracts with a customer are required to be combined in determining the distinct performance obligation. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contracted transaction price to each performance obligation based upon the relative standalone selling price, which represents the price at which we would sell the promised good or service separately to the customer. We determine the standalone selling price based upon the facts and circumstances of each obligated good or service. The majority of our contracts have no observable standalone selling price since the associated products and services are customized to customer specifications. As such, the standalone selling price generally reflects our forecast of the total cost to satisfy the performance obligation plus an appropriate profit margin.\nContract modifications are routine in the performance of our long-term contracts. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. In most instances, contract modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct, and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract.\nWe recognize revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of our aerospace and defense performance obligations are satisfied over time either as the service is provided, or as control transfers to the customer. Transfer of control is evidenced by our contractual right to payment for work performed to date plus a reasonable profit on contracts with highly customized products that we have no alternative use for. We measure progress on substantially all our performance obligations using the cost-to-cost method, which we believe best depicts the transfer of control of goods and services to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost method, we record revenues based upon costs incurred to date relative to the total estimated cost at completion. Contract costs include labor, material, overhead, and general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.\nRecognition of revenue and profit on long-term contracts requires the use of assumptions and estimates related to the total contract value, the total cost at completion, and the measurement of progress towards completion for each performance obligation. Due to the nature of the programs, developing the estimated total contract value and total cost at completion for each performance obligation requires the use of significant judgment.\nThe contract value of long-term contracts may include variable consideration, such as incentives, awards, or penalties. The value of variable consideration is generally determined by contracted performance metrics, which may include targets for cost, performance, quality, and schedule. We include variable consideration in the transaction price for the respective performance obligation at either estimated value, or most likely amount to be earned, based upon our assessment of expected performance. We record these amounts only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.\nWe evaluate the contract value and cost estimates for performance obligations at least quarterly and more frequently when circumstances significantly change. Factors considered in estimating the work to be completed include, but are not limited to: labor productivity, the nature and technical complexity of the work to be performed, availability and cost volatility of materials, subcontractor and vendor performance, warranty costs, volume assumptions, anticipated labor agreements, inflationary trends, schedule and performance delays, availability of funding from the customer, and the recoverability of costs incurred outside the original contract included in any estimates to complete. When our estimate of total costs to be incurred to satisfy a performance obligation exceeds the expected revenue, we recognize the loss immediately. When we determine that a change in estimates has an impact on the associated profit of a performance obligation, we record the cumulative positive or negative adjustment to the statement of operations. Changes in estimates and assumptions related to the status of certain long-term contracts may have a material effect on our operating results. The following table summarizes the impact of the changes in significant contract\naccounting estimates on our Aerospace and Defense segment operating results: Table 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions, except per share amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net favorable effect of the changes in contract estimates on net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Favorable effect of the changes in contract estimates on income before income taxes\n</td> <td>59.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Favorable effect of the changes in contract estimates on net income (loss)\n</td> <td>43.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Favorable effect of the changes in contract estimates on basic net income (loss) per share\n</td> <td>0.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Favorable effect of the changes in contract estimates on diluted net income (loss) per share\n</td> <td>0.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 1(p) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.\nOther Contract Considerations\nThe majority of Aerospace and Defense segment sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products and perform services under contracts with the U.S. government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR and CAS. The FAR and CAS provide guidance on the types of costs that are allowable and allocable in establishing prices for goods and services from U.S. government contracts. For example, costs such as charitable contributions, advertising, interest expense, and public relations are unallowable, and therefore not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into agreements with the U.S. government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters.\nWe closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. We review the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. government are reviewed for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the DCAA. Accordingly, we record an allowance on our unbilled receivables for amounts of potential contract overhead costs which may not be successfully negotiated and collected.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired enterprise or assets over the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All of our recorded goodwill resides in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. Tests for impairment of goodwill are performed on an annual basis, or at any other time if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; loss of key personnel; decline in stock price; and results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit.\nWe evaluate qualitative factors (including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial performance) to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the goodwill test. This step is referred to as the \"Step Zero\" analysis. If it is determined that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will proceed to the quantitative (\"Step One\") analysis to determine the existence and amount of any goodwill impairment. We may also perform a Step One analysis from time to time to augment our qualitative assessment. We evaluated goodwill using a \"Step One\" analysis as of October 1, 2018, and determined that goodwill was not impaired. We evaluated goodwill using a \"Step Zero\" analysis as of October 1, 2017, and determined that goodwill was not impaired.\nThere can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions and estimates are incorrect, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods.\nRetirement Benefit Plans\nWe discontinued future benefit accruals for our defined benefit pension plans in 2009. We provide medical and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retired employees, with varied coverage by employee group. Annual charges are made for the cost of the plans, including interest costs on benefit obligations, and net amortization and deferrals, increased or reduced by the return on assets. We also sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan and participation in the plan is available to all employees.\nRetirement benefits are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimates. We generally are able to recover cash contributions related to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan as allowable costs on our U.S. government contracts, but there is a lag between when we contribute cash to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan under pension funding rules and recover it under our U.S.\ngovernment contracts. Our pension and medical and life insurance benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts in accordance with GAAP. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine the retirement benefit obligations and expense (income) for the year.\nThe following table presents the assumptions to determine the benefit obligations: Table 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pension\nBenefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Medical and\nLife Insurance Benefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>4.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.09\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents the assumptions to determine the retirement benefits expense (income):\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Medical and\nLife Insurance Benefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>3.59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.68\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term rate of return on assets\n</td> <td>7.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Not applicable as our medical and life insurance benefits are unfunded.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The discount rate represents the current market interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle pension obligations. Based on market conditions, discount rates can experience significant variability. Changes in discount rates can significantly change the liability and, accordingly, the funded status of the pension plan. The assumed discount rate represents the market rate available for investments in high-quality fixed income instruments with maturities matched to the expected benefit payments for pension and medical and life insurance benefit plans.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on assets represents the rate of earnings expected in the funds invested, and funds to be invested, to provide for anticipated benefit payments to plan participants. We evaluated the historical investment performance, current and expected asset allocation, and, with input from our external advisors, developed best estimates of future investment performance.\nMarket conditions and interest rates significantly affect assets and liabilities of our pension plans. Pension accounting permits market gains and losses to be deferred and recognized over a period of years. This \"smoothing\" results in the creation of other accumulated income or loss which will be amortized to pension costs in future years. The accounting method we utilize recognizes one-fifth of the unamortized gains and losses in the market-related value of pension assets and all other gains and losses including changes in the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligation each year. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return and the actual return on the market-related value of assets which smoothes asset values over three years. Although the smoothing period mitigates some volatility in the calculation of annual pension costs, future pension costs are impacted by changes in the market value of assets and changes in interest rates.\nThe following table summarizes the effects of a one-percentage-point change in key assumptions on the projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018, and on retirement benefits expense for 2018:\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefits and\nMedical and Life Insurance Benefits Discount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expected Long-term\nRate of Return\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Assumed Healthcare\nCost Trend Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Periodic\nBenefit Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Projected\nBenefit\nObligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Periodic Pension\nBenefit Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Periodic\nMedical and Life\nInsurance Benefit Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Accumulated\nBenefit\nObligation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease\n</td> <td>$20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$128.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(0.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(0.5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase\n</td> <td>(17.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(108.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContingencies and Litigation\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued our estimate of the probable costs and recoveries for resolution of these claims. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions or the effectiveness of strategies related to these proceedings. See Notes 8(b) and 8(c) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for more detailed information on litigation exposure.\nEnvironmental Reserves and Estimated Recoveries\nFor a discussion of our accounting for environmental remediation obligations and costs and related legal matters, see \"Environmental Matters\" above and Notes 8(c) and 8(d) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nWe accrue for costs associated with the remediation of environmental contamination when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred, and when our costs can be reasonably estimated. In most cases, only a range of reasonably probable costs can be estimated. In establishing the reserves, the most probable estimated amount is used when determinable, and the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Environmental reserves include the costs of completing remedial investigation and feasibility studies, remedial and corrective actions, regulatory oversight costs, the cost of operation and maintenance of the remedial action plan, and employee compensation costs for employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of time to remediation efforts. Calculation of environmental reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual environmental site and considers factors such as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Such estimates are based on the expected costs of investigation and remediation and the likelihood that other potentially responsible parties will be able to fulfill their commitments at sites where we may be jointly or severally liable.\nAt the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, we record an asset for estimated future recoveries that are estimable and probable. Some of our environmental costs are eligible for future recovery in the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government and under existing third party agreements. We consider the recovery probable based on the Global Settlement, U.S. government contracting regulations, and our long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs.\nIncome Taxes\nWe file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return for the Company and our 100% owned consolidated subsidiaries. The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date of the change.\nThe carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including our past and future performance, the market environment in which we operate, the utilization of tax attributes in the past, the length of carryback and carryforward periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies.\nDespite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged by taxing authorities. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. Our tax reserves reflect the difference between the tax benefit claimed on tax returns and the amount recognized in the financial statements. The accounting standards provide guidance for the recognition and measurement in financial statements of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process, the first step being recognition. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. As the examination process progresses with tax authorities, adjustments to tax reserves may be necessary to reflect taxes payable upon settlement. Tax reserve adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Tax reserve adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in Item 8 of this Report, the risk factors appearing in Item 1A of this Report, and the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements appearing at the beginning of Item 1 of this Report.\nOverview\nA summary of the significant financial highlights for 2018, which management uses to evaluate our operating performance and financial condition, is presented below.\n \u2022 Net sales for 2018 totaled $1,895.9 million compared with $1,877.2 million for 2017. \n \u2022 Net income for 2018 was $137.3 million, or $1.75 diluted income per share (\"EPS\"), compared with net loss of $(9.2) million, or $(0.13) diluted EPS for 2017. \n \u2022 Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP measure*) for 2018 was $151.5 million, or $1.93 Adjusted EPS (Non-GAAP measure*), compared with $76.0 million, or $1.02 Adjusted EPS for 2017. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDAP (Non-GAAP measure*) for 2018 was $304.9 million compared with $222.9 million for 2017. \n \u2022 Segment performance before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, net, and unusual items (Non-GAAP measure*) was $236.2 million for 2018, compared with $202.9 million for 2017. \n \u2022 Cash provided by operating activities in 2018 totaled $252.7 million compared with $212.8 million in 2017. \n \u2022 Free cash flow (Non-GAAP measure*) in 2018 totaled $209.5 million compared with $183.4 million in 2017. \n \u2022 Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue recognition guidance. Consistent with the standard, net assets increased by $37.6 million and $578.0 million of net sales were recognized in the cumulative effect at January 1, 2018, with a corresponding reduction to backlog. \n \u2022 Total backlog as of December 31, 2018, was $4.1 billion compared with $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2017.  _________\n* We provide Non-GAAP measures as a supplement to financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is presented later in the Management's Discussion and Analysis under the heading \"Operating Segment Information\" and \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The amendments are based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method, with the cumulative effect recognized as of January 1, 2018. All applicable amounts and disclosures for 2018 reflect the impact of adoption. As we elected to use the modified retrospective method, prior periods presented have not been restated to reflect the impact of adoption. Reclassifications have been made where noted for conforming presentation only (see Notes 1(p) and 14 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report).\nOur business outlook is affected by both increasing complexity in the global security environment and continuing worldwide economic pressures. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on delivering excellent performance to our customers, driving improvements and efficiencies across our operations, and creating value through the enhancement and expansion of our business.\nSome of the significant challenges we face are as follows: dependence upon U.S. government programs and contracts, future reductions or changes in U.S. government spending in our markets, successful implementation of our cost reduction plans, environmental matters, capital structure, underfunded retirement benefit plans, and information technology and cyber security.\nMajor Customers\nThe principal end user customers of our products and technology are primarily agencies of the U.S. government. Since a majority of our sales are, directly or indirectly, to the U.S. government, funding for the purchase of our products and services generally follows trends in U.S. aerospace and defense spending. However, individual U.S. government agencies, which include the military services, NASA, the Missile Defense Agency, and the prime contractors that serve these agencies, exercise independent purchasing power within \"budget top-line\" limits. Therefore, sales to the U.S. government are not regarded as sales to one customer, but rather each contracting agency is viewed as a separate customer.\nThe following table summarizes net sales to the U.S. government and its agencies, including net sales to significant customers disclosed below: \nThe following table summarizes net sales by principal end user in 2018:\n\nThe following table summarizes the percentages of net sales for significant programs, all of which are included in the U.S. government sales and are comprised of multiple contracts:\n\nThe following table summarizes customers that represented more than 10% of net sales, each of which involves sales of several product lines and programs: \nIndustry Update\nInformation concerning our industry appears in Part I, Item 1. Business under the caption \"Industry Overview.\"\nCompetitive Improvement Program\nDuring 2015, we initiated Phase I of our CIP comprised of activities and initiatives aimed at reducing costs in order for us to continue to compete successfully. Phase I is comprised of three major components: (i) facilities optimization and footprint reduction; (ii) product affordability; and (iii) reduced administrative and overhead costs. On April 6, 2017, the Board of Directors approved Phase II of our previously announced CIP. Pursuant to Phase II, we expanded CIP and further consolidated our Sacramento, California, and Gainesville, Virginia sites, while centralizing and expanding our existing presence in Huntsville, Alabama. When fully implemented, we anticipate that the CIP will result in annual costs that are $230 million below levels anticipated prior to CIP.\nWe currently estimate that we will incur restructuring and related costs of the Phase I and II programs of approximately $210.0 million (including approximately $60.5 million of capital expenditures). Our current estimate is down from the initial estimate of $235.0 million primarily due to efficiencies in program transitions and lower than expected employee costs. We have incurred $131.4 million of such costs through December 31, 2018, including $48.1 million in capital expenditures.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur current and former business operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes. See Notes 8(c) and 8(d) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report and \"Environmental Matters\" below for summary of our environmental reserve activity.\nCapital Structure\nWe have a substantial amount of debt for which we are required to make interest and principal payments. Interest on long-term financing is not a recoverable cost under our U.S. government contracts. As of December 31, 2018, we had $625.4 million of debt outstanding. In 2018, we entered into an industrial bond transaction with a subsidiary to realize property tax savings.\nRetirement Benefits\nAs of the last measurement date at December 31, 2018, the pension assets, projected benefit obligations, and unfunded pension obligation were $894.8 million, $1,288.7 million, and $393.9 million, respectively. We estimate that 82% of our unfunded pension obligation as of December 31, 2018, is related to our U.S. government contracting business, Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nOn September 10, 2018, we made a discretionary contribution of 2.7 million treasury stock, or $95.0 million, of our common stock to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. This voluntary contribution will help address the current underfunding of the tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. This contribution was tax deductible in the current period and will be used as a pre-funding credit.\nWe expect to make cash contributions of approximately $37.0 million to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2019. We generally are able to recover cash contributions related to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan as allowable costs on our U.S. government contracts, but there can be differences between when we contribute cash to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan under pension funding rules and recover it under CAS.\nInformation Technology and Cyber Security\nWe routinely experience cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to our sensitive information, as do our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and other partners. In 2017, we outsourced certain information technology and cyber security functions to third-party contractors in order to take advantage of advanced cyber security technologies. The visibility provided by the additional cyber security technologies identified vulnerabilities and resulted in additional costs to remediate throughout 2018. The transition to the outsourced provider impacted our level of control over the performance and delivery of such service to the business.\nWe continue to assess our information technology systems and are engaged in cooperative efforts with our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions.\nResults of Operations:\nNet Sales:\n\n* Primary reason for change. Net sales were impacted by the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. The primary impact of the new guidance was a change in the timing of revenue recognition on certain long-term contracts. Under this new guidance, we discontinued the use of the unit-of-delivery method on certain customer contracts and re-measured the performance obligations using the cost-to-cost method. Net sales in 2018 would have been $1,910.0 million under the previous revenue recognition guidance which is $32.8 million higher than net sales reported in 2017, resulting from an increase of $126.0 million in defense programs primarily driven by increased deliveries on the Standard Missile and PAC-3 programs. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $94.6 million in space programs primarily driven by cost growth and performance issues on the Commercial Crew Development program and lower deliveries on the Atlas V program as this program winds down. The Atlas V program contributed sales of $42.6 million under the new revenue recognition guidance in 2018, and sales of $89.1 million under the previous revenue recognition guidance in 2018.\n** Primary reason for change. The increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase of $158.0 million in space programs primarily driven by the following (i) the RS-25 program development and integration effort in support of the SLS development program; (ii) increased development effort and volume on the Commercial Crew Development program; and (iii) increased deliveries on the Atlas V program. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $36.5 million in defense programs primarily driven by the timing of deliveries on the THAAD and Standard Missile programs partially offset by the net sales generated from the Coleman Aerospace acquisition. Further, as a result of the 2016 calendar, Aerojet Rocketdyne had 53 weeks of operations in 2016 compared with 52 weeks of operations in 2017. The additional week of operations, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 and accounted for $32.2 million in additional net sales, is included in the above discussion of program changes.\nCost of Sales (exclusive of items shown separately below):\n\n* Primary reason for change. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the following: (i) risk retirements on the RS-68 program, (ii) favorable overhead rate performance, and (iii) cost growth and manufacturing inefficiencies in 2017 on electric propulsion contracts. These factors were partially offset by cost growth and performance issues in the current period on the Commercial Crew Development program and favorable contract performance on the THAAD program in 2017 as a result of risk retirements and cost reductions. The same factors drove the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales under the previous revenue recognition guidance.\n** Primary reason for change. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to favorable contract performance on numerous programs as a result of overhead cost reductions and reduced program risks, most notably on the THAAD program, partially offset by cost growth and manufacturing inefficiencies in 2017 on electric propulsion contracts.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense (\"SG&A\"): \n* Primary reason for change. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily driven by (i) a decrease of $1.5 million in stock-based compensation primarily as a result of decreases in the fair value of the stock appreciation rights in the current period and accelerated vesting of stock awards to a former executive officer in 2017 and (ii) a decrease in legal and professional services expenses.\n** Primary reason for change. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily driven by an increase of $9.1 million in stock-based compensation primarily as a result of increases in the fair value of stock appreciation rights, the accelerated vesting of stock awards to a former executive officer, and the August 2016 stock award granted to the Executive Chairman that vested according to the attainment of share prices ranging from $22 per share to $27 per share of our common stock.\nDepreciation and Amortization:\n\n* Primary reason for change. Depreciation and amortization expense did not change significantly in 2018 compared with 2017.\n** Primary reason for change. The increase in depreciation expense was primarily the result of increased accelerated depreciation associated with changes in the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets and capital projects being placed in service to support the cost saving initiatives of the CIP.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net and Loss On Debt:\n\n* Primary reason for change. The increase in other income, net was primarily due to a one-time benefit of $43.0 million in environmental remediation provision adjustments as a result of reaching a determination with the U.S. government that certain environmental expenditures are reimbursable under the Global Settlement (see discussion of \"Environmental Matters\" below).\n** Primary reason for change. The decrease in other expense, net was primarily due to a decrease of $35.5 million in unusual items (discussed below) and a decrease of $10.1 in environmental remediation expenses (see discussion of \"Environmental Matters\" below).\nThe following table summarizes unusual items, comprised of a component of other (income) expense, net and loss on debt in the consolidated statements of operations:\n\n________\n(1) Operating expense (income)\n(2) Non-operating expense\n2018 Activity:\nWe recorded a charge of $0.2 million associated with an amendment to the Senior Credit Facility.\n2017 Activity:\nWe recorded $2.0 million of realized gains, net of interest associated with the failure to register with the SEC the issuance of certain of our common shares under the defined contribution 401(k) employee benefit plan. On May 30, 2017, we made a registered rescission offer to buy back unregistered shares from eligible Plan participants at the original purchase price plus interest, or to reimburse eligible Plan participants for losses they may have incurred if their shares had been sold. The actual cost of the registered rescission offer was less than the previously estimated costs. The registered rescission offer expired on June 30, 2017, and settlement payments of $3.5 million under the offer were completed in the third quarter of 2017.\nWe recorded $1.0 million of costs related to the acquisition of Coleman Aerospace from L3 Technologies, Inc.\n2016 Activity:\nOn July 18, 2016, we redeemed $460.0 million principal amount of our 7.125% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes (\"7 1/8% Notes\"), representing all of the outstanding 7 1/8% Notes, at a redemption price equal to 105.344% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We incurred a pre-tax charge of $34.1 million in 2016 associated with the extinguishment of the 7 1/8% Notes. The $34.1 million pre-tax charge was the result of the $24.6 million paid in excess of the par value and $9.5 million associated with the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.\nWe retired $13.0 million principal amount of our delayed draw term loan resulting in a loss of $0.3 million.\nWe recorded a charge of $0.1 million associated with an amendment to the Senior Credit Facility.\nInterest Income:\n\n* Primary reason for change. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average cash balances and interest rates for both period comparisons.\nInterest Expense:\n\n* Primary reason for change. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to a higher variable interest rate on our Senior Credit Facility partially offset by a lower principal balance on the Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility variable interest rate was 4.52% as of December 31, 2018, compared with 3.82% as of December 31, 2017.\n** Primary reason for change. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the retirement of the principal amount of our delayed draw term loan in the first quarter of 2016, the redemption of the 7 1/8% Notes in the third quarter of 2016, and the conversion of 41/16% Convertible Subordinated Debentures to common shares. The decrease was partially offset by interest expense on the debt incurred on the Senior Credit Facility at a variable interest rate of 3.82% as of December 31, 2017, and the issuance of the 2\u00bc% Notes in December 2016 at an effective interest rate of 5.8%.\nIncome Tax Provision: \nIn 2018, our effective tax rate was 27.2%. Our effective tax rate differed from the 21% statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to an increase from state income taxes and unfavorable adjustments to uncertain tax positions partially offset by R&D credits.\nIn 2017, our effective tax rate was 110.6%. Our effective tax rate differed from the 35.0% statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the change in the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% under Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). The one time reduction to deferred tax assets due to the Tax Act was $64.6 million or a 74.4% increase to the effective tax rate. Before applying the effects of the Tax Act, the effective tax rate was 36.2%. This rate differs from the 35% federal income tax rate due to an increase from state income taxes partially offset by R&D credits and favorable adjustments to uncertain tax positions.\nIn 2016, the income tax provision recorded differs from the expected tax that would be calculated by applying the federal statutory rate to our income before income taxes primarily due to the impacts from state income taxes, and certain expenditures which are permanently not deductible for tax purposes, partially offset by the impact of R&D credits.\nWe recorded an initial estimate of our current tax payable of $127.7 million during the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, based on our best estimate of the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance and the enactment of certain provisions of tax reform under the Tax Act, both effective on January 1, 2018. Subsequently, guidance was issued by federal taxing authorities providing clarification on provisions within the Tax Act. This new clarification allows us to spread the impact of adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance over a four-year period, reducing the single-year impact in 2018. The current tax payable of $19.8 million as of December 31, 2018, reflects this reduction as well as other refinements to the estimated impacts from both the new revenue recognition guidance and the Tax Act.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the liability for uncertain income tax positions was $5.9 million. Due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid.\nRetirement Benefit Expense:\n\n* Primary reason for change. The decrease in retirement benefits expense was primarily due to better than expected investment returns on our pension plan assets and lower interest costs on the benefit obligation.\nWe estimate that our retirement benefits expense will be approximately $26 million in 2019.\nSee \"Critical Accounting Policies - Retirement Benefit Plans\" for more information about our accounting practices with respect to retirement benefits.\nOperating Segment Information:\nWe evaluate our operating segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment performance. Segment performance represents net sales less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for unusual items relating to the segment. Excluded from segment performance are: corporate income and expenses, interest expense, interest income, income taxes, legacy income or expenses, and unusual items not related to the segment. We believe that segment performance provides information useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance. In addition, we provide the Non-GAAP financial measure of our operational performance called segment performance before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, and segment unusual items. We believe the exclusion of the items listed above permits an evaluation and a comparison of results for ongoing business operations, and it is on this basis that management internally assesses operational performance.\nAerospace and Defense Segment\n\nNet sales were impacted by the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. The primary impact of the new guidance was a change in the timing of revenue recognition on certain long-term contracts. Under this new guidance, we discontinued the use of the unit-of-delivery method on certain customer contracts and re-measured the performance obligations using the cost-to-cost method.\nSegment performance during 2018 was significantly impacted by a one-time benefit of $43.0 million as a result of reaching a determination with the U.S. government that certain environmental expenditures are reimbursable under the Global Settlement. See Note 8(d) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.\n* Primary reason for change. Net sales in 2018 would have been $1,902.2 million under the previous revenue recognition guidance which is $31.4 million higher than net sales reported in 2017, resulting from an increase of $126.0 million in defense programs primarily driven by increased deliveries on the Standard Missile and PAC-3 programs. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $94.6 million in space programs primarily driven by cost growth and performance issues on the Commercial Crew Development program and lower deliveries on the Atlas V program as this program winds down. The Atlas V program contributed sales of $42.6 million under the new revenue recognition guidance in 2018, and sales of $89.1 million under the previous revenue recognition guidance in 2018.\nThe increase in the segment margin before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, net and unusual items was primarily due to the following: (i) risk retirements on the RS-68 program, (ii) favorable overhead rate performance, and (iii) cost growth and manufacturing inefficiencies in 2017 on electric propulsion contracts. These factors were partially offset by cost growth and performance issues in the current period on the Commercial Crew Development program and favorable contract performance on the THAAD program in 2017 as a result of risk retirements and cost reductions.\nDuring 2018, we had $59.1 million of favorable changes in contract estimates on operating results before income taxes compared with favorable changes of $37.2 million during 2017.\n** Primary reason for change. The increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase of $158.0 million in space programs primarily driven by the following (i) the RS-25 program development and integration effort in support of the SLS development program; (ii) increased development effort and volume on the Commercial Crew Development program; and (iii) increased deliveries on the Atlas V program. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $36.5 million in defense programs primarily driven by the timing of deliveries on the THAAD and Standard Missile programs partially offset by the net sales generated from the Coleman Aerospace acquisition. Further, as a result of the 2016 calendar, Aerojet Rocketdyne had 53 weeks of operations in 2016 compared with 52 weeks of operations in 2017. The additional week of operations, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 and accounted for $32.2 million in additional net sales, is included in the above discussion of program changes.\nSegment margin before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, net, and unusual items in 2017 compared with 2016 was up 30 basis points. Items that had a significant impact were favorable contract performance on numerous programs as a result of overhead cost reductions and reduced program risks, most notably on the THAAD program, partially offset by cost growth and manufacturing inefficiencies in 2017 on electric propulsion contracts.\nReal Estate Segment\n\nIn 2018, we recognized net sales of $1.4 million from a land sale of 57 acres of the Sacramento Land. During 2017 and 2016, net sales and segment performance consisted primarily of rental property operations.\nBacklog:\nAs of December 31, 2018, our total remaining performance obligations, also referred to as backlog, totaled $4.1 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 45%, or $1.8 billion, of the remaining performance obligations as sales over the next twelve months, an additional 29% the following twelve months, and 26% thereafter. The following table summarizes backlog: \nOur adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance accelerated the timing of revenue recognition on some of our contracts which resulted in a $0.6 billion reduction in our backlog as of December 31, 2017. Total backlog includes both funded backlog (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated). Indefinite delivery and quantity contracts and unexercised options are not reported in total backlog. Backlog is subject to funding delays or program restructurings/cancellations which are beyond our control.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\nIn addition to segment performance (discussed above), we provide the Non-GAAP financial measures of our performance called Adjusted EBITDAP, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS. We use these metrics to measure our operating and total Company performance. We believe that for management and investors to effectively compare core performance from period to period, the metrics should exclude items that are not indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations such as retirement benefits (pension and postretirement benefits), significant non-cash expenses, the impacts of financing decisions on earnings, and items incurred outside the ordinary, on-going and customary course of our business. Accordingly, we define Adjusted EBITDAP as GAAP net income (loss) adjusted to exclude interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, retirement benefits net of amounts that are recoverable under our U.S. government contracts, and unusual items which we do not believe are reflective of such ordinary, on-going and customary activities. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS exclude retirement benefits net of amounts that are recoverable under our U.S. government contracts and unusual items which we do not believe are reflective of such ordinary, on-going and customary activities. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income (loss) or diluted EPS as determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\n_________\n(1) The income tax impact is calculated using the federal and state statutory rates in the corresponding year.\nWe also provide the Non-GAAP financial measure of Free Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow, a Non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to cash flows from operations presented in accordance with GAAP. We use Free Cash Flow, both in presenting our results to stakeholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluation and management of the business. Management believes that this financial measure is useful because it provides supplemental information to assist investors in viewing the business using the same tools that management uses to evaluate progress in achieving our goals (including under our annual cash and long-term compensation\nincentive plans). The following table summarizes Free Cash Flow: \n_________\n(1) Free Cash Flow, a Non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures.\nBecause our method for calculating these Non-GAAP measures may differ from other companies' methods, the Non-GAAP measures presented above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. These measures are not recognized in accordance with GAAP, and we do not intend for this information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures.\nEnvironmental Matters:\nOur policy is to conduct our businesses with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We devote a significant amount of resources and management attention to environmental matters and actively manage our ongoing processes to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We are involved in the remediation of environmental conditions that resulted from generally accepted manufacturing and disposal practices at certain plants in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, we have been designated a PRP with other companies at third party sites undergoing investigation and remediation.\nEstimating environmental remediation costs is difficult due to the significant uncertainties inherent in these activities, including the extent of remediation required, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, evolving technologies and the long period of time over which most remediation efforts take place. We:\n \u2022 accrue for costs associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and when our proportionate share of the costs can be reasonably estimated; and \n \u2022 record related estimated recoveries when such recoveries are deemed probable.  In addition to the costs associated with environmental remediation discussed above, we incur expenditures for recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances or pollutants in ongoing operations which were immaterial for 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nThe following table summarizes our recoverable amounts, environmental reserves, and range of liability, as of December 31, 2018: \n_____\n (1) Excludes the receivable from Northrop of $58.5 million as of December 31, 2018, related to environmental costs already paid (and therefore not reserved) by us in prior years and reimbursable under our agreement with Northrop.  Environmental Reserves\nWe review on a quarterly basis estimated future remediation costs and have an established practice of estimating environmental remediation costs over a fifteen year period, except for those environmental remediation costs with a specific contractual term. Environmental liabilities at the BPOU site are currently estimated through the term of the new project agreement, which expires in May 2027. As the period for which estimated environmental remediation costs lengthens, the reliability of such estimates decreases. These estimates consider the investigative work and analysis of engineers, outside environmental consultants, and the advice of legal staff regarding the status and anticipated results of various administrative and legal proceedings. In most cases, only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated. In establishing our reserves, the most probable estimate is used when determinable; otherwise, the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Accordingly, such estimates can change as we periodically evaluate these estimates when new information becomes available. We cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will affect the estimated liability accrued. The timing of payment for estimated future environmental costs is influenced by a number of factors, such as the regulatory approval process and the time required designing, constructing, and implementing the remedy.\nThe following tables summarizes our environmental reserve activity:\n\nThe $23.3 million of environmental reserve additions in 2018 was primarily due to the following items: (i) $8.8 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $4.6 million of regulatory oversight costs and fees; (iii) $3.8 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (iv) $2.2 million of sampling analysis costs; and (v) $3.9 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nThe $31.3 million of environmental reserve additions in 2017 was primarily due to the following items: (i) $13.4 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $6.7 million of additional estimated costs related to the Camden, Arkansas site; (iii) $2.3 million associated with water replacement; and (iv) $8.9 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nThe $87.4 million of environmental reserve additions in 2016 was primarily due to the following items: (i) in 2016, we reached a decision with the U.S. government on the treatment of certain utility costs related to the Sacramento site resulting in a reserve increase of $59.4 million for the estimated impact over the current period and a fifteen year reserve period; (ii) $10.4 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (iii) $5.9 million of remediation related to inactive test sites and landfill clean-up; (iv) $2.7 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; and (v) $9.0 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nThe effect of the final resolution of environmental matters and our obligations for environmental remediation and compliance cannot be accurately predicted due to the uncertainty concerning both the amount and timing of future expenditures and due to regulatory or technological changes. We continue our efforts to mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of claims for recoveries from our insurance carriers and other PRPs and continued investigation of new and more cost effective remediation alternatives and associated technologies.\nEstimated Recoveries\nEnvironmental remediation costs are primarily incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these costs are recoverable from our contracts with the U.S. government. We currently estimate approximately 12% of our future Aerospace and Defense segment environmental remediation costs will not likely be reimbursable and are expensed.\nAllowable environmental remediation costs are charged to our contracts as the costs are incurred. Because these costs are recovered through forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet Rocketdyne to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on Aerojet Rocketdyne's sustained business volume from U.S. government contracts and programs.\nWhile we are currently seeking an arrangement with the U.S. government to recover environmental expenditures in excess of the reimbursement ceiling identified in the Global Settlement, there can be no assurances that such a recovery will be obtained, or if not obtained, that such unreimbursed environmental expenditures will not have a materially adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the current and non-current recoverable amounts from the U.S. government and Northrop: \n_____\n(1) The adjustment in 2018 was primarily a result of reaching a determination with the U.S. government that certain environmental expenditures are reimbursable under the Global Settlement. See Note 8(d) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.\nThe activity for recoveries is commensurate with the activity associated with the environmental reserve activity.\nEnvironmental reserves and recoveries impact on the consolidated statements of operations\nThe expenses associated with adjustments to the environmental reserves are recorded as a component of other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The following table summarizes the impact of environmental reserves and recoveries to the consolidated statements of operations: \nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements:\nSee Note 1(v) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for information relating to our discussion of the effects of recent accounting pronouncements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources:\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities\nThe following table summarizes the change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash:\n\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nThe $39.9 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily driven by improved operating results and a reduction of $39.7 million in retirement benefit cash funding partially offset by cash usage from working capital. The increased cash usage from working capital was primarily due to (i) an increase of $47.3 million in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of cash receipts; (ii) an increase of $38.7 million in net income tax payments; and (iii) a decrease of $39.4 million in accounts payable due to vendor payment schedules. These factors were partially offset by improved cash flow from contracts of $39.7 million primarily due to the timing of contract performance payments.\nThe $54.1 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily driven by improved operating results and cash generation from working capital partially offset by $43.0 million of increased retirement benefit funding. The improved cash generation from working capital was primarily due to (i) a decrease in inventories on the Atlas V and PAC-3 contracts and (ii) an increase in customer advances partially offset by an increase in accounts receivables due to the timing of sales and milestone billings on a space program contract.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nDuring 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had capital expenditures of $43.2 million, $29.4 million, and $47.6 million. The higher capital expenditures in 2016 compared with 2018 and 2017 was primarily related to construction projects associated with supporting our CIP.\nDuring the 2018, we received insurance proceeds of $1.9 million and received net proceeds of $20.4 million in marketable securities.\nDuring 2017, we purchased Coleman Aerospace for $17.0 million and we made a net cash investment of $20.0 million in marketable securities.\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nDuring 2018, we had debt cash payments of $25.3 million. During 2017, we had debt cash payments of $20.0 million. During 2016, we had $700.6 million in debt cash payments and borrowings of $800.0 million.\nDebt Activity\nThe following table summarizes our debt principal activity: \nOn September 20, 2018, we amended our Senior Credit Facility to a $1.0 billion commitment (see Note 6 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report).\nOutlook\nShort-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of recurring operating expenses, including but not limited to costs related to our capital and environmental expenditures, company-funded R&D expenditures, debt service requirements, and retirement benefit plans. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and availability under the Senior Credit Facility coupled with cash generated from our future operations will provide sufficient funds to meet our operating plan for the next twelve months. The operating plan for this period provides for full operation of our businesses, including interest and debt payments. As of December 31, 2018, we had $735.3 million of cash and cash equivalents as well as $620.6 million of available borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. Based on our existing debt agreements, we were in compliance with our financial and non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2018. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived by the lenders, could result in the acceleration of the Senior Credit Facility and 2\u00bc% Notes. In addition, our failure to pay principal and interest when due is a default under the Senior Credit Facility, and in certain cases, would cause a cross default on the 2\u00bc% Notes.\nWe are committed to a cash management strategy that maintains liquidity to adequately support the operation of the business, our growth strategy and to withstand unanticipated business volatility. Our cash management strategy includes maintaining the flexibility to pay down debt and/or repurchase shares depending on economic and other conditions. In connection with the implementation of our cash management strategy, our management may seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise if we believe that it is in our best interests. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nPotential future acquisitions depend, in part, on the availability of financial resources at an acceptable cost of capital. We expect to utilize cash on hand and cash generated by operations, as well as cash available under our Senior Credit Facility, which may involve renegotiation of credit limits to finance any future acquisitions. Other sources of capital could include the issuance of common and/or preferred stock, and the placement of debt. We periodically evaluate capital markets and may access such markets when circumstances appear favorable. We believe that sufficient capital resources will be available from one or several of these sources to finance any future acquisitions. However, no assurances can be made that acceptable financing will be available, or that acceptable acquisition candidates will be identified, or that any such acquisitions will be accretive to earnings.\nAs disclosed in Notes 8(b) and 8(c) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report, we have exposure for certain legal and environmental matters. We believe that it is currently not possible to estimate the impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of certain of these matters will have on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nMajor factors that could adversely impact our forecasted operating cash flows and our financial condition are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition, our liquidity and financial condition will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates on the portion of debt that bears interest at variable interest rates.\nContractual Obligations:\nWe have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of debt obligations, operating leases, certain other liabilities, and other commitments. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:  ", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in Item 8 of this Report, the risk factors appearing in Item 1A of this Report, and the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements appearing at the beginning of Item 1 of this Report.\nOverview\nA summary of the significant financial highlights for 2018, which management uses to evaluate our operating performance and financial condition, is presented below.\n \u2022 Net sales for 2018 totaled $1,895.9 million compared with $1,877.2 million for 2017. \n \u2022 Net income for 2018 was $137.3 million, or $1.75 diluted income per share (\"EPS\"), compared with net loss of $(9.2) million, or $(0.13) diluted EPS for 2017. \n \u2022 Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP measure*) for 2018 was $151.5 million, or $1.93 Adjusted EPS (Non-GAAP measure*), compared with $76.0 million, or $1.02 Adjusted EPS for 2017. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDAP (Non-GAAP measure*) for 2018 was $304.9 million compared with $222.9 million for 2017. \n \u2022 Segment performance before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, net, and unusual items (Non-GAAP measure*) was $236.2 million for 2018, compared with $202.9 million for 2017. \n \u2022 Cash provided by operating activities in 2018 totaled $252.7 million compared with $212.8 million in 2017. \n \u2022 Free cash flow (Non-GAAP measure*) in 2018 totaled $209.5 million compared with $183.4 million in 2017. \n \u2022 Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue recognition guidance. Consistent with the standard, net assets increased by $37.6 million and $578.0 million of net sales were recognized in the cumulative effect at January 1, 2018, with a corresponding reduction to backlog. \n \u2022 Total backlog as of December 31, 2018, was $4.1 billion compared with $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2017.  _________\n* We provide Non-GAAP measures as a supplement to financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is presented later in the Management's Discussion and Analysis under the heading \"Operating Segment Information\" and \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The amendments are based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method, with the cumulative effect recognized as of January 1, 2018. All applicable amounts and disclosures for 2018 reflect the impact of adoption. As we elected to use the modified retrospective method, prior periods presented have not been restated to reflect the impact of adoption. Reclassifications have been made where noted for conforming presentation only (see Notes 1(p) and 14 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report).\nOur business outlook is affected by both increasing complexity in the global security environment and continuing worldwide economic pressures. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on delivering excellent performance to our customers, driving improvements and efficiencies across our operations, and creating value through the enhancement and expansion of our business.\nSome of the significant challenges we face are as follows: dependence upon U.S. government programs and contracts, future reductions or changes in U.S. government spending in our markets, successful implementation of our cost reduction plans, environmental matters, capital structure, underfunded retirement benefit plans, and information technology and cyber security.\nMajor Customers\nThe principal end user customers of our products and technology are primarily agencies of the U.S. government. Since a majority of our sales are, directly or indirectly, to the U.S. government, funding for the purchase of our products and services generally follows trends in U.S. aerospace and defense spending. However, individual U.S. government agencies, which include the military services, NASA, the Missile Defense Agency, and the prime contractors that serve these agencies, exercise independent purchasing power within \"budget top-line\" limits. Therefore, sales to the U.S. government are not regarded as sales to one customer, but rather each contracting agency is viewed as a separate customer.\nThe following table summarizes net sales to the U.S. government and its agencies, including net sales to significant customers disclosed below: Table 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>Percentage of Net\nSales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes net sales by principal end user in 2018:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NASA\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Air Force\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Army\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Missile Defense Agency\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Navy\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other U.S. government\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. government customers\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other customers\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the percentages of net sales for significant programs, all of which are included in the U.S. government sales and are comprised of multiple contracts:\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RS-25 program\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standard Missile program\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>THAAD program\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes customers that represented more than 10% of net sales, each of which involves sales of several product lines and programs: Table 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lockheed Martin\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Raytheon\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NASA\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ULA\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndustry Update\nInformation concerning our industry appears in Part I, Item 1. Business under the caption \"Industry Overview.\"\nCompetitive Improvement Program\nDuring 2015, we initiated Phase I of our CIP comprised of activities and initiatives aimed at reducing costs in order for us to continue to compete successfully. Phase I is comprised of three major components: (i) facilities optimization and footprint reduction; (ii) product affordability; and (iii) reduced administrative and overhead costs. On April 6, 2017, the Board of Directors approved Phase II of our previously announced CIP. Pursuant to Phase II, we expanded CIP and further consolidated our Sacramento, California, and Gainesville, Virginia sites, while centralizing and expanding our existing presence in Huntsville, Alabama. When fully implemented, we anticipate that the CIP will result in annual costs that are $230 million below levels anticipated prior to CIP.\nWe currently estimate that we will incur restructuring and related costs of the Phase I and II programs of approximately $210.0 million (including approximately $60.5 million of capital expenditures). Our current estimate is down from the initial estimate of $235.0 million primarily due to efficiencies in program transitions and lower than expected employee costs. We have incurred $131.4 million of such costs through December 31, 2018, including $48.1 million in capital expenditures.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur current and former business operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes. See Notes 8(c) and 8(d) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report and \"Environmental Matters\" below for summary of our environmental reserve activity.\nCapital Structure\nWe have a substantial amount of debt for which we are required to make interest and principal payments. Interest on long-term financing is not a recoverable cost under our U.S. government contracts. As of December 31, 2018, we had $625.4 million of debt outstanding. In 2018, we entered into an industrial bond transaction with a subsidiary to realize property tax savings.\nRetirement Benefits\nAs of the last measurement date at December 31, 2018, the pension assets, projected benefit obligations, and unfunded pension obligation were $894.8 million, $1,288.7 million, and $393.9 million, respectively. We estimate that 82% of our unfunded pension obligation as of December 31, 2018, is related to our U.S. government contracting business, Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nOn September 10, 2018, we made a discretionary contribution of 2.7 million treasury stock, or $95.0 million, of our common stock to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. This voluntary contribution will help address the current underfunding of the tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. This contribution was tax deductible in the current period and will be used as a pre-funding credit.\nWe expect to make cash contributions of approximately $37.0 million to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2019. We generally are able to recover cash contributions related to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan as allowable costs on our U.S. government contracts, but there can be differences between when we contribute cash to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan under pension funding rules and recover it under CAS.\nInformation Technology and Cyber Security\nWe routinely experience cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to our sensitive information, as do our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and other partners. In 2017, we outsourced certain information technology and cyber security functions to third-party contractors in order to take advantage of advanced cyber security technologies. The visibility provided by the additional cyber security technologies identified vulnerabilities and resulted in additional costs to remediate throughout 2018. The transition to the outsourced provider impacted our level of control over the performance and delivery of such service to the business.\nWe continue to assess our information technology systems and are engaged in cooperative efforts with our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions.\nResults of Operations:\nNet Sales:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change**\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales:\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,895.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,877.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,877.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,761.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Primary reason for change. Net sales were impacted by the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. The primary impact of the new guidance was a change in the timing of revenue recognition on certain long-term contracts. Under this new guidance, we discontinued the use of the unit-of-delivery method on certain customer contracts and re-measured the performance obligations using the cost-to-cost method. Net sales in 2018 would have been $1,910.0 million under the previous revenue recognition guidance which is $32.8 million higher than net sales reported in 2017, resulting from an increase of $126.0 million in defense programs primarily driven by increased deliveries on the Standard Missile and PAC-3 programs. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $94.6 million in space programs primarily driven by cost growth and performance issues on the Commercial Crew Development program and lower deliveries on the Atlas V program as this program winds down. The Atlas V program contributed sales of $42.6 million under the new revenue recognition guidance in 2018, and sales of $89.1 million under the previous revenue recognition guidance in 2018.\n** Primary reason for change. The increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase of $158.0 million in space programs primarily driven by the following (i) the RS-25 program development and integration effort in support of the SLS development program; (ii) increased development effort and volume on the Commercial Crew Development program; and (iii) increased deliveries on the Atlas V program. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $36.5 million in defense programs primarily driven by the timing of deliveries on the THAAD and Standard Missile programs partially offset by the net sales generated from the Coleman Aerospace acquisition. Further, as a result of the 2016 calendar, Aerojet Rocketdyne had 53 weeks of operations in 2016 compared with 52 weeks of operations in 2017. The additional week of operations, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 and accounted for $32.2 million in additional net sales, is included in the above discussion of program changes.\nCost of Sales (exclusive of items shown separately below):\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change**\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions, except percentage amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,549.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,562.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,562.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,477.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales\n</td> <td>81.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Primary reason for change. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the following: (i) risk retirements on the RS-68 program, (ii) favorable overhead rate performance, and (iii) cost growth and manufacturing inefficiencies in 2017 on electric propulsion contracts. These factors were partially offset by cost growth and performance issues in the current period on the Commercial Crew Development program and favorable contract performance on the THAAD program in 2017 as a result of risk retirements and cost reductions. The same factors drove the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales under the previous revenue recognition guidance.\n** Primary reason for change. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to favorable contract performance on numerous programs as a result of overhead cost reductions and reduced program risks, most notably on the THAAD program, partially offset by cost growth and manufacturing inefficiencies in 2017 on electric propulsion contracts.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense (\"SG&A\"): Table 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change**\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions, except percentage amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of SG&A:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A excluding stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales excluding stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Primary reason for change.

Our effective tax rate differed from the 21% statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to an increase from state income taxes and unfavorable adjustments to uncertain tax positions partially offset by R&D credits.\nIn 2017, our effective tax rate was 110.6%. Our effective tax rate differed from the 35.0% statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the change in the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% under Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). The one time reduction to deferred tax assets due to the Tax Act was $64.6 million or a 74.4% increase to the effective tax rate. Before applying the effects of the Tax Act, the effective tax rate was 36.2%. This rate differs from the 35% federal income tax rate due to an increase from state income taxes partially offset by R&D credits and favorable adjustments to uncertain tax positions.\nIn 2016, the income tax provision recorded differs from the expected tax that would be calculated by applying the federal statutory rate to our income before income taxes primarily due to the impacts from state income taxes, and certain expenditures which are permanently not deductible for tax purposes, partially offset by the impact of R&D credits.\nWe recorded an initial estimate of our current tax payable of $127.7 million during the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, based on our best estimate of the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance and the enactment of certain provisions of tax reform under the Tax Act, both effective on January 1, 2018. Subsequently, guidance was issued by federal taxing authorities providing clarification on provisions within the Tax Act. This new clarification allows us to spread the impact of adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance over a four-year period, reducing the single-year impact in 2018. The current tax payable of $19.8 million as of December 31, 2018, reflects this reduction as well as other refinements to the estimated impacts from both the new revenue recognition guidance and the Tax Act.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the liability for uncertain income tax positions was $5.9 million. Due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid.\nRetirement Benefit Expense:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of retirement benefits expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest cost on benefit obligation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumed return on assets\n</td> <td>(60.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of prior service credits\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of net losses\n</td> <td>66.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retirement benefits expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Primary reason for change. The decrease in retirement benefits expense was primarily due to better than expected investment returns on our pension plan assets and lower interest costs on the benefit obligation.\nWe estimate that our retirement benefits expense will be approximately $26 million in 2019.\nSee \"Critical Accounting Policies - Retirement Benefit Plans\" for more information about our accounting practices with respect to retirement benefits.\nOperating Segment Information:\nWe evaluate our operating segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment performance. Segment performance represents net sales less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for unusual items relating to the segment. Excluded from segment performance are: corporate income and expenses, interest expense, interest income, income taxes, legacy income or expenses, and unusual items not related to the segment. We believe that segment performance provides information useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance. In addition, we provide the Non-GAAP financial measure of our operational performance called segment performance before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, and segment unusual items. We believe the exclusion of the items listed above permits an evaluation and a comparison of results for ongoing business operations, and it is on this basis that management internally assesses operational performance.\nAerospace and Defense Segment\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change**\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions, except percentage amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,888.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,870.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,870.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,753.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment performance\n</td> <td>264.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment margin\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment margin before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, net, and unusual items (Non-GAAP measure)\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of segment performance:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerospace and Defense before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, net, and unusual items (Non-GAAP measure)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>233.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental remediation provision adjustments\n</td> <td>37.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP/CAS retirement benefits expense difference\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unusual items\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerospace and Defense total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>264.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales were impacted by the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. The primary impact of the new guidance was a change in the timing of revenue recognition on certain long-term contracts. Under this new guidance, we discontinued the use of the unit-of-delivery method on certain customer contracts and re-measured the performance obligations using the cost-to-cost method.\nSegment performance during 2018 was significantly impacted by a one-time benefit of $43.0 million as a result of reaching a determination with the U.S. government that certain environmental expenditures are reimbursable under the Global Settlement. See Note 8(d) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.\n* Primary reason for change. Net sales in 2018 would have been $1,902.2 million under the previous revenue recognition guidance which is $31.4 million higher than net sales reported in 2017, resulting from an increase of $126.0 million in defense programs primarily driven by increased deliveries on the Standard Missile and PAC-3 programs. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $94.6 million in space programs primarily driven by cost growth and performance issues on the Commercial Crew Development program and lower deliveries on the Atlas V program as this program winds down. The Atlas V program contributed sales of $42.6 million under the new revenue recognition guidance in 2018, and sales of $89.1 million under the previous revenue recognition guidance in 2018.\nThe increase in the segment margin before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, net and unusual items was primarily due to the following: (i) risk retirements on the RS-68 program, (ii) favorable overhead rate performance, and (iii) cost growth and manufacturing inefficiencies in 2017 on electric propulsion contracts. These factors were partially offset by cost growth and performance issues in the current period on the Commercial Crew Development program and favorable contract performance on the THAAD program in 2017 as a result of risk retirements and cost reductions.\nDuring 2018, we had $59.1 million of favorable changes in contract estimates on operating results before income taxes compared with favorable changes of $37.2 million during 2017.\n** Primary reason for change. The increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase of $158.0 million in space programs primarily driven by the following (i) the RS-25 program development and integration effort in support of the SLS development program; (ii) increased development effort and volume on the Commercial Crew Development program; and (iii) increased deliveries on the Atlas V program. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $36.5 million in defense programs primarily driven by the timing of deliveries on the THAAD and Standard Missile programs partially offset by the net sales generated from the Coleman Aerospace acquisition. Further, as a result of the 2016 calendar, Aerojet Rocketdyne had 53 weeks of operations in 2016 compared with 52 weeks of operations in 2017. The additional week of operations, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 and accounted for $32.2 million in additional net sales, is included in the above discussion of program changes.\nSegment margin before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, net, and unusual items in 2017 compared with 2016 was up 30 basis points. Items that had a significant impact were favorable contract performance on numerous programs as a result of overhead cost reductions and reduced program risks, most notably on the THAAD program, partially offset by cost growth and manufacturing inefficiencies in 2017 on electric propulsion contracts.\nReal Estate Segment\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment performance\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2018, we recognized net sales of $1.4 million from a land sale of 57 acres of the Sacramento Land.

Total backlog includes both funded backlog (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated). Indefinite delivery and quantity contracts and unexercised options are not reported in total backlog. Backlog is subject to funding delays or program restructurings/cancellations which are beyond our control.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\nIn addition to segment performance (discussed above), we provide the Non-GAAP financial measures of our performance called Adjusted EBITDAP, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS. We use these metrics to measure our operating and total Company performance. We believe that for management and investors to effectively compare core performance from period to period, the metrics should exclude items that are not indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations such as retirement benefits (pension and postretirement benefits), significant non-cash expenses, the impacts of financing decisions on earnings, and items incurred outside the ordinary, on-going and customary course of our business. Accordingly, we define Adjusted EBITDAP as GAAP net income (loss) adjusted to exclude interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, retirement benefits net of amounts that are recoverable under our U.S. government contracts, and unusual items which we do not believe are reflective of such ordinary, on-going and customary activities. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS exclude retirement benefits net of amounts that are recoverable under our U.S. government contracts and unusual items which we do not believe are reflective of such ordinary, on-going and customary activities. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income (loss) or diluted EPS as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 73:

We devote a significant amount of resources and management attention to environmental matters and actively manage our ongoing processes to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We are involved in the remediation of environmental conditions that resulted from generally accepted manufacturing and disposal practices at certain plants in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, we have been designated a PRP with other companies at third party sites undergoing investigation and remediation.\nEstimating environmental remediation costs is difficult due to the significant uncertainties inherent in these activities, including the extent of remediation required, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, evolving technologies and the long period of time over which most remediation efforts take place. We:\n \u2022 accrue for costs associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and when our proportionate share of the costs can be reasonably estimated; and \n \u2022 record related estimated recoveries when such recoveries are deemed probable.  In addition to the costs associated with environmental remediation discussed above, we incur expenditures for recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances or pollutants in ongoing operations which were immaterial for 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nThe following table summarizes our recoverable amounts, environmental reserves, and range of liability, as of December 31, 2018: Table 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Recoverable\nAmount (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Reserve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Range\nof Liability\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerojet Rocketdyne - Sacramento\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>207.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$207.4 - $311.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerojet Rocketdyne - Baldwin Park Operable Unit (\"BPOU\")\n</td> <td>91.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.8 - 132.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Aerojet Rocketdyne sites\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4 - 22.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other sites\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3 - 5.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>285.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>327.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$327.9 - $472.1\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____\n (1) Excludes the receivable from Northrop of $58.5 million as of December 31, 2018, related to environmental costs already paid (and therefore not reserved) by us in prior years and reimbursable under our agreement with Northrop.  Environmental Reserves\nWe review on a quarterly basis estimated future remediation costs and have an established practice of estimating environmental remediation costs over a fifteen year period, except for those environmental remediation costs with a specific contractual term. Environmental liabilities at the BPOU site are currently estimated through the term of the new project agreement, which expires in May 2027. As the period for which estimated environmental remediation costs lengthens, the reliability of such estimates decreases. These estimates consider the investigative work and analysis of engineers, outside environmental consultants, and the advice of legal staff regarding the status and anticipated results of various administrative and legal proceedings. In most cases, only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated. In establishing our reserves, the most probable estimate is used when determinable; otherwise, the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Accordingly, such estimates can change as we periodically evaluate these estimates when new information becomes available. We cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will affect the estimated liability accrued. The timing of payment for estimated future environmental costs is influenced by a number of factors, such as the regulatory approval process and the time required designing, constructing, and implementing the remedy.\nThe following tables summarizes our environmental reserve activity:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>341.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>349.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>302.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenditures\n</td> <td>(36.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>327.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>341.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>349.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $23.3 million of environmental reserve additions in 2018 was primarily due to the following items: (i) $8.8 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $4.6 million of regulatory oversight costs and fees; (iii) $3.8 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (iv) $2.2 million of sampling analysis costs; and (v) $3.9 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nThe $31.3 million of environmental reserve additions in 2017 was primarily due to the following items: (i) $13.4 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $6.7 million of additional estimated costs related to the Camden, Arkansas site; (iii) $2.3 million associated with water replacement; and (iv) $8.9 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nThe $87.4 million of environmental reserve additions in 2016 was primarily due to the following items: (i) in 2016, we reached a decision with the U.S. government on the treatment of certain utility costs related to the Sacramento site resulting in a reserve increase of $59.4 million for the estimated impact over the current period and a fifteen year reserve period; (ii) $10.4 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (iii) $5.9 million of remediation related to inactive test sites and landfill clean-up; (iv) $2.7 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; and (v) $9.0 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nThe effect of the final resolution of environmental matters and our obligations for environmental remediation and compliance cannot be accurately predicted due to the uncertainty concerning both the amount and timing of future expenditures and due to regulatory or technological changes. We continue our efforts to mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of claims for recoveries from our insurance carriers and other PRPs and continued investigation of new and more cost effective remediation alternatives and associated technologies.\nEstimated Recoveries\nEnvironmental remediation costs are primarily incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these costs are recoverable from our contracts with the U.S. government. We currently estimate approximately 12% of our future Aerospace and Defense segment environmental remediation costs will not likely be reimbursable and are expensed.\nAllowable environmental remediation costs are charged to our contracts as the costs are incurred. Because these costs are recovered through forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet Rocketdyne to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on Aerojet Rocketdyne's sustained business volume from U.S. government contracts and programs.\nWhile we are currently seeking an arrangement with the U.S. government to recover environmental expenditures in excess of the reimbursement ceiling identified in the Global Settlement, there can be no assurances that such a recovery will be obtained, or if not obtained, that such unreimbursed environmental expenditures will not have a materially adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the current and non-current recoverable amounts from the U.S. government and Northrop: Table 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>321.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions\n</td> <td>18.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reimbursements\n</td> <td>(28.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments (1)\n</td> <td>32.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>344.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>321.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____\n(1) The adjustment in 2018 was primarily a result of reaching a determination with the U.S. government that certain environmental expenditures are reimbursable under the Global Settlement. See Note 8(d) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.\nThe activity for recoveries is commensurate with the activity associated with the environmental reserve activity.\nEnvironmental reserves and recoveries impact on the consolidated statements of operations\nThe expenses associated with adjustments to the environmental reserves are recorded as a component of other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

The increased cash usage from working capital was primarily due to (i) an increase of $47.3 million in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of cash receipts; (ii) an increase of $38.7 million in net income tax payments; and (iii) a decrease of $39.4 million in accounts payable due to vendor payment schedules. These factors were partially offset by improved cash flow from contracts of $39.7 million primarily due to the timing of contract performance payments.\nThe $54.1 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily driven by improved operating results and cash generation from working capital partially offset by $43.0 million of increased retirement benefit funding. The improved cash generation from working capital was primarily due to (i) a decrease in inventories on the Atlas V and PAC-3 contracts and (ii) an increase in customer advances partially offset by an increase in accounts receivables due to the timing of sales and milestone billings on a space program contract.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nDuring 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had capital expenditures of $43.2 million, $29.4 million, and $47.6 million. The higher capital expenditures in 2016 compared with 2018 and 2017 was primarily related to construction projects associated with supporting our CIP.\nDuring the 2018, we received insurance proceeds of $1.9 million and received net proceeds of $20.4 million in marketable securities.\nDuring 2017, we purchased Coleman Aerospace for $17.0 million and we made a net cash investment of $20.0 million in marketable securities.\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nDuring 2018, we had debt cash payments of $25.3 million. During 2017, we had debt cash payments of $20.0 million. During 2016, we had $700.6 million in debt cash payments and borrowings of $800.0 million.\nDebt Activity\nThe following table summarizes our debt principal activity: Table 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cash\nPayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-cash Activity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>370.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>345.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2 1/4% Notes\n</td> <td>300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Debt Activity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>670.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>672.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn September 20, 2018, we amended our Senior Credit Facility to a $1.0 billion commitment (see Note 6 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report).\nOutlook\nShort-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of recurring operating expenses, including but not limited to costs related to our capital and environmental expenditures, company-funded R&D expenditures, debt service requirements, and retirement benefit plans. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and availability under the Senior Credit Facility coupled with cash generated from our future operations will provide sufficient funds to meet our operating plan for the next twelve months. The operating plan for this period provides for full operation of our businesses, including interest and debt payments. As of December 31, 2018, we had $735.3 million of cash and cash equivalents as well as $620.6 million of available borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. Based on our existing debt agreements, we were in compliance with our financial and non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2018. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived by the lenders, could result in the acceleration of the Senior Credit Facility and 2\u00bc% Notes. In addition, our failure to pay principal and interest when due is a default under the Senior Credit Facility, and in certain cases, would cause a cross default on the 2\u00bc% Notes.\nWe are committed to a cash management strategy that maintains liquidity to adequately support the operation of the business, our growth strategy and to withstand unanticipated business volatility. Our cash management strategy includes maintaining the flexibility to pay down debt and/or repurchase shares depending on economic and other conditions. In connection with the implementation of our cash management strategy, our management may seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise if we believe that it is in our best interests. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nPotential future acquisitions depend, in part, on the availability of financial resources at an acceptable cost of capital. We expect to utilize cash on hand and cash generated by operations, as well as cash available under our Senior Credit Facility, which may involve renegotiation of credit limits to finance any future acquisitions. Other sources of capital could include the issuance of common and/or preferred stock, and the placement of debt. We periodically evaluate capital markets and may access such markets when circumstances appear favorable. We believe that sufficient capital resources will be available from one or several of these sources to finance any future acquisitions. However, no assurances can be made that acceptable financing will be available, or that acceptable acquisition candidates will be identified, or that any such acquisitions will be accretive to earnings.\nAs disclosed in Notes 8(b) and 8(c) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report, we have exposure for certain legal and environmental matters. We believe that it is currently not possible to estimate the impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of certain of these matters will have on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nMajor factors that could adversely impact our forecasted operating cash flows and our financial condition are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition, our liquidity and financial condition will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates on the portion of debt that bears interest at variable interest rates.\nContractual Obligations:\nWe have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of debt obligations, operating leases, certain other liabilities, and other commitments. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:  "}
