Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 of First Busey and subsidiaries. It should be read in conjunction with \u201cItem 1. Business,\u201d \u201cItem 6. Selected Financial Data,\u201d the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those that are critical to the portrayal and understanding of First Busey's financial condition and results of operations and require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex. These estimates involve judgments, estimates and uncertainties that are susceptible to change. In the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, and depending on the severity of such changes, the possibility of a materially different financial condition or materially different results of operations is a reasonable likelihood.\nFirst Busey's significant accounting policies are described in \u201cNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The majority of these accounting policies do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates or the variability of the estimates is not material. However, the following policies could be deemed critical:\nFair Value of Investment Securities. Securities are classified as held to maturity when First Busey has the ability and management has the positive intent to hold those securities to maturity. Accordingly, they are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. First Busey had $49.8 million of securities classified as held to maturity at December 31, 2015. First Busey had no securities classified as trading at December 31, 2015. Securities are classified as available for sale when First Busey may decide to sell those securities due to changes in market interest rates, liquidity needs, changes in yields on alternative investments, and for other reasons. They are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2015, First Busey had $834.8 million of securities classified as available for sale. For equity securities, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are utilized to determine fair value at the measurement date. For all other securities, we obtain fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the security's terms and conditions, among other things. Due to the limited nature of the market for certain securities, the fair value and potential sale proceeds could be materially different in the event of a sale.\nRealized securities gains or losses are reported in security gains (losses), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Declines in the fair value of securities below their amortized cost are evaluated to determine whether they are temporary or OTTI. If the Company (a) has the intent to sell a debt security or (b) will more likely than not be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery, then the Company recognizes the entire unrealized loss in earnings as an OTTI loss. If neither of these conditions are met, the Company evaluates whether a credit loss exists. The impairment is separated into the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss and the amount of total impairment related to all other factors. The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nThe Company also evaluates whether the decline in fair value of an equity security is temporary or OTTI. In determining whether an unrealized loss on an equity security is temporary or OTTI, management considers various factors including the magnitude and duration of the impairment, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to hold the equity security to forecasted recovery.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. First Busey has established an allowance for loan losses which represents its estimate of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements and reduces the total loans outstanding by an estimate of uncollectible loans. Loans deemed uncollectible are charged against and reduce the allowance. A provision for loan losses is charged to current expense. This provision acts to replenish the allowance for loan losses and to maintain the allowance at a level that management deems adequate.\nTo determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, a formal analysis is completed quarterly to assess the risk within the loan portfolio. This assessment is reviewed by senior management of Busey Bank and the Company. The analysis includes a review of historical performance, dollar amount and trends of past due loans, dollar amount and trends in non-performing loans, certain impaired loans, and loans identified as sensitive assets. Sensitive assets include non-accrual loans, past-due loans, loans on First Busey's watch loan reports and other loans identified as having probable potential for loss.\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component considers loans that are classified as impaired. For such loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying amount of that loan. The general component covers non-classified loans and classified loans not considered impaired, and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. Other adjustments may be made to the allowance for pools of loans after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss experience.\nA loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable First Busey will not be able to collect all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan becomes impaired, management generally calculates the impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. If the loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of the collateral is used to measure the amount of impairment. The amount of impairment and any subsequent changes are recorded through a charge to the provision for loan losses. For collateral dependent loans, First Busey has determined the required allowance on these loans based upon the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the applicable collateral. The required allowance or actual losses on these impaired loans could differ significantly if the ultimate fair value of the collateral is significantly different from the fair value estimates used by First Busey in estimating such potential losses.\nDeferred Taxes. We have maintained significant net deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences, the largest of which relates to the allowance for loan losses. For income tax return purposes, only actual charge-offs are deductible, not the provision for loan losses. Under generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, the forecasts of future income, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of the current and future economic and business conditions. We consider both positive and negative evidence regarding the ultimate recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Positive evidence includes available tax planning strategies and the probability that taxable income will continue to be generated in future periods, as it was in periods since March 31, 2010, while negative evidence includes a cumulative loss in 2009 and 2008 and certain business and economic trends. We evaluated the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and established a valuation allowance for certain state net operating loss and credit carryforwards that are not expected to be fully realized. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the other deferred tax assets included in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements will be fully realized. We determined that no valuation allowance was required for any other deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015, although there is no guarantee that those assets will be recognizable in future periods.\nWe assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is not more likely than not. In making this assessment, we must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income, and the possible application of future tax planning strategies.\nExecutive Summary\nOperating Results\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income by subsidiary:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Busey Bank\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FirsTech\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Busey Wealth Management\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated earnings per share, fully-diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Performance\nFirst Busey Corporation's net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $39.0 million and net income available to common stockholders was $38.3 million, or $1.32 per fully-diluted common share, compared to net income of $32.8 million and net income available to common stockholders of $32.0 million, or $1.10 per fully-diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2014. On January 8, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Herget Financial, which impacted year-to-date net income by $1.0 million in one-time expenses, occurring primarily in the first quarter of 2015. Further, the Company undertook initiatives to refine its branch network and restructure various internal teams during the first quarter of 2015, resulting in $0.7 million of fixed asset impairments and $0.3 million in other corporate restructuring costs.\nFollowing an extensive analysis of both customer needs and stockholder value, we consolidated three full service branches on July 30, 2015 and consolidated one additional branch on December 1, 2015. As we successfully service many emerging customer preferences through enhanced digital and telephone support, we have also modified hours where appropriate in our remaining thirty-five branch network to better match patterns of customer usage and added online scheduling capabilities. Our streamlined retail network will continue as a dynamic funding source with a relationship-driven focus to help our customers and communities flourish.\nOn December 3, 2015, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement with Pulaski, pursuant to which Pulaski will merge into First Busey, with First Busey as the surviving corporation. It is anticipated that Pulaski Bank, Pulaski's wholly-owned bank subsidiary, will be merged with and into Busey Bank, at a date following the completion of the holding company merger. At the time of the bank merger, Pulaski Bank's branches will become branches of Busey Bank. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago has approved the Merger and it is anticipated to be completed in the first half of 2016, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions in the Merger Agreement and the approval of the stockholders of both Pulaski and First Busey. The merger with Pulaski will allow the Company to significantly expand its geographic presence through a premier St. Louis banking franchise with an almost 100-year history and a strong regional mortgage presence. As of December 31, 2015, Pulaski had total consolidated assets of $1.65 billion, total loans of $1.41 billion and total deposits of $1.21 billion.\nSignificant operating performance items were:\n\u00b7 Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $111.8 million compared to $101.6 million for year ended December 31, 2014. 2015 net interest income included a net interest recovery on non-accrual loans of $0.9 million. The Federal Open Market Committee announced that effective December 17, 2015 the federal funds rate increased from 0.25% to 0.50%. The Company expects this increase in interest rates to be modestly favorable to net interest income in the next year.\n\u00b7 The net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased to 3.10% compared to 3.15% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\u00b7 The efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 improved to 62.84% from 65.11% for the same period of 2014. During 2015, various actions were undertaken to shape the future, trimming certain areas where sensible and adding in others with a continuing commitment to deliver optimal value to our stockholders. Following the anticipated Merger with Pulaski, one time charges relating to the integration of Pulaski may have a negative impact on the efficiency ratio in 2016.\n\u00b7 FirsTech's net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $1.7 million increased from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to growth in electronic processing revenues, including online and mobile services. FirsTech offers sophisticated payment processing capabilities and adds important diversity to our revenue stream while widening our array of service offerings to larger commercial clients.\n\u00b7 Busey Wealth Management's net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $4.6 million compared to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company believes the boutique services offered to ultra- high net worth clients by Trevett Capital Partners within its suite of wealth services broadens the Company's business base and enhances its ability to develop revenue sources in future years. In addition, our professional farm management and brokerage services are entrusted to care and maximize value for landowners of prime farmland in Illinois.\n\u00b7 Revenues from trust fees, commissions and brokers' fees, and remittance processing activities represented 53.4% of the Company's non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015, providing a balance to revenue from traditional banking activities. Trust fees and commission and brokers' fees increased to $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Remittance processing revenue increased to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $9.4 million, up 18.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAsset Quality\nWhile much internal focus has been directed toward growth, the Company's remains committed to credit quality. The December 31, 2015 asset metrics reflect the post combination results of acquiring Herget. As of December 31, 2015, the Company reported non-performing loans of $12.8 million compared to $9.0 million as of December 31, 2014. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans and non-performing assets continued to be low at 0.51% at December 31, 2015. With a continued commitment to the quality of assets and the strength of our balance sheet, near-term loan losses are expected to remain generally low. Asset quality metrics can be generally influenced by market-specific economic conditions beyond the control of the Company, and specific measures may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. The key metrics are as follows:\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of and for the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,637,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,415,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-performing loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-accrual loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans 90+ days past due\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-performing loans, segregated by geography\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Illinois/ Indiana\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Florida\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans 30-89 days past due\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-performing assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-performing assets to total loans and non-performing assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.51\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.38\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance as a percentage of non-performing loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 372.07\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 526.67\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses to loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.80\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 1.96\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operation - Three Years Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income and fees earned on earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate levels and volume fluctuations within earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income. Net interest margin is tax-equivalent net interest income as a percent of average earning assets.\nCertain assets with tax favorable treatment are evaluated on a tax-equivalent basis. Tax-equivalent basis assumes a federal income tax rate of 35%. Tax favorable assets generally have lower contractual pre-tax yields than fully taxable assets. A tax-equivalent analysis is performed by adding the tax savings to the earnings on tax favorable assets. After factoring in the tax favorable effects of these assets, the yields may be more appropriately evaluated against alternative earning assets. In addition to yield, various other risks are factored into the evaluation process.\nThe following tables show our consolidated average balance sheets, detailing the major categories of assets and liabilities, the interest income earned on interest-earning assets, the interest expense paid for the interest-bearing liabilities, and the related interest rates for the periods shown. The tables also show, for the periods indicated, a summary of the changes in interest earned and interest expense resulting from changes in volume and rates for the major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. All average information is provided on a daily average basis.\nAverage Balance Sheets and Interest Rates\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td>

income tax rate of 35%.\nEarning Assets, Sources of Funds, and Net Interest Margin\nTotal average interest-earning assets increased $386.1 million, or 11.7%, to $3.68 billion in 2015, as compared to $3.29 billion in 2014. Total average interest-earning assets increased $36.3 million, or 1.1%, to $3.29 billion in 2014, as compared to $3.25 billion in 2013. Average loans increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily due to our continued emphasis on organic commercial loan growth supplemented in 2015 by the Herget Financial acquisition; however, loans were added at lower yields than in 2013 due to the competitive lending environment. Loans generally have notably higher yields compared to interest-bearing bank deposits and investment securities. Our loan growth contributed to a positive effect on net interest margin which helped offset the downward pressure of a lower rate environment.\nTotal average interest-bearing liability balances increased $245.2 million, or 9.8%, to $2.74 billion in 2015, as compared to $2.49 billion in 2014. Total average interest-bearing liability balances decreased $66.7 million, or 2.6%, to $2.49 billion in 2014, as compared to $2.56 billion in 2013. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $121.8 million, or 20.4%, to $717.9 million in 2015, as compared to $596.1 million in 2014. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $64.4 million, or 12.1%, to $596.1 million in 2014, as compared to $531.7 million in 2013. Average non-interest bearing deposits represented 22.7% of total average deposits in 2015. The Company remains strongly core deposit funded with total average deposits in 2015 representing 91.0% of total average liabilities, with solid liquidity and significant market share in the communities we serve.\nInterest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $10.1 million, or 9.2%, to $120.2 million in 2015, from $110.1 million in 2014. The interest income increase related primarily to the increase in loan volumes, as discussed above. Interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased $1.0 million, or 0.9%, to $110.1 million in 2014, from $111.1 million in 2013. The interest income decline in 2014 related primarily to lower yields earned on assets in a low interest rate environment.\nInterest expense decreased during 2015 by $0.3 million, or 4.5%, to $6.2 million from $6.5 million in 2014. Interest expense decreased during 2014 by $2.1 million, or 24.7%, to $6.5 million from $8.6 million in 2013. The decreases in interest expense during the past two years were a result of favorable changes in funding mix and decreases in interest rates offered by the Company on certain deposit products as the interest rate environment remained low.\nNet interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $10.4 million, or 10.0%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. Net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $1.2 million, or 1.14%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. The Federal Open Market Committee announced that effective December 17, 2015, the federal funds rate increased from 0.25% to 0.50%. The Company expects this increase in interest rates to be modestly favorable to net interest income in the next year.\nNet interest margin, our net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets stated on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 3.10% in 2015 compared to 3.15% in 2014 and 2013. The net interest spread, which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, also on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.04% in 2015 compared to 3.09% in 2014 and 3.07% in 2013.\nThe net interest margin discussion above is based upon annual results and average balances, which do not fully explain the trends of the net interest margin during the year.

The development of a stronger asset mix from increased loan balances, while actively bringing down interest expense and optimizing funding costs, remains a focus. We believe improvements in margin will be achieved through continued deployment of our liquid funds at higher yields as we redeploy cash into investment securities and loans.\nManagement attempts to mitigate the effects of an unpredictable interest-rate environment through effective portfolio management, prudent loan underwriting and operational efficiencies.\nOther Income\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trust fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commissions and brokers' fees, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 2,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remittance processing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 9,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 12,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other service charges and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 6,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sales of loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 4,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,504\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (53.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Security gains, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (396\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (51.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 3,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,134\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (24.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 62,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,642\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (5.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal other income of $64.8 million increased $5.9 million from $58.9 million in 2014. Total other income of $58.9 million in 2014 decreased $3.7 million from $62.6 million in 2013.\nCombined wealth management revenue, consisting of trust fees and commissions and broker's fees, net, of $23.5 million in 2015 rose $1.2 million from $22.3 million in 2014 and 2014 income rose $1.4 million from $20.9 million in 2013. Growth in new assets under care (\u201cAUC\u201d), driven by our wealth management teams in 2015 and 2014, impacts fee income as wealth management revenues are typically correlated to levels of AUC. Furthermore, the Company believes the boutique services offered by Trevett Capital Partners within its suite of wealth services broadens its business base and enhances its ability to further develop revenue sources. In addition, our professional farm management and brokerage services are entrusted to care and maximize value for landowners of prime farmland in Illinois.\nRemittance processing revenue relates to our payment processing company, FirsTech. FirsTech's revenue of $11.1 million in 2015 increased 18.0% compared to $9.4 million in 2014 and revenue of $9.4 million in 2014 increased 12.8% compared to $8.4 million in 2013. The increases were primarily due to growth in electronic processing revenues, including online and mobile services. FirsTech adds important diversity to our revenue stream while widening our array of service offerings to larger commercial clients within our footprint and nationally.\nOverall, service charges on deposit accounts combined with other service charges and fees increased to $19.1 million in 2015 as compared to $18.3 million in 2014 and increased in 2014 as compared to $17.9 million in 2013. Evolving regulation, product changes and changing behaviors by our client base may impact the revenue derived from charges on deposit accounts.\nGain on sales of loans of $5.8 million in 2015 increased $1.1 million compared to $4.7 million in 2014. Gain on sales of loans of $4.7 million in 2014 decreased $5.5 million compared to $10.2 million in 2013. Fluctuations in gain on sales of loans is predominantly based on residential mortgage activity.\nSecurity gains, net, of $0.4 million in 2015 decreased compared to $0.8 million in 2014 but increased in 2014 compared to $0.6 million in 2013. Security gains, net, vary based on the Company's decisions around selling securities.\nOther income of $4.9 million in 2015 increased as compared to $3.5 million in 2014 and decreased in 2014 as compared to $4.6 million in 2013. The decrease in 2014 related to private equity investment losses and fluctuations across multiple revenue sources.\nOther Expense\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December

compared to $108.2 million in 2014 but decreased by $4.1 million in 2014 as compared to $112.3 million in 2013. In 2015, total other expense was influenced by the Herget Financial acquisition and other non-recurring expenses during the first quarter of 2015. In 2014, the Company focused on cost control initiatives, which broadly reduced operating expenses. We continue to examine all areas of the Company, seeking sensible opportunities to reduce cost and enhance efficiency. Following the anticipated Merger with Pulaski, one time charges relating to the integration of Pulaski may have a negative impact on expenses in 2016.\nTotal compensation expense increased to $63.5 million in 2015 as compared to $61.3 million in 2014 but decreased in 2014 as compared to $63.8 million in 2013. The 2015 increase over 2014 was due to higher commissions related to mortgage production, first quarter restructuring expenses, and an initial increase in the number of employees in connection with the Herget Financial acquisition. Cost containment efforts and personnel reductions starting in 2013 contributed to positive expense trends from 2013 to 2014.\nCombined net occupancy expense of premises and furniture and equipment expenses of $13.7 million in 2015 increased as compared to $13.2 million in 2014 but decreased in 2014 as compared to $13.3 million in 2013. We continue to evaluate our operations for appropriate cost control measures while seeking improvements in service delivery to our customers.\nData processing expense increased 18.9% in 2015 to $12.9 million as compared to $10.9 million in 2014 and increased 4.0% in 2014 as compared to $10.5 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to non-recurring software conversion expenses related to the acquisition of Herget Financial. A portion of the increase was also related to supporting new sources of revenue growth at FirsTech. As the Company manages data processing expense, it continues to enhance its mobile and internet banking services and prioritize strategies to mitigate the risk from cybercriminals through the use of new technology, industry best practices and customer education.\nAmortization of intangible assets increased in 2015 to $3.2 million as compared to $2.9 million in 2014 as a result of the January 8, 2015 Herget Financial acquisition. Amortization of intangible assets decreased in 2014 as compared to $3.1 million in 2013.\nRegulatory expense increased 13.4% in 2015 to $2.4 million as compared to $2.1 million in 2014. Regulatory expense decreased 9.2% in 2014 as compared to $2.3 million in 2013. On January 21, 2016, the FDIC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\u201cNPR\u201d) on proposed refinements to the deposit insurance assessment system for small insured depository institutions (generally, those institutions with less than $10 billion in total assets). The NPR revised an NPR adopted by the board on June 16, 2015 in response to comments received. The refinements would become operative the quarter after the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund reaches 1.15%. The Company projects that the proposal would be favorable to our annual cost of FDIC insurance.\nOther expense of $19.6 million in 2015 increased $1.8 million as compared to $17.8 million in 2014 and decreased $1.5 million in 2014 as compared to $19.3 million in 2013. The 2015 increase was the result of restructuring initiatives, which included $0.7 million in fixed asset impairments, $0.6 million of acquisition related expenses and $0.2 million in costs exploring other strategic growth opportunities. The 2014 decrease was the result of actions taken starting in early 2013 for widespread reductions in expenses due to an enhanced emphasis on cost control.\nThe effective rate on income taxes, or income taxes divided by income before taxes, of 34.7%, 34.9% and 32.9% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, was lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately 40% due to fairly stable amounts of tax preferred interest income, such as municipal bond interest and bank owned life insurance income, accounting for a portion of our taxable income. As taxable income increases, we expect our effective tax rate to increase. Under current law, Illinois net operating loss carryover limitations expired in 2014 and the corporate income tax rate decreased as of January 1, 2015. The Company continues to monitor evolving state tax legislation and its potential impact on operations on an ongoing basis.\nThe efficiency ratio represents total other expense, less amortization charges, as a percentage of tax-equivalent net interest income plus other income, less security gains and losses. The efficiency ratio, which is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used by management and the investment community in the banking industry, measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. The efficiency ratio improved in 2015 to 62.8% as compared to 65.1% in 2014 and 66.4% in 2013. We will continue to examine appropriate avenues to improve efficiency, as a focus in future periods, with an emphasis on revenue growth.\nBalance Sheet\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> Significant Balance Sheet Items\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities, including available for sale and held to maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 884,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 761,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 123,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans, net, including loans held for sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,589,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,368,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 221,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,998,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,665,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 333,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposits:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest-bearing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 881,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 666,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 215,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest-bearing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,407,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,234,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 173,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,289,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,900,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 388,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities sold under agreements to repurchase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 172,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 198,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25,921\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (13.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,625,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,231,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 393,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stockholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 373,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 433,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (60,453\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (13.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal assets increased by $333.4 million, or 9.1%, to $4.00 billion at December 31, 2015, as compared to $3.67 billion at December 31, 2014.

The shares were redeemed at their liquidation value of $1,000 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends to, but excluding December 18, 2015. 2015 earnings, partially offset by dividends paid on preferred and common stock also impacted stockholders' equity.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company has classified the majority of its investment securities as available for sale. Securities available for sale are carried at fair value. Securities held to maturity are carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of securities available for sale was $834.8 million and the amortized cost was $830.9 million. There were $6.2 million of gross unrealized gains and $2.3 million of gross unrealized losses for a net unrealized gain of $3.9 million. The unrealized gain, net of tax, of $2.3 million has been included in stockholders' equity.

As a portion of our allowance is based upon weighted historical charge-offs, the lesser amount of charge-offs in recent years are replacing years with significantly higher charge-offs in the historical data, causing the weighted historical average charge-off rate to decline. Adjustments to increase qualitative factors were made during 2015 and 2014 to recognize perceived changing degrees of risk, offset decreasing quantitative factors and reflect management's evaluation of risk.\nTypically, when we move loans into non-accrual status, the loans are collateral dependent and charged down through the allowance for loan losses to the fair value of our interest in the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell. Our loan portfolio is collateralized primarily by real estate.\nWe continue to attempt to identify problem loan situations on a proactive basis. Once problem loans are identified, adjustments to the provision for loan losses are made based upon all information available at that time. The provision reflects management's analysis of additional allowance for loan losses necessary to cover probable losses in our loan portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2015, management believed the level of the allowance and coverage of non-performing loans to be appropriate based upon the information available. However, additional losses may be identified in our loan portfolio as new information is obtained. We may need to provide for additional loan losses in the future as management continues to identify potential problem loans and gains further information concerning existing problem loans.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses is a current charge against income and represents an amount which management believes is sufficient to maintain an appropriate allowance for known and probable losses in the loan portfolio. In assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses, management considers the size and quality of the loan portfolio measured against prevailing economic conditions, regulatory guidelines, historical loan loss experience and credit quality of the portfolio. When a determination is made by management to charge-off a loan balance, such write-off is charged against the allowance for loan losses.\nAs net charge-offs and non-performing loans trended lower, the provision for loan losses decreased to $1.6 million in 2015 compared to $2.0 million in 2014 and $7.5 million in 2013.\nSensitive assets include non-accrual loans, loans on our classified loan reports and other loans identified as having more than reasonable potential for loss. Management reviews sensitive assets on at least a quarterly basis for changes in each applicable customer's ability to pay and changes in valuation of underlying collateral in order to estimate probable losses. The majority of these loans are being repaid in conformance with their contracts.\nNon-performing Loans\nLoans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when, in management's opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. Loans may be placed on non-accrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nThe following table sets forth information concerning non-performing loans and performing restructured loans at December 31 for each year indicated:\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-accrual loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans 90+ days past due and still accruing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repossessed assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other assets acquired in satisfaction of debts previously contracted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing loans and OREO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-performing loans to loans, before allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.48\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.76\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 1.22\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 1.88\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-performing loans and OREO to loans, before allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.51\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.38\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.85\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 1.39\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 2.28\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performing restructured loans not included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal non-performing loans and OREO were $13.5 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $9.2 million at December 31, 2014. Asset quality metrics remain dependent upon market-specific economic conditions, and specific measures may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. The 2015 totals reflect the post-combination results of acquiring Herget Financial.\nPotential Problem Loans\nPotential problem loans are those loans which are not categorized as impaired, restructured, non-accrual or 90+ days past due, but where current information indicates that the borrower may not be able to comply with present loan repayment terms. Management assesses the potential for loss on such loans as it would with other problem loans and has considered the effect of any potential loss in determining its provision for probable loan losses. Potential problem loans totaled $29.2 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $30.9 million at December 31, 2014. We do not believe the potential losses associated with these potential problem loans will be as great as seen in the past. Management continues to monitor these credits and anticipates that restructurings, guarantees, additional collateral or other planned actions will result in full repayment of the debts. As of December 31, 2015, management identified no other loans that represent or result from trends or uncertainties which management reasonably expected to materially impact future operating results, liquidity or capital resources. As of December 31, 2015, management was not aware of any information about any other credits which caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower(s) to comply with the loan repayment terms.\nDeposits\nAs indicated in the following table, average noninterest-bearing deposits as a percentage of average total deposits increased to 22.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 20.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014, and 18.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013. We continue to focus on deepening our relationship value with customers, which, in turn, fosters deposit growth. In addition, deposit growth was impacted in 2015 by the Herget Financial acquisition.\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest-bearing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> demand deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 717,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 596,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 531,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest-bearing demand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 48,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.06\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 49,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.06\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Savings/Money Market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,866,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 1,693,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 1,681,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 500,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.52\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 537,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 633,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.83\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,168,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,875,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,895,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2015, the ending balance of time deposits with a minimum denomination of $100,000 was approximately $128.1 million with the following maturities (dollars in thousands):\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> Under 3 months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3 to 6 months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6 to 12 months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over 12 months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 128,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company had reciprocal brokered time deposits of $0.4 million at December 31, 2015 included in the balance of time deposits with maturities in excess of 12 months. The Company also had national certificates of deposit of $0.4 million at December 31, 2015 included in the balance of time deposits, with maturities of $0.3 million in 6 to 12 months and $0.1 million in excess of 12 months.\nFederal Funds Purchased, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase and Other Short-term Borrowings\nThe following table sets forth the distribution of short-term borrowings and weighted average interest rates thereon as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally represent overnight borrowing transactions. First Busey had no other categories of short-term borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013; however, during 2014 the Company purchased federal funds and FHLB advances to test operational availability to access funds if needed.\nFurther, on November 20, 2015, the Company entered into a credit agreement to make available a revolving loan facility to the Company in the maximum principal amount of $20.0 million. The loan has an annual interest rate of 2.50% plus the one-month LIBOR rate and has a maturity date of November 19, 2016. The loan also bears a non-usage fee calculated based on the average daily principal balance of the loan outstanding during the prior fiscal quarter. The Company had no outstanding amounts on its loan at December 31, 2015; however, during the fourth quarter of 2015 the Company tested operational availability to access funds if needed.\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td> Securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 172,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 198,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 172,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum outstanding at any month end\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 202,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 198,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 172,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average daily balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 179,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 148,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 137,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate during period(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.12\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The weighted average interest rate is computed by dividing total interest for the period by the average daily balance outstanding.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity management is the process by which we ensure that adequate liquid funds are available to meet the present and future cash flow obligations arising in the daily operations of our business. These financial obligations consist of needs for funds to meet commitments to borrowers for extensions of credit, fund capital expenditures, honor withdrawals by customers, pay dividends to stockholders and pay operating expenses. Our most liquid assets are cash and due from banks, interest-bearing bank deposits, and, if needed, federal funds sold. The balances of these assets are dependent on the Company's operating, investing, lending, and financing activities during any given period. Average liquid assets are summarized in the table below:\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and due from banks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 92,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest-bearing bank deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 237,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 160,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 194,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 324,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 248,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 286,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percent of average total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 8.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFirst Busey's primary sources of funds consist of deposits, investment maturities and sales, loan principal repayments, and capital funds. Additional liquidity is provided by repurchase agreements, the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve and the FHLB, and brokered deposits. Management intends to satisfy long-term liquidity needs primarily through retention of capital funds.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, as part of our ongoing balance sheet strategy, the Company took on a modest level of long-term debt taking advantage of low interest rates and attractive funding options by executing $30.0 million and $50.0 million in FHLB discount note indexed advances, respectively. The variable rate notes range in maturity from nineteen months to ten years with options to prepay at par prior to maturity.\nAs of December 31, 2015, management believed that adequate liquidity existed to meet all projected cash flow obligations. We seek to achieve a satisfactory degree of liquidity by actively managing both assets and liabilities. Asset management guides the proportion of liquid assets to total assets, while liability management monitors future funding requirements and prices liabilities accordingly.\nThe ability of the Company to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and to service its debt historically was dependent on the receipt of cash dividends from its subsidiaries. Under applicable regulatory requirements, an Illinois state-chartered bank such as Busey Bank may not pay dividends in excess of its net profits. Because Busey Bank has been in a retained earnings deficit position since 2009, it has not been able to pay dividends since that time.\nWith prior approval from its regulators, however, an Illinois state-chartered bank in this situation may be able to reduce its capital stock, by amending its charter to decrease the authorized number of shares, and then make a subsequent distribution to its holding company. Using this approach, and with the approval of its regulators, Busey Bank distributed $50.0 million to the Company on January 22, 2013, distributed $60.0 million to the Company on October 22, 2014 and distributed $60.0 million to the Company on December 8, 2015. The Company will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of future capital distributions.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nThe Bank routinely enters into commitments to extend credit in the normal course of its business. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had outstanding loan commitments including lines of credit of $618.6 million and $561.4 million, respectively. The balance of commitments to extend credit represents future cash requirements and some of these commitments may expire without being drawn upon. We anticipate we will have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments, including loan applications received and in process prior to the issuance of firm commitments.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments. Such obligations generally relate to funding of operations through deposits, debt issuance, and property and equipment leases. The following table summarizes significant contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Junior\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Subordinated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Debt Owed to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Certificates of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Unconsolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Long-term\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Deposit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Trusts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 285,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 286,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 458,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 595,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 633,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $61.5 million, $68.1 million and $98.2 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Significant items affecting the cash flows provided by operating activities include net income, depreciation and amortization expense, the provision for loan losses, deferred income taxes, gain on sales of loans, and activities related to the origination and sale of mortgage loans held for sale. Net cash provided by mortgage loan originations was $8.6 million in 2015, $8.2 million in 2014 and $36.4 million in 2013. Fluctuations in sales are primarily a function of changes in market rates for mortgage loans, which influence refinance activity.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $134.2 million in 2015, $51.3 million in 2014, and $118.7 million in 2013. Significant activities affecting cash flows from investing activities are those activities associated with managing the Company's investment and loan portfolios and cash received in acquisitions. Due to the continued emphasis on growth, the Company experienced a net increase in loans of $118.4 million in 2015, $126.6 million in 2014 and $258.4 million in 2013.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $52.6 million in 2015 and $91.0 million in 2014 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $99.1 million in 2013. Significant items affecting cash flows from financing activities are deposits, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, payment of dividends and proceeds and redemption from stock issuances. Deposits, which represent the Company's primary funding source, increased by $146.4 million in 2015 and $31.7 million in 2014, and as such, drove the positive cash inflow from financing activities. In comparison, deposits shrank $111.2 million in 2013. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $25.9 million in 2015, but increased $26.5 million in 2014 and $33.3 million in 2013. In 2015 and 2014, the Company took on a modest level of long-term debt taking advantage of low interest rates and attractive funding options. In 2015, the Company redeemed all of the 72,664 shares of its Series C Preferred Stock that had been issued to the Treasury pursuant to the SBLF program.\nCapital Resources\nOur capital ratios are in excess of those required to be considered \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d pursuant to applicable regulatory guidelines at both the consolidated level and at the Bank. The Federal Reserve Board uses capital adequacy guidelines in its examination and regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks. Risk-based capital ratios are established by allocating assets and certain off-balance-sheet commitments into risk-weighted categories. These balances are then multiplied by the factor appropriate for that risk-weighted category. The guidelines require bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks to maintain a total capital to total risk-weighted asset ratio of not less than 8.00%, Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted asset ratio of not less than 6.00%, Common Equity Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted asset ratio of not less than 4.50% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of not less than 4.00%. As of December 31, 2015, we had a total capital to total risk-weighted asset ratio of 14.55%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of 13.29%, Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of 11.52% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.13%; the Bank had ratios of 13.45%, 12.19%, 12.19% and 9.32%, respectively.\nRedemption of Preferred Stock Under the Small Business Lending Fund\nOn August 25, 2011, the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement with the Treasury, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to the Treasury 72,664 shares of its Series C Preferred Stock, having a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $72,664,000. On December 18, 2015, the Company redeemed all of the 72,664 shares of its Series C Preferred Stock that had been issued to the Treasury pursuant to the SBLF program. The shares were redeemed at their liquidation value of $1,000 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends to, but excluding December 18, 2015. The redemption was approved by the Company's primary federal regulator and terminates the Company's participation in the SBLF program. Before redemption, the Series C Preferred Stock qualified as Tier 1 capital for the Company. Non-cumulative dividends were payable quarterly on the Series C Preferred Stock, which began October 1, 2011.\nCPP Warrant\nIn connection with the Company's participation in the Capital Purchase Program (\u201cCPP\u201d), the Company issued to Treasury a warrant to purchase 382,555 shares of the Company's common stock. Subsequent to the date of the Company's participation in the CPP, it raised additional capital through a public offering of common stock and, as a result of that offering, the number of shares of common stock subject to the warrant were reduced by 50% to 191,278. On November 23, 2011 the Treasury completed an auction to sell its warrant in a private transaction. At December 31, 2015, this warrant to purchase 191,278 shares of the Company's common stock, at an exercise price of $39.21, remained outstanding.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. Information relating to accounting pronouncements issued and applicable to the Company in 2015 appears in \u201cNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has not identified any other standards that it believes merit further discussion.\nEffects of Inflation\nThe effect of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from the effect on an industrial company. While a financial institution's operating expenses, particularly salary and employee benefits, are affected by general inflation, the asset and liability structure of a financial institution consists largely of monetary items. Monetary items, such as cash, loans and deposits, are those assets and liabilities which are or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in prices. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than does general inflation.

7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 of First Busey and subsidiaries. It should be read in conjunction with \u201cItem 1. Business,\u201d \u201cItem 6. Selected Financial Data,\u201d the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those that are critical to the portrayal and understanding of First Busey's financial condition and results of operations and require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex. These estimates involve judgments, estimates and uncertainties that are susceptible to change. In the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, and depending on the severity of such changes, the possibility of a materially different financial condition or materially different results of operations is a reasonable likelihood.\nFirst Busey's significant accounting policies are described in \u201cNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The majority of these accounting policies do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates or the variability of the estimates is not material. However, the following policies could be deemed critical:\nFair Value of Investment Securities. Securities are classified as held to maturity when First Busey has the ability and management has the positive intent to hold those securities to maturity. Accordingly, they are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. First Busey had $49.8 million of securities classified as held to maturity at December 31, 2015. First Busey had no securities classified as trading at December 31, 2015. Securities are classified as available for sale when First Busey may decide to sell those securities due to changes in market interest rates, liquidity needs, changes in yields on alternative investments, and for other reasons. They are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2015, First Busey had $834.8 million of securities classified as available for sale. For equity securities, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are utilized to determine fair value at the measurement date. For all other securities, we obtain fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the security's terms and conditions, among other things. Due to the limited nature of the market for certain securities, the fair value and potential sale proceeds could be materially different in the event of a sale.\nRealized securities gains or losses are reported in security gains (losses), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Declines in the fair value of securities below their amortized cost are evaluated to determine whether they are temporary or OTTI. If the Company (a) has the intent to sell a debt security or (b) will more likely than not be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery, then the Company recognizes the entire unrealized loss in earnings as an OTTI loss. If neither of these conditions are met, the Company evaluates whether a credit loss exists. The impairment is separated into the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss and the amount of total impairment related to all other factors. The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nThe Company also evaluates whether the decline in fair value of an equity security is temporary or OTTI. In determining whether an unrealized loss on an equity security is temporary or OTTI, management considers various factors including the magnitude and duration of the impairment, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to hold the equity security to forecasted recovery.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. First Busey has established an allowance for loan losses which represents its estimate of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements and reduces the total loans outstanding by an estimate of uncollectible loans. Loans deemed uncollectible are charged against and reduce the allowance. A provision for loan losses is charged to current expense. This provision acts to replenish the allowance for loan losses and to maintain the allowance at a level that management deems adequate.\nTo determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, a formal analysis is completed quarterly to assess the risk within the loan portfolio. This assessment is reviewed by senior management of Busey Bank and the Company. The analysis includes a review of historical performance, dollar amount and trends of past due loans, dollar amount and trends in non-performing loans, certain impaired loans, and loans identified as sensitive assets. Sensitive assets include non-accrual loans, past-due loans, loans on First Busey's watch loan reports and other loans identified as having probable potential for loss.\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component considers loans that are classified as impaired. For such loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying amount of that loan. The general component covers non-classified loans and classified loans not considered impaired, and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. Other adjustments may be made to the allowance for pools of loans after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss experience.\nA loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable First Busey will not be able to collect all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan becomes impaired, management generally calculates the impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. If the loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of the collateral is used to measure the amount of impairment. The amount of impairment and any subsequent changes are recorded through a charge to the provision for loan losses. For collateral dependent loans, First Busey has determined the required allowance on these loans based upon the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the applicable collateral. The required allowance or actual losses on these impaired loans could differ significantly if the ultimate fair value of the collateral is significantly different from the fair value estimates used by First Busey in estimating such potential losses.\nDeferred Taxes. We have maintained significant net deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences, the largest of which relates to the allowance for loan losses. For income tax return purposes, only actual charge-offs are deductible, not the provision for loan losses. Under generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, the forecasts of future income, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of the current and future economic and business conditions. We consider both positive and negative evidence regarding the ultimate recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Positive evidence includes available tax planning strategies and the probability that taxable income will continue to be generated in future periods, as it was in periods since March 31, 2010, while negative evidence includes a cumulative loss in 2009 and 2008 and certain business and economic trends. We evaluated the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and established a valuation allowance for certain state net operating loss and credit carryforwards that are not expected to be fully realized. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the other deferred tax assets included in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements will be fully realized. We determined that no valuation allowance was required for any other deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015, although there is no guarantee that those assets will be recognizable in future periods.\nWe assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is not more likely than not. In making this assessment, we must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income, and the possible application of future tax planning strategies.\nExecutive Summary\nOperating Results\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n\nOperating Performance\nFirst Busey Corporation's net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $39.0 million and net income available to common stockholders was $38.3 million, or $1.32 per fully-diluted common share, compared to net income of $32.8 million and net income available to common stockholders of $32.0 million, or $1.10 per fully-diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2014. On January 8, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Herget Financial, which impacted year-to-date net income by $1.0 million in one-time expenses, occurring primarily in the first quarter of 2015. Further, the Company undertook initiatives to refine its branch network and restructure various internal teams during the first quarter of 2015, resulting in $0.7 million of fixed asset impairments and $0.3 million in other corporate restructuring costs.\nFollowing an extensive analysis of both customer needs and stockholder value, we consolidated three full service branches on July 30, 2015 and consolidated one additional branch on December 1, 2015. As we successfully service many emerging customer preferences through enhanced digital and telephone support, we have also modified hours where appropriate in our remaining thirty-five branch network to better match patterns of customer usage and added online scheduling capabilities. Our streamlined retail network will continue as a dynamic funding source with a relationship-driven focus to help our customers and communities flourish.\nOn December 3, 2015, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement with Pulaski, pursuant to which Pulaski will merge into First Busey, with First Busey as the surviving corporation. It is anticipated that Pulaski Bank, Pulaski's wholly-owned bank subsidiary, will be merged with and into Busey Bank, at a date following the completion of the holding company merger. At the time of the bank merger, Pulaski Bank's branches will become branches of Busey Bank. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago has approved the Merger and it is anticipated to be completed in the first half of 2016, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions in the Merger Agreement and the approval of the stockholders of both Pulaski and First Busey. The merger with Pulaski will allow the Company to significantly expand its geographic presence through a premier St. Louis banking franchise with an almost 100-year history and a strong regional mortgage presence. As of December 31, 2015, Pulaski had total consolidated assets of $1.65 billion, total loans of $1.41 billion and total deposits of $1.21 billion.\nSignificant operating performance items were:\n\u00b7 Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $111.8 million compared to $101.6 million for year ended December 31, 2014. 2015 net interest income included a net interest recovery on non-accrual loans of $0.9 million. The Federal Open Market Committee announced that effective December 17, 2015 the federal funds rate increased from 0.25% to 0.50%. The Company expects this increase in interest rates to be modestly favorable to net interest income in the next year.\n\u00b7 The net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased to 3.10% compared to 3.15% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\u00b7 The efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 improved to 62.84% from 65.11% for the same period of 2014. During 2015, various actions were undertaken to shape the future, trimming certain areas where sensible and adding in others with a continuing commitment to deliver optimal value to our stockholders. Following the anticipated Merger with Pulaski, one time charges relating to the integration of Pulaski may have a negative impact on the efficiency ratio in 2016.\n\u00b7 FirsTech's net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $1.7 million increased from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to growth in electronic processing revenues, including online and mobile services. FirsTech offers sophisticated payment processing capabilities and adds important diversity to our revenue stream while widening our array of service offerings to larger commercial clients.\n\u00b7 Busey Wealth Management's net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $4.6 million compared to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company believes the boutique services offered to ultra- high net worth clients by Trevett Capital Partners within its suite of wealth services broadens the Company's business base and enhances its ability to develop revenue sources in future years. In addition, our professional farm management and brokerage services are entrusted to care and maximize value for landowners of prime farmland in Illinois.\n\u00b7 Revenues from trust fees, commissions and brokers' fees, and remittance processing activities represented 53.4% of the Company's non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015, providing a balance to revenue from traditional banking activities. Trust fees and commission and brokers' fees increased to $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Remittance processing revenue increased to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $9.4 million, up 18.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAsset Quality\nWhile much internal focus has been directed toward growth, the Company's remains committed to credit quality. The December 31, 2015 asset metrics reflect the post combination results of acquiring Herget. As of December 31, 2015, the Company reported non-performing loans of $12.8 million compared to $9.0 million as of December 31, 2014. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans and non-performing assets continued to be low at 0.51% at December 31, 2015. With a continued commitment to the quality of assets and the strength of our balance sheet, near-term loan losses are expected to remain generally low. Asset quality metrics can be generally influenced by market-specific economic conditions beyond the control of the Company, and specific measures may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. The key metrics are as follows:\n\nResults of Operation - Three Years Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income and fees earned on earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate levels and volume fluctuations within earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income. Net interest margin is tax-equivalent net interest income as a percent of average earning assets.\nCertain assets with tax favorable treatment are evaluated on a tax-equivalent basis. Tax-equivalent basis assumes a federal income tax rate of 35%. Tax favorable assets generally have lower contractual pre-tax yields than fully taxable assets. A tax-equivalent analysis is performed by adding the tax savings to the earnings on tax favorable assets. After factoring in the tax favorable effects of these assets, the yields may be more appropriately evaluated against alternative earning assets. In addition to yield, various other risks are factored into the evaluation process.\nThe following tables show our consolidated average balance sheets, detailing the major categories of assets and liabilities, the interest income earned on interest-earning assets, the interest expense paid for the interest-bearing liabilities, and the related interest rates for the periods shown. The tables also show, for the periods indicated, a summary of the changes in interest earned and interest expense resulting from changes in volume and rates for the major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. All average information is provided on a daily average basis.\nAverage Balance Sheets and Interest Rates\n\n(1)On a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%.\n(2)Non-accrual loans have been included in average loans.\n(3)Includes loan fee income of $2.2 million, $3.0 million and $2.8 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nAverage Balance Sheets and Interest Rates (continued)\nChanges in Net Interest Income:\n\n(1)Changes due to both rate and volume have been allocated proportionally.\n(2)On a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%.\nEarning Assets, Sources of Funds, and Net Interest Margin\nTotal average interest-earning assets increased $386.1 million, or 11.7%, to $3.68 billion in 2015, as compared to $3.29 billion in 2014. Total average interest-earning assets increased $36.3 million, or 1.1%, to $3.29 billion in 2014, as compared to $3.25 billion in 2013. Average loans increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily due to our continued emphasis on organic commercial loan growth supplemented in 2015 by the Herget Financial acquisition; however, loans were added at lower yields than in 2013 due to the competitive lending environment. Loans generally have notably higher yields compared to interest-bearing bank deposits and investment securities. Our loan growth contributed to a positive effect on net interest margin which helped offset the downward pressure of a lower rate environment.\nTotal average interest-bearing liability balances increased $245.2 million, or 9.8%, to $2.74 billion in 2015, as compared to $2.49 billion in 2014. Total average interest-bearing liability balances decreased $66.7 million, or 2.6%, to $2.49 billion in 2014, as compared to $2.56 billion in 2013. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $121.8 million, or 20.4%, to $717.9 million in 2015, as compared to $596.1 million in 2014. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $64.4 million, or 12.1%, to $596.1 million in 2014, as compared to $531.7 million in 2013. Average non-interest bearing deposits represented 22.7% of total average deposits in 2015. The Company remains strongly core deposit funded with total average deposits in 2015 representing 91.0% of total average liabilities, with solid liquidity and significant market share in the communities we serve.\nInterest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $10.1 million, or 9.2%, to $120.2 million in 2015, from $110.1 million in 2014. The interest income increase related primarily to the increase in loan volumes, as discussed above. Interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased $1.0 million, or 0.9%, to $110.1 million in 2014, from $111.1 million in 2013. The interest income decline in 2014 related primarily to lower yields earned on assets in a low interest rate environment.\nInterest expense decreased during 2015 by $0.3 million, or 4.5%, to $6.2 million from $6.5 million in 2014. Interest expense decreased during 2014 by $2.1 million, or 24.7%, to $6.5 million from $8.6 million in 2013. The decreases in interest expense during the past two years were a result of favorable changes in funding mix and decreases in interest rates offered by the Company on certain deposit products as the interest rate environment remained low.\nNet interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $10.4 million, or 10.0%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. Net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $1.2 million, or 1.14%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. The Federal Open Market Committee announced that effective December 17, 2015, the federal funds rate increased from 0.25% to 0.50%. The Company expects this increase in interest rates to be modestly favorable to net interest income in the next year.\nNet interest margin, our net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets stated on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 3.10% in 2015 compared to 3.15% in 2014 and 2013. The net interest spread, which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, also on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.04% in 2015 compared to 3.09% in 2014 and 3.07% in 2013.\nThe net interest margin discussion above is based upon annual results and average balances, which do not fully explain the trends of the net interest margin during the year. The quarterly net interest margins are as follows:\n\nWe continued to experience downward pressure on our yield in interest-earning assets resulting from a protracted period of historically low rates and heightened competition for assets throughout the banking industry. The development of a stronger asset mix from increased loan balances, while actively bringing down interest expense and optimizing funding costs, remains a focus. We believe improvements in margin will be achieved through continued deployment of our liquid funds at higher yields as we redeploy cash into investment securities and loans.\nManagement attempts to mitigate the effects of an unpredictable interest-rate environment through effective portfolio management, prudent loan underwriting and operational efficiencies.\nOther Income\n\nTotal other income of $64.8 million increased $5.9 million from $58.9 million in 2014. Total other income of $58.9 million in 2014 decreased $3.7 million from $62.6 million in 2013.\nCombined wealth management revenue, consisting of trust fees and commissions and broker's fees, net, of $23.5 million in 2015 rose $1.2 million from $22.3 million in 2014 and 2014 income rose $1.4 million from $20.9 million in 2013. Growth in new assets under care (\u201cAUC\u201d), driven by our wealth management teams in 2015 and 2014, impacts fee income as wealth management revenues are typically correlated to levels of AUC. Furthermore, the Company believes the boutique services offered by Trevett Capital Partners within its suite of wealth services broadens its business base and enhances its ability to further develop revenue sources. In addition, our professional farm management and brokerage services are entrusted to care and maximize value for landowners of prime farmland in Illinois.\nRemittance processing revenue relates to our payment processing company, FirsTech. FirsTech's revenue of $11.1 million in 2015 increased 18.0% compared to $9.4 million in 2014 and revenue of $9.4 million in 2014 increased 12.8% compared to $8.4 million in 2013. The increases were primarily due to growth in electronic processing revenues, including online and mobile services. FirsTech adds important diversity to our revenue stream while widening our array of service offerings to larger commercial clients within our footprint and nationally.\nOverall, service charges on deposit accounts combined with other service charges and fees increased to $19.1 million in 2015 as compared to $18.3 million in 2014 and increased in 2014 as compared to $17.9 million in 2013. Evolving regulation, product changes and changing behaviors by our client base may impact the revenue derived from charges on deposit accounts.\nGain on sales of loans of $5.8 million in 2015 increased $1.1 million compared to $4.7 million in 2014. Gain on sales of loans of $4.7 million in 2014 decreased $5.5 million compared to $10.2 million in 2013. Fluctuations in gain on sales of loans is predominantly based on residential mortgage activity.\nSecurity gains, net, of $0.4 million in 2015 decreased compared to $0.8 million in 2014 but increased in 2014 compared to $0.6 million in 2013. Security gains, net, vary based on the Company's decisions around selling securities.\nOther income of $4.9 million in 2015 increased as compared to $3.5 million in 2014 and decreased in 2014 as compared to $4.6 million in 2013. The decrease in 2014 related to private equity investment losses and fluctuations across multiple revenue sources.\nOther Expense\n\nTotal other expense of $115.3 million in 2015 increased by $7.1 million as compared to $108.2 million in 2014 but decreased by $4.1 million in 2014 as compared to $112.3 million in 2013. In 2015, total other expense was influenced by the Herget Financial acquisition and other non-recurring expenses during the first quarter of 2015. In 2014, the Company focused on cost control initiatives, which broadly reduced operating expenses. We continue to examine all areas of the Company, seeking sensible opportunities to reduce cost and enhance efficiency. Following the anticipated Merger with Pulaski, one time charges relating to the integration of Pulaski may have a negative impact on expenses in 2016.\nTotal compensation expense increased to $63.5 million in 2015 as compared to $61.3 million in 2014 but decreased in 2014 as compared to $63.8 million in 2013. The 2015 increase over 2014 was due to higher commissions related to mortgage production, first quarter restructuring expenses, and an initial increase in the number of employees in connection with the Herget Financial acquisition. Cost containment efforts and personnel reductions starting in 2013 contributed to positive expense trends from 2013 to 2014.\nCombined net occupancy expense of premises and furniture and equipment expenses of $13.7 million in 2015 increased as compared to $13.2 million in 2014 but decreased in 2014 as compared to $13.3 million in 2013. We continue to evaluate our operations for appropriate cost control measures while seeking improvements in service delivery to our customers.\nData processing expense increased 18.9% in 2015 to $12.9 million as compared to $10.9 million in 2014 and increased 4.0% in 2014 as compared to $10.5 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to non-recurring software conversion expenses related to the acquisition of Herget Financial. A portion of the increase was also related to supporting new sources of revenue growth at FirsTech. As the Company manages data processing expense, it continues to enhance its mobile and internet banking services and prioritize strategies to mitigate the risk from cybercriminals through the use of new technology, industry best practices and customer education.\nAmortization of intangible assets increased in 2015 to $3.2 million as compared to $2.9 million in 2014 as a result of the January 8, 2015 Herget Financial acquisition. Amortization of intangible assets decreased in 2014 as compared to $3.1 million in 2013.\nRegulatory expense increased 13.4% in 2015 to $2.4 million as compared to $2.1 million in 2014. Regulatory expense decreased 9.2% in 2014 as compared to $2.3 million in 2013. On January 21, 2016, the FDIC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\u201cNPR\u201d) on proposed refinements to the deposit insurance assessment system for small insured depository institutions (generally, those institutions with less than $10 billion in total assets). The NPR revised an NPR adopted by the board on June 16, 2015 in response to comments received. The refinements would become operative the quarter after the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund reaches 1.15%. The Company projects that the proposal would be favorable to our annual cost of FDIC insurance.\nOther expense of $19.6 million in 2015 increased $1.8 million as compared to $17.8 million in 2014 and decreased $1.5 million in 2014 as compared to $19.3 million in 2013. The 2015 increase was the result of restructuring initiatives, which included $0.7 million in fixed asset impairments, $0.6 million of acquisition related expenses and $0.2 million in costs exploring other strategic growth opportunities. The 2014 decrease was the result of actions taken starting in early 2013 for widespread reductions in expenses due to an enhanced emphasis on cost control.\nThe effective rate on income taxes, or income taxes divided by income before taxes, of 34.7%, 34.9% and 32.9% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, was lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately 40% due to fairly stable amounts of tax preferred interest income, such as municipal bond interest and bank owned life insurance income, accounting for a portion of our taxable income. As taxable income increases, we expect our effective tax rate to increase. Under current law, Illinois net operating loss carryover limitations expired in 2014 and the corporate income tax rate decreased as of January 1, 2015. The Company continues to monitor evolving state tax legislation and its potential impact on operations on an ongoing basis.\nThe efficiency ratio represents total other expense, less amortization charges, as a percentage of tax-equivalent net interest income plus other income, less security gains and losses. The efficiency ratio, which is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used by management and the investment community in the banking industry, measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. The efficiency ratio improved in 2015 to 62.8% as compared to 65.1% in 2014 and 66.4% in 2013. We will continue to examine appropriate avenues to improve efficiency, as a focus in future periods, with an emphasis on revenue growth.\nBalance Sheet\n\nTotal assets increased by $333.4 million, or 9.1%, to $4.00 billion at December 31, 2015, as compared to $3.67 billion at December 31, 2014. Securities increased by $123.2 million, or 16.2%, at December 31, 2015, compared to December 31, 2014 as a result of the Herget Financial acquisition and deployment of cash into the securities portfolio. Loans, net increased by $221.4 million, or 9.3%, at December 31, 2015, compared to December 31, 2014, impacted by organic growth and the benefit of loans obtained as part of the Herget Financial acquisition.\nTotal liabilities increased by $393.8 million, or 12.2%, to $3.63 billion at December 31, 2015 compared to $3.23 billion at December 31, 2014. Total deposits increased by $388.3 million, or 13.4%, at December 31, 2015, compared to December 31, 2014 as the Company remains strongly core deposit funded, with solid liquidity and significant market share in the communities it serves. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $25.9 million, or 13.0%, due to fluctuations in customer balances. The Company borrowed $30.0 million in 2015, in addition to $50.0 million in 2014, of long-term debt from the FHLB, which is at variable rates and prepayable, as part of its ongoing balance sheet strategy.\nStockholders' equity decreased to $373.2 million at December 31, 2015, as compared to $433.6 million at December 31, 2014. On December 18, 2015, the Company redeemed all of the 72,664 shares of its Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C, that had been issued to the United States Department of Treasury pursuant to the SBLF program. The shares were redeemed at their liquidation value of $1,000 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends to, but excluding December 18, 2015. 2015 earnings, partially offset by dividends paid on preferred and common stock also impacted stockholders' equity.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company has classified the majority of its investment securities as available for sale. Securities available for sale are carried at fair value. Securities held to maturity are carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of securities available for sale was $834.8 million and the amortized cost was $830.9 million. There were $6.2 million of gross unrealized gains and $2.3 million of gross unrealized losses for a net unrealized gain of $3.9 million. The unrealized gain, net of tax, of $2.3 million has been included in stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2015, the cost of securities held to maturity was $49.8 million and the fair value was $50.3 million.\nThe composition of securities available for sale was as follows:\n\nThe Company had $49.8 million, $2.4 million and $0.8 million of securities classified as held to maturity at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. There were no held to maturity securities in the prior years. Held to maturity securities are primarily obligations of states and political subdivisions. The increase in securities classified as held to maturity in 2015 primarily relates to the Herget Financial acquisition.\nThe primary purposes of the investment portfolio include providing a source of liquidity, providing collateral for pledging purposes against public monies and repurchase agreements, serving as a tool for interest rate risk positioning and providing a source of earnings by deploying funds which are not needed to fulfill loan demand, deposit redemptions or other liquidity purposes. Pledged securities totaled $627.4 million, or 70.9% of total securities, and $536.2 million, or 70.4% of total securities at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe maturities, fair values and weighted average yields of securities available for sale and held to maturity as of December 31, 2015 were:\n\n\n(1) Securities are presented based upon final contractual maturity or pre-refunded date.\n(2) Excludes mutual funds and other equity securities.\n(3) Securities with floating rates are assumed to remain constant at their rates as of December 31, 2015.\n(4) Weighted average yield calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%.\nOverall in 2015, the investment portfolio increased by 16.2% as a result of the Herget Financial acquisition and deployment of cash into the securities portfolio. We consider many factors in determining the composition of our investment portfolio including, but not limited to, credit quality, duration, interest rate risk, liquidity, tax-equivalent yield, regulatory and overall portfolio allocation. As of December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any non-U.S. Treasury securities or obligations of U.S. government corporations and agencies issued securities that exceeded 10% of the Company's total stockholders' equity.\nLoan Portfolio\nThe composition of our loan portfolio as of the dates indicated was as follows:\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 of First Busey and subsidiaries. It should be read in conjunction with \u201cItem 1. Business,\u201d \u201cItem 6. Selected Financial Data,\u201d the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those that are critical to the portrayal and understanding of First Busey's financial condition and results of operations and require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex. These estimates involve judgments, estimates and uncertainties that are susceptible to change. In the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, and depending on the severity of such changes, the possibility of a materially different financial condition or materially different results of operations is a reasonable likelihood.\nFirst Busey's significant accounting policies are described in \u201cNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The majority of these accounting policies do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates or the variability of the estimates is not material. However, the following policies could be deemed critical:\nFair Value of Investment Securities. Securities are classified as held to maturity when First Busey has the ability and management has the positive intent to hold those securities to maturity. Accordingly, they are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. First Busey had $49.8 million of securities classified as held to maturity at December 31, 2015. First Busey had no securities classified as trading at December 31, 2015. Securities are classified as available for sale when First Busey may decide to sell those securities due to changes in market interest rates, liquidity needs, changes in yields on alternative investments, and for other reasons. They are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2015, First Busey had $834.8 million of securities classified as available for sale. For equity securities, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are utilized to determine fair value at the measurement date. For all other securities, we obtain fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the security's terms and conditions, among other things. Due to the limited nature of the market for certain securities, the fair value and potential sale proceeds could be materially different in the event of a sale.\nRealized securities gains or losses are reported in security gains (losses), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Declines in the fair value of securities below their amortized cost are evaluated to determine whether they are temporary or OTTI. If the Company (a) has the intent to sell a debt security or (b) will more likely than not be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery, then the Company recognizes the entire unrealized loss in earnings as an OTTI loss. If neither of these conditions are met, the Company evaluates whether a credit loss exists. The impairment is separated into the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss and the amount of total impairment related to all other factors. The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nThe Company also evaluates whether the decline in fair value of an equity security is temporary or OTTI. In determining whether an unrealized loss on an equity security is temporary or OTTI, management considers various factors including the magnitude and duration of the impairment, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to hold the equity security to forecasted recovery.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. First Busey has established an allowance for loan losses which represents its estimate of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements and reduces the total loans outstanding by an estimate of uncollectible loans. Loans deemed uncollectible are charged against and reduce the allowance. A provision for loan losses is charged to current expense. This provision acts to replenish the allowance for loan losses and to maintain the allowance at a level that management deems adequate.\nTo determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, a formal analysis is completed quarterly to assess the risk within the loan portfolio. This assessment is reviewed by senior management of Busey Bank and the Company. The analysis includes a review of historical performance, dollar amount and trends of past due loans, dollar amount and trends in non-performing loans, certain impaired loans, and loans identified as sensitive assets. Sensitive assets include non-accrual loans, past-due loans, loans on First Busey's watch loan reports and other loans identified as having probable potential for loss.\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component considers loans that are classified as impaired. For such loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying amount of that loan. The general component covers non-classified loans and classified loans not considered impaired, and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. Other adjustments may be made to the allowance for pools of loans after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss experience.\nA loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable First Busey will not be able to collect all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan becomes impaired, management generally calculates the impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. If the loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of the collateral is used to measure the amount of impairment. The amount of impairment and any subsequent changes are recorded through a charge to the provision for loan losses. For collateral dependent loans, First Busey has determined the required allowance on these loans based upon the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the applicable collateral. The required allowance or actual losses on these impaired loans could differ significantly if the ultimate fair value of the collateral is significantly different from the fair value estimates used by First Busey in estimating such potential losses.\nDeferred Taxes. We have maintained significant net deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences, the largest of which relates to the allowance for loan losses. For income tax return purposes, only actual charge-offs are deductible, not the provision for loan losses. Under generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, the forecasts of future income, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of the current and future economic and business conditions. We consider both positive and negative evidence regarding the ultimate recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Positive evidence includes available tax planning strategies and the probability that taxable income will continue to be generated in future periods, as it was in periods since March 31, 2010, while negative evidence includes a cumulative loss in 2009 and 2008 and certain business and economic trends. We evaluated the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and established a valuation allowance for certain state net operating loss and credit carryforwards that are not expected to be fully realized. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the other deferred tax assets included in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements will be fully realized. We determined that no valuation allowance was required for any other deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015, although there is no guarantee that those assets will be recognizable in future periods.\nWe assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is not more likely than not. In making this assessment, we must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income, and the possible application of future tax planning strategies.\nExecutive Summary\nOperating Results\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income by subsidiary:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Busey Bank\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FirsTech\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Busey Wealth Management\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated earnings per share, fully-diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Performance\nFirst Busey Corporation's net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $39.0 million and net income available to common stockholders was $38.3 million, or $1.32 per fully-diluted common share, compared to net income of $32.8 million and net income available to common stockholders of $32.0 million, or $1.10 per fully-diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2014. On January 8, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Herget Financial, which impacted year-to-date net income by $1.0 million in one-time expenses, occurring primarily in the first quarter of 2015. Further, the Company undertook initiatives to refine its branch network and restructure various internal teams during the first quarter of 2015, resulting in $0.7 million of fixed asset impairments and $0.3 million in other corporate restructuring costs.\nFollowing an extensive analysis of both customer needs and stockholder value, we consolidated three full service branches on July 30, 2015 and consolidated one additional branch on December 1, 2015. As we successfully service many emerging customer preferences through enhanced digital and telephone support, we have also modified hours where appropriate in our remaining thirty-five branch network to better match patterns of customer usage and added online scheduling capabilities. Our streamlined retail network will continue as a dynamic funding source with a relationship-driven focus to help our customers and communities flourish.\nOn December 3, 2015, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement with Pulaski, pursuant to which Pulaski will merge into First Busey, with First Busey as the surviving corporation. It is anticipated that Pulaski Bank, Pulaski's wholly-owned bank subsidiary, will be merged with and into Busey Bank, at a date following the completion of the holding company merger. At the time of the bank merger, Pulaski Bank's branches will become branches of Busey Bank. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago has approved the Merger and it is anticipated to be completed in the first half of 2016, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions in the Merger Agreement and the approval of the stockholders of both Pulaski and First Busey. The merger with Pulaski will allow the Company to significantly expand its geographic presence through a premier St. Louis banking franchise with an almost 100-year history and a strong regional mortgage presence. As of December 31, 2015, Pulaski had total consolidated assets of $1.65 billion, total loans of $1.41 billion and total deposits of $1.21 billion.\nSignificant operating performance items were:\n\u00b7 Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $111.8 million compared to $101.6 million for year ended December 31, 2014. 2015 net interest income included a net interest recovery on non-accrual loans of $0.9 million. The Federal Open Market Committee announced that effective December 17, 2015 the federal funds rate increased from 0.25% to 0.50%. The Company expects this increase in interest rates to be modestly favorable to net interest income in the next year.\n\u00b7 The net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased to 3.10% compared to 3.15% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\u00b7 The efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 improved to 62.84% from 65.11% for the same period of 2014. During 2015, various actions were undertaken to shape the future, trimming certain areas where sensible and adding in others with a continuing commitment to deliver optimal value to our stockholders. Following the anticipated Merger with Pulaski, one time charges relating to the integration of Pulaski may have a negative impact on the efficiency ratio in 2016.\n\u00b7 FirsTech's net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $1.7 million increased from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to growth in electronic processing revenues, including online and mobile services. FirsTech offers sophisticated payment processing capabilities and adds important diversity to our revenue stream while widening our array of service offerings to larger commercial clients.\n\u00b7 Busey Wealth Management's net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $4.6 million compared to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company believes the boutique services offered to ultra- high net worth clients by Trevett Capital Partners within its suite of wealth services broadens the Company's business base and enhances its ability to develop revenue sources in future years. In addition, our professional farm management and brokerage services are entrusted to care and maximize value for landowners of prime farmland in Illinois.\n\u00b7 Revenues from trust fees, commissions and brokers' fees, and remittance processing activities represented 53.4% of the Company's non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015, providing a balance to revenue from traditional banking activities. Trust fees and commission and brokers' fees increased to $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Remittance processing revenue increased to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $9.4 million, up 18.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAsset Quality\nWhile much internal focus has been directed toward growth, the Company's remains committed to credit quality. The December 31, 2015 asset metrics reflect the post combination results of acquiring Herget. As of December 31, 2015, the Company reported non-performing loans of $12.8 million compared to $9.0 million as of December 31, 2014. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans and non-performing assets continued to be low at 0.51% at December 31, 2015. With a continued commitment to the quality of assets and the strength of our balance sheet, near-term loan losses are expected to remain generally low. Asset quality metrics can be generally influenced by market-specific economic conditions beyond the control of the Company, and specific measures may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. The key metrics are as follows:\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of and for the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,637,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,415,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-performing loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-accrual loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans 90+ days past due\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-performing loans, segregated by geography\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Illinois/ Indiana\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Florida\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans 30-89 days past due\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-performing assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-performing assets to total loans and non-performing assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.51\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 0.38\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance as a percentage of non-performing loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 372.07\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 526.67\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses to loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.80\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 1.96\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operation - Three Years Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income and fees earned on earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate levels and volume fluctuations within earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income. Net interest margin is tax-equivalent net interest income as a percent of average earning assets.\nCertain assets with tax favorable treatment are evaluated on a tax-equivalent basis. Tax-equivalent basis assumes a federal income tax rate of 35%. Tax favorable assets generally have lower contractual pre-tax yields than fully taxable assets. A tax-equivalent analysis is performed by adding the tax savings to the earnings on tax favorable assets. After factoring in the tax favorable effects of these assets, the yields may be more appropriately evaluated against alternative earning assets. In addition to yield, various other risks are factored into the evaluation process.\nThe following tables show our consolidated average balance sheets, detailing the major categories of assets and liabilities, the interest income earned on interest-earning assets, the interest expense paid for the interest-bearing liabilities, and the related interest rates for the periods shown. The tables also show, for the periods indicated, a summary of the changes in interest earned and interest expense resulting from changes in volume and rates for the major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. All average information is provided on a daily average basis.\nAverage Balance Sheets and Interest Rates\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td>

income tax rate of 35%.\nEarning Assets, Sources of Funds, and Net Interest Margin\nTotal average interest-earning assets increased $386.1 million, or 11.7%, to $3.68 billion in 2015, as compared to $3.29 billion in 2014. Total average interest-earning assets increased $36.3 million, or 1.1%, to $3.29 billion in 2014, as compared to $3.25 billion in 2013. Average loans increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily due to our continued emphasis on organic commercial loan growth supplemented in 2015 by the Herget Financial acquisition; however, loans were added at lower yields than in 2013 due to the competitive lending environment. Loans generally have notably higher yields compared to interest-bearing bank deposits and investment securities. Our loan growth contributed to a positive effect on net interest margin which helped offset the downward pressure of a lower rate environment.\nTotal average interest-bearing liability balances increased $245.2 million, or 9.8%, to $2.74 billion in 2015, as compared to $2.49 billion in 2014. Total average interest-bearing liability balances decreased $66.7 million, or 2.6%, to $2.49 billion in 2014, as compared to $2.56 billion in 2013. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $121.8 million, or 20.4%, to $717.9 million in 2015, as compared to $596.1 million in 2014. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $64.4 million, or 12.1%, to $596.1 million in 2014, as compared to $531.7 million in 2013. Average non-interest bearing deposits represented 22.7% of total average deposits in 2015. The Company remains strongly core deposit funded with total average deposits in 2015 representing 91.0% of total average liabilities, with solid liquidity and significant market share in the communities we serve.\nInterest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $10.1 million, or 9.2%, to $120.2 million in 2015, from $110.1 million in 2014. The interest income increase related primarily to the increase in loan volumes, as discussed above. Interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased $1.0 million, or 0.9%, to $110.1 million in 2014, from $111.1 million in 2013. The interest income decline in 2014 related primarily to lower yields earned on assets in a low interest rate environment.\nInterest expense decreased during 2015 by $0.3 million, or 4.5%, to $6.2 million from $6.5 million in 2014. Interest expense decreased during 2014 by $2.1 million, or 24.7%, to $6.5 million from $8.6 million in 2013. The decreases in interest expense during the past two years were a result of favorable changes in funding mix and decreases in interest rates offered by the Company on certain deposit products as the interest rate environment remained low.\nNet interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $10.4 million, or 10.0%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. Net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $1.2 million, or 1.14%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. The Federal Open Market Committee announced that effective December 17, 2015, the federal funds rate increased from 0.25% to 0.50%. The Company expects this increase in interest rates to be modestly favorable to net interest income in the next year.\nNet interest margin, our net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets stated on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 3.10% in 2015 compared to 3.15% in 2014 and 2013. The net interest spread, which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, also on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.04% in 2015 compared to 3.09% in 2014 and 3.07% in 2013.\nThe net interest margin discussion above is based upon annual results and average balances, which do not fully explain the trends of the net interest margin during the year. The quarterly net interest margins are as follows:\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.03\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 3.13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 3.10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.05\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 3.13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 3.17\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 3.19\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 3.20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 3.13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 3.12\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe continued to experience downward pressure on our yield in interest-earning assets resulting from a protracted period of historically low rates and heightened competition for assets throughout the banking industry. The development of a stronger asset mix from increased loan balances, while actively bringing down interest expense and optimizing funding costs, remains a focus. We believe improvements in margin will be achieved through continued deployment of our liquid funds at higher yields as we redeploy cash into investment securities and loans.\nManagement attempts to mitigate the effects of an unpredictable interest-rate environment through effective portfolio management, prudent loan underwriting and operational efficiencies.\nOther Income\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trust fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commissions and brokers' fees, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 2,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remittance processing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 9,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 12,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other service charges and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 6,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sales of loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 4,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,504\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (53.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Security gains, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (396\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (51.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 3,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,134\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (24.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 62,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,642\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (5.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal other income of $64.8 million increased $5.9 million from $58.9 million in 2014. Total other income of $58.9 million in 2014 decreased $3.7 million from $62.6 million in 2013.\nCombined wealth management revenue, consisting of trust fees and commissions and broker's fees, net, of $23.5 million in 2015 rose $1.2 million from $22.3 million in 2014 and 2014 income rose $1.4 million from $20.9 million in 2013. Growth in new assets under care (\u201cAUC\u201d), driven by our wealth management teams in 2015 and 2014, impacts fee income as wealth management revenues are typically correlated to levels of AUC. Furthermore, the Company believes the boutique services offered by Trevett Capital Partners within its suite of wealth services broadens its business base and enhances its ability to further develop revenue sources. In addition, our professional farm management and brokerage services are entrusted to care and maximize value for landowners of prime farmland in Illinois.\nRemittance processing revenue relates to our payment processing company, FirsTech. FirsTech's revenue of $11.1 million in 2015 increased 18.0% compared to $9.4 million in 2014 and revenue of $9.4 million in 2014 increased 12.8% compared to $8.4 million in 2013. The increases were primarily due to growth in electronic processing revenues, including online and mobile services. FirsTech adds important diversity to our revenue stream while widening our array of service offerings to larger commercial clients within our footprint and nationally.\nOverall, service charges on deposit accounts combined with other service charges and fees increased to $19.1 million in 2015 as compared to $18.3 million in 2014 and increased in 2014 as compared to $17.9 million in 2013. Evolving regulation, product changes and changing behaviors by our client base may impact the revenue derived from charges on deposit accounts.\nGain on sales of loans of $5.8 million in 2015 increased $1.1 million compared to $4.7 million in 2014. Gain on sales of loans of $4.7 million in 2014 decreased $5.5 million compared to $10.2 million in 2013. Fluctuations in gain on sales of loans is predominantly based on residential mortgage activity.\nSecurity gains, net, of $0.4 million in 2015 decreased compared to $0.8 million in 2014 but increased in 2014 compared to $0.6 million in 2013. Security gains, net, vary based on the Company's decisions around selling securities.\nOther income of $4.9 million in 2015 increased as compared to $3.5 million in 2014 and decreased in 2014 as compared to $4.6 million in 2013. The decrease in 2014 related to private equity investment losses and fluctuations across multiple revenue sources.\nOther Expense\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December

compared to $108.2 million in 2014 but decreased by $4.1 million in 2014 as compared to $112.3 million in 2013. In 2015, total other expense was influenced by the Herget Financial acquisition and other non-recurring expenses during the first quarter of 2015. In 2014, the Company focused on cost control initiatives, which broadly reduced operating expenses. We continue to examine all areas of the Company, seeking sensible opportunities to reduce cost and enhance efficiency. Following the anticipated Merger with Pulaski, one time charges relating to the integration of Pulaski may have a negative impact on expenses in 2016.\nTotal compensation expense increased to $63.5 million in 2015 as compared to $61.3 million in 2014 but decreased in 2014 as compared to $63.8 million in 2013. The 2015 increase over 2014 was due to higher commissions related to mortgage production, first quarter restructuring expenses, and an initial increase in the number of employees in connection with the Herget Financial acquisition. Cost containment efforts and personnel reductions starting in 2013 contributed to positive expense trends from 2013 to 2014.\nCombined net occupancy expense of premises and furniture and equipment expenses of $13.7 million in 2015 increased as compared to $13.2 million in 2014 but decreased in 2014 as compared to $13.3 million in 2013. We continue to evaluate our operations for appropriate cost control measures while seeking improvements in service delivery to our customers.\nData processing expense increased 18.9% in 2015 to $12.9 million as compared to $10.9 million in 2014 and increased 4.0% in 2014 as compared to $10.5 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to non-recurring software conversion expenses related to the acquisition of Herget Financial. A portion of the increase was also related to supporting new sources of revenue growth at FirsTech. As the Company manages data processing expense, it continues to enhance its mobile and internet banking services and prioritize strategies to mitigate the risk from cybercriminals through the use of new technology, industry best practices and customer education.\nAmortization of intangible assets increased in 2015 to $3.2 million as compared to $2.9 million in 2014 as a result of the January 8, 2015 Herget Financial acquisition. Amortization of intangible assets decreased in 2014 as compared to $3.1 million in 2013.\nRegulatory expense increased 13.4% in 2015 to $2.4 million as compared to $2.1 million in 2014. Regulatory expense decreased 9.2% in 2014 as compared to $2.3 million in 2013. On January 21, 2016, the FDIC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\u201cNPR\u201d) on proposed refinements to the deposit insurance assessment system for small insured depository institutions (generally, those institutions with less than $10 billion in total assets). The NPR revised an NPR adopted by the board on June 16, 2015 in response to comments received. The refinements would become operative the quarter after the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund reaches 1.15%. The Company projects that the proposal would be favorable to our annual cost of FDIC insurance.\nOther expense of $19.6 million in 2015 increased $1.8 million as compared to $17.8 million in 2014 and decreased $1.5 million in 2014 as compared to $19.3 million in 2013. The 2015 increase was the result of restructuring initiatives, which included $0.7 million in fixed asset impairments, $0.6 million of acquisition related expenses and $0.2 million in costs exploring other strategic growth opportunities. The 2014 decrease was the result of actions taken starting in early 2013 for widespread reductions in expenses due to an enhanced emphasis on cost control.\nThe effective rate on income taxes, or income taxes divided by income before taxes, of 34.7%, 34.9% and 32.9% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, was lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately 40% due to fairly stable amounts of tax preferred interest income, such as municipal bond interest and bank owned life insurance income, accounting for a portion of our taxable income. As taxable income increases, we expect our effective tax rate to increase. Under current law, Illinois net operating loss carryover limitations expired in 2014 and the corporate income tax rate decreased as of January 1, 2015. The Company continues to monitor evolving state tax legislation and its potential impact on operations on an ongoing basis.\nThe efficiency ratio represents total other expense, less amortization charges, as a percentage of tax-equivalent net interest income plus other income, less security gains and losses. The efficiency ratio, which is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used by management and the investment community in the banking industry, measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. The efficiency ratio improved in 2015 to 62.8% as compared to 65.1% in 2014 and 66.4% in 2013. We will continue to examine appropriate avenues to improve efficiency, as a focus in future periods, with an emphasis on revenue growth.\nBalance Sheet\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> Significant Balance Sheet Items\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities, including available for sale and held to maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 884,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 761,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 123,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans, net, including loans held for sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,589,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,368,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 221,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,998,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,665,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 333,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposits:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest-bearing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 881,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 666,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 215,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest-bearing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,407,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,234,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 173,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,289,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,900,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 388,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities sold under agreements to repurchase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 172,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 198,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25,921\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (13.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,625,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,231,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 393,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stockholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 373,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 433,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (60,453\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (13.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal assets increased by $333.4 million, or 9.1%, to $4.00 billion at December 31, 2015, as compared to $3.67 billion at December 31, 2014.

Loans, net increased by $221.4 million, or 9.3%, at December 31, 2015, compared to December 31, 2014, impacted by organic growth and the benefit of loans obtained as part of the Herget Financial acquisition.\nTotal liabilities increased by $393.8 million, or 12.2%, to $3.63 billion at December 31, 2015 compared to $3.23 billion at December 31, 2014. Total deposits increased by $388.3 million, or 13.4%, at December 31, 2015, compared to December 31, 2014 as the Company remains strongly core deposit funded, with solid liquidity and significant market share in the communities it serves. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $25.9 million, or 13.0%, due to fluctuations in customer balances. The Company borrowed $30.0 million in 2015, in addition to $50.0 million in 2014, of long-term debt from the FHLB, which is at variable rates and prepayable, as part of its ongoing balance sheet strategy.\nStockholders' equity decreased to $373.2 million at December 31, 2015, as compared to $433.6 million at December 31, 2014.

The shares were redeemed at their liquidation value of $1,000 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends to, but excluding December 18, 2015. 2015 earnings, partially offset by dividends paid on preferred and common stock also impacted stockholders' equity.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company has classified the majority of its investment securities as available for sale. Securities available for sale are carried at fair value. Securities held to maturity are carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of securities available for sale was $834.8 million and the amortized cost was $830.9 million. There were $6.2 million of gross unrealized gains and $2.3 million of gross unrealized losses for a net unrealized gain of $3.9 million. The unrealized gain, net of tax, of $2.3 million has been included in stockholders' equity.
