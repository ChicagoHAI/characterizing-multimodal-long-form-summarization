Examples of forward-looking statements, include, without limitation, those relating to the Company's future business prospects and strategies, financial results, working capital, liquidity, capital needs and expenditures, interest costs, insurance availability and contingent liabilities. Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company's actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the Company's ability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt and lease obligations and to fund the Company's capital improvement projects to expand, redevelop, and/or reposition its senior living communities; the Company's ability to obtain additional capital on terms acceptable to it; the Company's ability to extend or refinance its existing debt as such debt matures; the Company's compliance with its debt and lease agreements, including certain financial covenants, and the risk of cross-default in the event such non-compliance occurs; the Company's ability to complete acquisitions and dispositions upon favorable terms or at all; the risk of oversupply and increased competition in the markets which the Company operates; the risk of increased competition for skilled workers due to wage pressure and changes in regulatory requirements; the departure of the Company's key officers and personnel; the cost and difficulty of complying with applicable licensure, legislative oversight, or regulatory changes; the risks associated with a decline in economic conditions generally; the adequacy and continued availability of the Company's insurance policies and the Company's ability to recover any losses it sustains under such policies; changes in accounting principles and interpretations; and the other risks and factors identified from time to time in the Company's reports filed with the SEC.\nOverview\nThe following discussion and analysis addresses (i) the Company's results of operations on a historical consolidated basis for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, and (ii) liquidity and capital resources of the Company and should be read in conjunction with the Company's historical consolidated financial statements and the selected financial data contained elsewhere in this report.\nThe Company is one of the largest operators of senior housing communities in the United States. The Company's operating strategy is to provide value to its senior living residents by providing quality senior living services at reasonable prices, while achieving and sustaining a strong, competitive position within its geographically concentrated regions, as well as continuing to enhance the performance of its operations. The Company provides senior living services to the elderly, including independent living, assisted living, and memory care services at reasonable prices. Many of the Company's communities offer a continuum of care to meet its residents' needs as they change over time. This continuum of care, which integrates independent living, assisted living, and memory care, and is bridged by home care through independent home care agencies, sustains residents' autonomy and independence based on their physical and mental abilities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company operated 129 senior housing communities in 23 states with an aggregate capacity of approximately 16,500 residents, including 83 senior housing communities which the Company owned and 46 senior housing communities the Company leased.\nSignificant Financial and Operational Highlights\nThe Company primarily derives its revenue by providing senior living housing and services to the elderly. When comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2017, the Company generated total revenues of approximately $460.0 million compared to total revenues of approximately $467.0 million, respectively, representing a decrease of approximately $7.0 million, or 1.5%. Our resident revenue continues to be negatively impacted from the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which resulted in the full evacuation of our residents at two of our senior housing communities located in southeast Texas during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Although physical repairs were substantially completed and both of these communities began accepting residents during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, unoccupied units at these communities resulted in a decrease of approximately $4.6 million in our resident revenue during fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017. In addition to the decrease in resident revenue from the two senior housing communities negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey, we also experienced a decrease in resident revenue at our other remaining senior housing communities of $2.4 million, which was primarily due to a 1.6% decrease in average financial occupancies.\nExcluding the two senior housing communities impacted by Hurricane Harvey, the weighted average financial occupancy rate for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was 85.2% and 86.8%, respectively. Although our occupancies declined, we achieved a 1.0% increase in average monthly rental rates when comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2017. The increase in average monthly rental rates during fiscal 2018 was primarily the result of annual rent increases for our existing residents and the capital improvements we have invested in our communities for unit conversions which enable us to provide a broader range of senior living services at higher levels of care.\nOn December 18, 2018, the Company repaid certain mortgage loans associated with 21 of its senior living communities totaling approximately $170.6 million from Fannie Mae which were scheduled to mature on various dates beginning August 2021 through April 2026. The repayment of these mortgage loans facilitated the establishment of a Master Credit Facility (the MCF\u201d) with Berkadia Commercial Mortgage ( Berkadia\u201d) whereby the Company obtained approximately $201.0 million of new mortgage financing. The MCF has a 10-year term, is interest only for the first 36 months, and will allow the Company to make future advances, should the Company decide to do so, assuming certain borrowing conditions are satisfied.\nOn December 18, 2018, the Company completed mortgage financing of $3.5 million from Berkadia at a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.75% on one community located in Kokomo, Indiana. The mortgage loan is interest-only and has an 18-month term maturing in July 2020.\nOn November 30, 2018, the Company completed supplemental mortgage financing of approximately $1.8 million from Fannie Mae at a fixed interest rate of 6.30% on one community located in Mesquite, Texas. The supplemental mortgage loan is coterminous, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the original existing mortgage debt maturing in July 2024.\nAs mentioned above, the Company had two of its senior housing communities located in southeast Texas impacted by Hurricane Harvey during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We maintain insurance coverage on these communities which includes damage caused by flooding. The insurance claim for this incident required a deductible of $100,000 that was expensed as a component of operating expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Physical repairs have been substantially completed to restore the communities to their condition prior to the incident and these communities reopened and began accepting residents in July 2018. Through December 31, 2018, we have incurred approximately $6.9 million in clean-up and physical repair costs which we believe are probable of being recovered through insurance proceeds. In addition to the repairs of physical damage to the buildings, the Company's insurance coverage includes loss of business income ( Business Interruption\u201d). Business Interruption includes reimbursement for lost revenue as well as incremental expenses incurred as a result of the hurricane. The Company received payments from our insurance underwriters during fiscal 2018 totaling approximately $9.2 million of which approximately $5.1 million related to Business Interruption, which has been included as a reduction to operating expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nFacility Leases\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company leased 46 senior housing communities from certain real estate investment trusts ( REITs\u201d). The lease terms are generally for 10-15 years with renewal options for 5-20 years at the Company's option. Under these lease agreements, the Company is responsible for all operating costs, maintenance and repairs, insurance and property taxes. No new facility leases were entered into by the Company during fiscal 2018.\nVentas\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company leased seven senior housing communities (collectively the Ventas Lease Agreements\u201d) from Ventas, Inc. ( Ventas\u201d). Effective January 31, 2017, the Company acquired from Ventas the underlying real estate associated with four of its operating leases for a total acquisition price of $85.0 million (the Four Property Lease Transaction\u201d). The Company obtained interim, interest only, bridge financing from Berkadia for $65.0 million of the acquisition price with an initial variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.0% and a 36-month term, with an option to extend 6 months, and the balance of the acquisition price paid from the Company's existing cash resources. For additional information refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to consolidated financial statements. Prior to the Four Property Lease Transaction, the Company previously leased 11 senior housing communities from Ventas.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to facilitate up to $24.5 million of leasehold improvements for 10 communities within the Ventas lease portfolio and extend the lease terms until September 30, 2025, with two five-year renewal extensions available at the Company's option. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to increase the funds budgeted for leasehold improvements (the Special Project Funds\u201d) from $24.5 million to $28.5 million and extend the date for completion of the leasehold improvements to June 30, 2017. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to decrease the Special Project Funds for leasehold improvements from $28.5 million to approximately $17.0 million due to the Four Property Lease Transaction and extend the date for completion of the leasehold improvements to June 30, 2018. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to increase the Special Project Funds for leasehold improvements from approximately $17.0 million to approximately $20.0 million and extend the date for completion of the leasehold improvements to June 30, 2019. The initial lease rates under each of the Ventas Lease Agreements ranged from 6.75% to 8% and are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses which will be recognized when probable or incurred. The Company initially incurred $11.4 million in lease acquisition and modification costs related to the Ventas Lease Agreements, of which a portion of these costs were written-off upon closing the Four Property Lease Transaction leaving $8.7 million in lease acquisition and modification costs associated with the remaining properties. These deferred lease acquisition and modification costs are being amortized over the lease terms and are included in facility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company accounts for five of the Ventas Lease Agreements as an operating lease and two as a capital lease and financing obligation.\nHCP\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company leased 15 senior housing communities (collectively the HCP Lease Agreements\u201d) from HCP, Inc. ( HCP\u201d). During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company executed an amendment to the master lease agreement with HCP to facilitate up to $3.3 million of leasehold improvements for one community within the HCP lease portfolio and extend the initial lease terms for nine communities until October 31, 2020, with two 10-year renewal extensions available at the Company's option. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company exercised its right to extend the lease term with HCP for the remaining six communities in the HCP lease portfolio until April 30, 2026, with one 10-year renewal extension available at the Company's option. The initial lease rates under the HCP Lease Agreements ranged from 7.25% to 8% and are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses, which will be recognized when probable or incurred. The Company incurred $1.6 million in lease acquisition and modification costs related to the HCP Lease Agreements. These deferred lease acquisition and modification costs are being amortized over the lease terms and are included in facility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company accounts for each of the HCP Lease Agreements as an operating lease.\nWelltower\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company leased 24 senior housing communities (collectively the Welltower Lease Agreements\u201d) from Welltower, Inc., formerly Health Care REIT, Inc. ( Welltower\u201d). The Welltower Lease Agreements each have an initial term of 15 years, with one 15-year renewal extension available at the Company's option. The initial lease rates under the Welltower Lease Agreements ranged from 7.25% to 8.5% and are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses, which will be recognized when probable or incurred. The initial terms on the Welltower Lease Agreements expire on various dates through from April 2025 through April 2026. The Company incurred $2.1 million in lease acquisition costs related to the Welltower Lease Agreements. These deferred lease acquisition costs are being amortized over the lease terms and are included in facility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company accounts for each of the Welltower Lease Agreements as an operating lease.\nThe following table summarizes each of the Company's facility lease agreements as of December 31, 2018 (dollars

The Company was in compliance with all of its lease covenants at December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nDebt Transactions\nOn December 18, 2018, the Company repaid certain mortgage loans associated with 21 of its senior living communities totaling approximately $170.6 million from Fannie Mae which were scheduled to mature on various dates beginning August 2021 through April 2026. The repayment of these mortgage loans facilitated the establishment of a MCF with Berkadia whereby the Company obtained approximately $201.0 million of new mortgage financing. The MCF will allow the Company to make future advances, should the Company decide to do so, assuming certain borrowing conditions are satisfied. The MCF consists of two separate loans which are cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized. Approximately $150.8 million of the new financing is long-term fixed interest rate debt at a fixed interest rate of 5.13% with a 10-year term and interest only for the first 36 months and the principal amortized over a 30-year term thereafter. Approximately $50.3 million of the new financing is long-term variable interest rate debt at a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.14% with a 10-year term and interest only for the first 36 months and a fixed monthly principal component of $67,000 thereafter. The Company incurred approximately $3.0 million in deferred financing costs related to the MCF, which are being amortized over 10 years. As a result of the early repayment of the Fannie Mae mortgage debt, the Company accelerated the amortization of approximately $1.5 million in unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred prepayment premiums of approximately $11.1 million.\nOn December 18, 2018, the Company completed mortgage financing of $3.5 million from Berkadia at a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.75% on one community located in Kokomo, Indiana. The mortgage loan is interest-only and has an 18-month term maturing in July 2020.\nOn December 1, 2018, the Company renewed certain insurance policies and entered into a finance agreement totaling approximately $0.8 million. The finance agreement has a fixed interest rate of 4.40% with the principal being repaid over an 11-month term.\nOn November 30, 2018, the Company completed supplemental mortgage financing of approximately $1.8 million from Fannie Mae at a fixed interest rate of 6.30% on one community located in Mesquite, Texas. The supplemental mortgage loan is coterminous, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the original existing mortgage debt maturing in July 2024.\nEffective June 29, 2018, the Company extended its mortgage loan with Berkadia on one of its senior living communities located in Canton, Ohio. The maturity date was extended to October 10, 2021 with an initial variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 5.0% with principal amortized over 25 years.\nEffective May 31, 2018, the Company renewed certain insurance policies and entered into a finance agreement totaling approximately $1.7 million. The finance agreement has a fixed interest rate of 3.64% with the principal being repaid over an 11-month term.\nThe Company issued standby letters of credit with Wells Fargo Bank ( Wells Fargo\u201d), totaling approximately $3.4 million, for the benefit of Hartford Financial Services ( Hartford\u201d) associated with the administration of workers compensation which remain outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nThe Company issued standby letters of credit with JPMorgan Chase Bank ( Chase\u201d), totaling approximately $6.7 million, for the benefit of Welltower, on certain leases between Welltower and the Company which remain outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nThe Company issued standby letters of credit with Chase, totaling approximately $2.9 million, for the benefit of HCP on certain leases between HCP and the Company which remain outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience, observance of industry trends and various other sources of information and factors, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company believes the following are our most critical accounting policies and/or typically require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nResident revenue consists of fees for basic housing and certain support services and fees associated with additional housing and expanded support requirements such as assisted living care, memory care, and ancillary services. Basic housing and certain support services revenue is recorded when services are rendered and amounts billed are due from residents in the period in which the rental and other services are provided. Residency agreements are generally short term in nature with durations of one year or less and are typically terminable by either party, under certain circumstances, upon providing 30 days' notice, unless state law provides otherwise, with resident fees billed monthly in advance. Revenue for certain ancillary services is recognized as services are provided, and includes fees for services such as medication management, daily living activities, beautician/barber, laundry, television, guest meals, pets, and parking which are generally billed monthly in arrears.\nThe Company's senior housing communities have residency agreements which generally require the resident to pay a community fee prior to moving into the community and are recorded initially by the Company as deferred revenue. The deferred amounts are amortized over the respective residents' initial lease term which is consistent with the contractual obligation associated with the estimated stay of the resident.\nRevenues from the Medicaid program accounted for approximately 5.4% of the Company's revenue in fiscal 2018, 5.6% of the Company's revenue in fiscal 2017, and 5.5% of the Company's revenue in fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, 40, 41, and 40, respectively, of the Company's communities were providers of services under Medicaid programs. Accordingly, these communities were entitled to reimbursement under the foregoing program at established rates that were lower than private pay rates. Patient service revenue for Medicaid patients was recorded at the reimbursement rates as the rates were set prospectively by the applicable state upon the filing of an annual cost report. None of the Company's communities were providers of services under the Medicare program during fiscal 2018, 2017, or 2016.\nLaws and regulations governing the Medicaid program are complex and subject to interpretation. The Company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of potential wrongdoing. While no such regulatory inquiries have been made, compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as significant regulatory action including fines, penalties, and exclusion from the Medicaid program.\nPurchase Accounting\nIn determining the allocation of the purchase price of senior housing communities acquired to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, the Company makes estimates of fair value using information obtained as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, leasing activities and/or independent appraisals. The Company assigns the purchase price for senior living communities to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on\ntheir estimated fair values. The determination of fair value involves the use of significant judgments and estimates which is generally assessed as follows:\nThe Company allocates the fair values of buildings acquired on an as-if-vacant basis and depreciates the building values over the estimated remaining lives of the buildings, not to exceed 40 years. The Company determines the allocated values of other fixed assets, such as site improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment, based upon the replacement cost and depreciates such values over the assets' estimated remaining useful lives as determined at the acquisition date. The Company determines the value of land by considering the sales prices of similar properties in recent transactions.\nThe fair value of acquired lease-related intangibles reflects the estimated fair value of existing resident in-place leases as represented by the cost to obtain residents and an estimated absorption period to reflect the value of the rent and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period as if the property acquired was vacant. The Company amortizes any acquired resident in-place lease intangibles to depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated remaining useful life of the respective resident operating leases.\nCredit Risk and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company's resident receivables are generally due within 30 days from the date billed. Accounts receivable are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $6.8 million and $4.9 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and represent the Company's estimate of the amount that ultimately will be collected. The adequacy of the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends, write-off experience, analyses of receivable portfolios by payor source and aging of receivables, as well as a review of specific accounts, and adjustments are made to the allowance as necessary. Credit losses on resident receivables have historically been within management's estimates, and management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for expected losses.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2018.\nLease Accounting\nThe Company determines whether to account for its leases as operating, capital or financing leases depending on the underlying terms of each lease agreement. This determination of classification requires significant judgment relating to certain information, including the estimated fair value and remaining economic life of the community, the Company's cost of funds, minimum lease payments and other lease terms. The lease rates under the Company's lease agreements are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses which are recognized when probable or incurred and are based on changes in the consumer price index or certain operational performance measures. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company leased 46 communities, two of which the Company classified as capital lease and financing obligations with the remaining classified as operating leases. The Company incurs lease acquisition costs and amortizes these costs over the term of the respective lease agreement. Certain leases entered into by the Company qualified as sale/leaseback transactions, and as such, any related gains have been deferred and are being amortized over the respective lease term. No new communities were leased by the Company during fiscal 2018 or 2017. Effective January 31, 2017, the Company acquired from Ventas the underlying real estate associated with four of its operating leases. For additional information refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nFacility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive loss includes rent expense plus amortization expense relating to leasehold acquisition costs offset by the amortization of deferred gains and lease incentives.\nEmployee Health and Dental Benefits, Workers' Compensation, and Insurance Reserves\nThe Company offers full-time employees an option to participate in its health and dental plans. The Company is self-insured up to certain limits and is insured if claims in excess of these limits are incurred. The cost of employee\nhealth and dental benefits, net of employee contributions, is shared between the corporate office and the senior housing communities based on the respective number of plan participants. Funds collected are used to pay the actual program costs including estimated annual claims, third-party administrative fees, network provider fees, communication costs, and other related administrative costs incurred by the plans. Claims are paid as they are submitted to the Company's third-party administrator. The Company records a liability for outstanding claims and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. This liability is based on the historical claim reporting lag and payment trends of health insurance claims. Management believes that the liability for outstanding losses and expenses is adequate to cover the ultimate cost of losses and expenses incurred at December 31, 2018; however, actual claims and expenses may differ. Any subsequent changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\nThe Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance for workers' compensation. Determining the reserve for workers' compensation losses and costs that the Company has incurred as of the end of a reporting period involves significant judgments based on projected future events, including potential settlements for pending claims, known incidents which may result in claims, estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims, changes in insurance premiums, estimated litigation costs and other factors. The Company regularly adjusts these estimates to reflect changes in the foregoing factors. However, since this reserve is based on estimates, the actual expenses incurred may differ from the amounts reserved. Any subsequent changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\nLong-Lived Assets\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. At each balance sheet date, the Company reviews the carrying value of its property and equipment to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired or that the depreciation period may need to be changed. The Company considers internal factors such as net operating losses along with external factors relating to each asset, including contract changes, local market developments, and other publicly available information. If an indicator of impairment is identified, the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair market value, generally based on discounted cash flows, of the long-lived asset. For property and equipment where indicators of impairment were identified, tests of recoverability were performed and the Company has concluded its property and equipment is recoverable and does not warrant adjustment to the carrying value or remaining useful lives as of December 31, 2018. The Company does not believe there were any indicators of impairment that would require an adjustment to the carrying value of the property and equipment or their remaining useful lives as of December 31, 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method and current income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable. Deferred income taxes are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of loss carryforwards and temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect those carryforwards and temporary differences to be recovered or settled. Management regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance, if considered necessary, based on such evaluation. As part of the evaluation, management has evaluated taxable income in carryback years, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, feasible tax planning strategies, and future expectations of income. Based upon this evaluation, a valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce the Company's net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. However, in the event that we were to determine that it would be more likely than not that the Company would realize the benefit of deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts, adjustments to deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period we made such a determination. The benefits of the net deferred tax assets might not be realized if actual results differ from expectations. The effective tax rates for fiscal 2018 and 2017 differ from the statutory tax rates due to state income taxes, permanent tax differences, and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The Company is impacted by the Texas Margin Tax ( TMT\u201d), which effectively imposes tax on modified gross revenues for communities within the State of Texas. During each of fiscal 2018 and 2017, the Company consolidated 38 Texas communities and the TMT increased the overall provision for income taxes.\nThe Company evaluates uncertain tax positions through consideration of accounting and reporting guidance on criteria, measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition that is intended to provide better financial-statement comparability among different companies. The Company\nis required to recognize a tax benefit in its financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management's assessment is that its position is more likely than not\u201d (i.e., a greater than 50 percent likelihood) to be upheld on audit based only on the technical merits of the tax position. The Company's policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as income tax expense. The Company is generally no longer subject to federal and state income tax audits for years prior to 2015.\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-01, Business Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a Business. ASU 2017-01 provides guidance in accounting for business combinations when determining if the transaction represents acquisitions or disposals of assets or of a business. Under ASU 2017-01, when determining whether an integrated set of assets and activities constitutes a business, entities must compare the fair value of gross assets acquired to the fair value of a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in the single identifiable assets or group of similar identifiable assets, the integrated set of assets and activities is not characterized as a business. ASU 2017-01 is applied prospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-01 on January 1, 2018 and beginning from the date of adoption will apply the accounting guidance provided to the Company's acquisition activities. Management expects the adoption to require the accounting for acquisitions of senior housing communities to be reflected as acquisitions of assets rather than as a business combination; however, management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2017-01 to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). ASU 2016-18 requires an entity to include in its cash and cash-equivalent balances in the statement of cash flows those amounts that are deemed to be restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-18 on January 1, 2018 and the adoption resulted in the Company no longer reporting changes in restricted cash balances in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows within net cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities which did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 amends the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 230, which often requires judgment to determine the appropriate classification of cash flows as operating, investing or financing activities and has resulted in diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-15 on January 1, 2018 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require an incurred loss\u201d methodology for recognizing credit losses that delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. ASU 2016-13 replaces the current incurred loss methodology for credit losses and removes the thresholds that companies apply to measure credit losses on financial statements measured at amortized cost, such as loans, receivables, and held-to-maturity debt securities with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to form credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years and for interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. The new lease standard requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Additionally, in July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases, Targeted Improvements, which provided entities with a transition method option to not restate comparative periods presented, but to recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the period of adoption. The FASB retained a dual model for lease classification, requiring leases to be classified as finance or operating leases to determine recognition in the statements of operations and cash flows; however, substantially all leases will be required to be recognized on the balance sheet. The standards update will also require quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements and provides a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company expects to utilize certain practical expedients that, upon adoption, allows entities to (1) not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) retain the classification of leases (e.g., operating or finance lease) existing as of the date of adoption, (3) not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases, and (4) not record a right-of-use asset and related lease liability for leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less. The Company is in the final stages of evaluating its existing lease portfolio, including accumulating all of the necessary information required to properly account for leases under the new accounting guidance, and believes the most significant impact relates to its accounting for real estate leases. The Company plans to elect a transition option which allows for the recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption without recasting the financial statements in periods prior to adoption. At adoption, the Company expects to recognize a material increase in assets and liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet resulting from the recognition of lease liabilities initially measured at the present value of its future operating lease payments and the related right of use assets. The Company has concluded that the previously unrecognized right of use assets will be reviewed for impairment which could result in a reduction to the initially recognized right of use assets and a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of January 1, 2019. The Company continues to evaluate the impacts of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, and is updating its systems, processes, and internal controls to meet the new reporting and disclosure requirements. The adoption of this standard will have no impact on the Company's covenant compliance under its current debt and lease agreements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. Under ASU 2014-09, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018 under the modified retrospective approach. Under the modified retrospective approach, the guidance is applied to the most current period presented, recognizing the cumulative effect of the adoption to beginning retained earnings. The Company has determined that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not result in an adjustment to beginning retained earnings and did not result in significant changes to the amount and/or timing of revenue reported within the Company's consolidated financial statements; however, ASU 2014-09 requires enhanced disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue arrangements. Additionally, our contracts with residents are generally short term in nature and revenue is recognized when services are provided; as such, ASU 2014-09 provides an entity need not disclose information related to performance obligations when the performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less.\nResults of Operations\nThe following

2017\nRevenues\nResident revenue was $460.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $467.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $7.0 million, or 1.5%. The decrease in resident revenue primarily results from the negative impacts of Hurricane Harvey, which resulted in the full evacuation of our residents at two of our senior housing communities located in southeast Texas during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Although these communities reopened and began accepting residents in July 2018, unoccupied units at these communities resulted in a decrease of approximately $4.6 million in our resident revenue during fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017. Additionally, we experienced a decrease in resident revenue at our other remaining senior housing communities of $2.4 million primarily due to a 1.6% decrease in average financial occupancies.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses were $452.4 million during fiscal 2018 compared to $459.2 million during fiscal 2017, representing a decrease of $6.7 million, or 1.5%. This decrease is primarily the result of a $12.9 million loss on facility lease termination incurred by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and a $3.4 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $4.0 million increase in operating expenses, a $3.4 million increase in general and administrative expenses, a $1.2 million increase in provision for bad debts, a $0.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, and a $0.1 million increase in facility lease costs.\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The $12.9 million loss on facility lease termination is due to the Four Property Lease Transaction that closed on January 31, 2017, whereby the Company acquired the underlying real estate associated with four of the senior housing communities previously leased from Ventas.

The effective tax rates for fiscal 2018 and 2017 differ from the statutory tax rates due to state income taxes, permanent tax differences, and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The Company is impacted by the TMT, which effectively imposes tax on modified gross revenues for communities within the State of Texas. During each of fiscal 2018 and 2017, the Company consolidated 38 Texas communities and the TMT increased the overall provision for income taxes. The variation in benefit (provision) for income taxes was attributable to slightly lower state income taxes and final remeasurement adjustments from recent tax legislation changes associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA\u201d), which was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nManagement regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance, if considered necessary, based on such evaluation. As part of the evaluation, management has evaluated taxable income in carryback years, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, feasible tax planning strategies, and future expectations of income. Based upon this evaluation, adjustments to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $9.5 million and $5.9 million were recorded during fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, to reduce the Company's net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nNet loss and comprehensive loss\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, the Company reported net loss and comprehensive loss of $(53.6 million) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and net loss and comprehensive loss of $(44.2 million) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenues\nResident revenue was $467.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $447.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $19.5 million, or 4.4%. The increase in resident revenue primarily results from an increase of $15.3 million from a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and an increase of $4.3 million due to a 2.8% increase in average monthly rental rates at the Company's same-store communities which was primarily the result of annual rent increases for our existing residents and recent capital improvements we have invested in our communities for unit conversions which enable us to provide a broader range of senior living services at higher levels of care. The increase in resident revenue at our same-store communities was negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey which resulted in the full evacuation of our residents at two of our communities located in southeast Texas. Both of these communities were undergoing repairs and remained fully vacated at December 31, 2017, which resulted in a decrease in our same-store resident revenue of approximately $3.5 million.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses were $459.2 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $433.1 million during fiscal 2016, representing an increase of $26.1 million, or 6.0%. This increase is primarily the result of a $16.8 million increase in operating expenses, a $12.9 million loss on facility lease termination, and a $5.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, slightly offset by a $5.3 million decrease in facility lease expense and a $4.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense.\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The increase in operating expenses primarily results from an increase of $11.6 million from a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and an increase of $5.2 million at the Company's same-store communities primarily due to increased wages and benefits to employees for annual merit increases and incremental costs, including increased labor costs for additional staffing required for newly licensed memory care and assisted living units, to support changes in occupancy\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> with more of our residents at higher levels of care.

31, 2018, the Company's principal sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations, supplemental debt financings, additional proceeds from debt refinancings, equity issuances, and/or proceeds from the sale of assets. The Company expects its available cash and cash flows from operations, supplemental debt financings, additional proceeds from debt refinancings, and proceeds from the sale of assets to be sufficient to fund its short-term working capital requirements. The Company's long-term capital requirements, primarily for acquisitions and other corporate initiatives, could be dependent on its ability to access additional funds through joint ventures and the debt and/or equity markets. The Company from time to time considers and evaluates transactions related to its portfolio including supplemental debt financings, debt refinancings, equity issuances, purchases and sales of assets, reorganizations and other transactions. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that the Company will be able to obtain the capital necessary to meet the Company's short and long-term capital requirements.\nChanges in the current economic environment could result in decreases in the fair value of assets, slowing of transactions, and tightening liquidity and credit markets. These impacts could make securing debt for acquisitions or refinancings for the Company, its joint ventures, or buyers of the Company's properties more difficult or on terms not acceptable to the Company. Additionally, the Company may be more susceptible to being negatively impacted by operating or performance deficits based on the exposure associated with certain lease coverage requirements.\nIn summary, the Company's cash flows were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21,908\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (124,940\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (201,049\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,666\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 126,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase (Decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (16,299\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (21,923\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe Company had net cash provided by operating activities of $36.9 million, $55.6 million, and $52.3 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

However, inflation could affect the Company's future revenues and results of operations because of, among other things, the Company's dependence on senior residents, many of whom rely primarily on fixed incomes to pay for the Company's services. As a result, during inflationary periods, the Company may not be able to increase resident service fees to account fully for increased operating expenses. In structuring its fees, the Company attempts to anticipate inflation levels, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to anticipate fully or otherwise respond to any future inflationary pressures.\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am unable to identify the table you are referring to.\n- Could you please provide me with the table name or a description of the table so I can better assist you?\n- I'm sorry, but I am unable to understand your request because it seems to be incomplete.\n- Could you please provide me with more information so I can better assist you?\n- I'm sorry, but I am unable to understand your request because it appears to be malformed.\n- Could you please provide me with the correct request so I can better assist you?\n\nUnfortunately, I am unable to understand your request because you have not provided me with any information to work with.

The Company's operating strategy is to provide value to its senior living residents by providing quality senior living services at reasonable prices, while achieving and sustaining a strong, competitive position within its geographically concentrated regions, as well as continuing to enhance the performance of its operations. The Company provides senior living services to the elderly, including independent living, assisted living, and memory care services at reasonable prices. Many of the Company's communities offer a continuum of care to meet its residents' needs as they change over time. This continuum of care, which integrates independent living, assisted living, and memory care, and is bridged by home care through independent home care agencies, sustains residents' autonomy and independence based on their physical and mental abilities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company operated 129 senior housing communities in 23 states with an aggregate capacity of approximately 16,500 residents, including 83 senior housing communities which the Company owned and 46 senior housing communities the Company leased.\nSignificant Financial and Operational Highlights\nThe Company primarily derives its revenue by providing senior living housing and services to the elderly. When comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2017, the Company generated total revenues of approximately $460.0 million compared to total revenues of approximately $467.0 million, respectively, representing a decrease of approximately $7.0 million, or 1.5%. Our resident revenue continues to be negatively impacted from the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which resulted in the full evacuation of our residents at two of our senior housing communities located in southeast Texas during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Although physical repairs were substantially completed and both of these communities began accepting residents during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, unoccupied units at these communities resulted in a decrease of approximately $4.6 million in our resident revenue during fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017. In addition to the decrease in resident revenue from the two senior housing communities negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey, we also experienced a decrease in resident revenue at our other remaining senior housing communities of $2.4 million, which was primarily due to a 1.6% decrease in average financial occupancies.\nExcluding the two senior housing communities impacted by Hurricane Harvey, the weighted average financial occupancy rate for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was 85.2% and 86.8%, respectively. Although our occupancies declined, we achieved a 1.0% increase in average monthly rental rates when comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2017. The increase in average monthly rental rates during fiscal 2018 was primarily the result of annual rent increases for our existing residents and the capital improvements we have invested in our communities for unit conversions which enable us to provide a broader range of senior living services at higher levels of care.\nOn December 18, 2018, the Company repaid certain mortgage loans associated with 21 of its senior living communities totaling approximately $170.6 million from Fannie Mae which were scheduled to mature on various dates beginning August 2021 through April 2026. The repayment of these mortgage loans facilitated the establishment of a Master Credit Facility (the MCF\u201d) with Berkadia Commercial Mortgage ( Berkadia\u201d) whereby the Company obtained approximately $201.0 million of new mortgage financing. The MCF has a 10-year term, is interest only for the first 36 months, and will allow the Company to make future advances, should the Company decide to do so, assuming certain borrowing conditions are satisfied.\nOn December 18, 2018, the Company completed mortgage financing of $3.5 million from Berkadia at a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.75% on one community located in Kokomo, Indiana. The mortgage loan is interest-only and has an 18-month term maturing in July 2020.\nOn November 30, 2018, the Company completed supplemental mortgage financing of approximately $1.8 million from Fannie Mae at a fixed interest rate of 6.30% on one community located in Mesquite, Texas. The supplemental mortgage loan is coterminous, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the original existing mortgage debt maturing in July 2024.\nAs mentioned above, the Company had two of its senior housing communities located in southeast Texas impacted by Hurricane Harvey during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We maintain insurance coverage on these communities which includes damage caused by flooding. The insurance claim for this incident required a deductible of $100,000 that was expensed as a component of operating expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Physical repairs have been substantially completed to restore the communities to their condition prior to the incident and these communities reopened and began accepting residents in July 2018. Through December 31, 2018, we have incurred approximately $6.9 million in clean-up and physical repair costs which we believe are probable of being recovered through insurance proceeds. In addition to the repairs of physical damage to the buildings, the Company's insurance coverage includes loss of business income ( Business Interruption\u201d). Business Interruption includes reimbursement for lost revenue as well as incremental expenses incurred as a result of the hurricane. The Company received payments from our insurance underwriters during fiscal 2018 totaling approximately $9.2 million of which approximately $5.1 million related to Business Interruption, which has been included as a reduction to operating expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nFacility Leases\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company leased 46 senior housing communities from certain real estate investment trusts ( REITs\u201d). The lease terms are generally for 10-15 years with renewal options for 5-20 years at the Company's option. Under these lease agreements, the Company is responsible for all operating costs, maintenance and repairs, insurance and property taxes. No new facility leases were entered into by the Company during fiscal 2018.\nVentas\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company leased seven senior housing communities (collectively the Ventas Lease Agreements\u201d) from Ventas, Inc. ( Ventas\u201d). Effective January 31, 2017, the Company acquired from Ventas the underlying real estate associated with four of its operating leases for a total acquisition price of $85.0 million (the Four Property Lease Transaction\u201d). The Company obtained interim, interest only, bridge financing from Berkadia for $65.0 million of the acquisition price with an initial variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.0% and a 36-month term, with an option to extend 6 months, and the balance of the acquisition price paid from the Company's existing cash resources. For additional information refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to consolidated financial statements. Prior to the Four Property Lease Transaction, the Company previously leased 11 senior housing communities from Ventas.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to facilitate up to $24.5 million of leasehold improvements for 10 communities within the Ventas lease portfolio and extend the lease terms until September 30, 2025, with two five-year renewal extensions available at the Company's option. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to increase the funds budgeted for leasehold improvements (the Special Project Funds\u201d) from $24.5 million to $28.5 million and extend the date for completion of the leasehold improvements to June 30, 2017. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to decrease the Special Project Funds for leasehold improvements from $28.5 million to approximately $17.0 million due to the Four Property Lease Transaction and extend the date for completion of the leasehold improvements to June 30, 2018. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to increase the Special Project Funds for leasehold improvements from approximately $17.0 million to approximately $20.0 million and extend the date for completion of the leasehold improvements to June 30, 2019. The initial lease rates under each of the Ventas Lease Agreements ranged from 6.75% to 8% and are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses which will be recognized when probable or incurred. The Company initially incurred $11.4 million in lease acquisition and modification costs related to the Ventas Lease Agreements, of which a portion of these costs were written-off upon closing the Four Property Lease Transaction leaving $8.7 million in lease acquisition and modification costs associated with the remaining properties. These deferred lease acquisition and modification costs are being amortized over the lease terms and are included in facility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company accounts for five of the Ventas Lease Agreements as an operating lease and two as a capital lease and financing obligation.\nHCP\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company leased 15 senior housing communities (collectively the HCP Lease Agreements\u201d) from HCP, Inc. ( HCP\u201d). During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company executed an amendment to the master lease agreement with HCP to facilitate up to $3.3 million of leasehold improvements for one community within the HCP lease portfolio and extend the initial lease terms for nine communities until October 31, 2020, with two 10-year renewal extensions available at the Company's option. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company exercised its right to extend the lease term with HCP for the remaining six communities in the HCP lease portfolio until April 30, 2026, with one 10-year renewal extension available at the Company's option. The initial lease rates under the HCP Lease Agreements ranged from 7.25% to 8% and are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses, which will be recognized when probable or incurred. The Company incurred $1.6 million in lease acquisition and modification costs related to the HCP Lease Agreements. These deferred lease acquisition and modification costs are being amortized over the lease terms and are included in facility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company accounts for each of the HCP Lease Agreements as an operating lease.\nWelltower\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company leased 24 senior housing communities (collectively the Welltower Lease Agreements\u201d) from Welltower, Inc., formerly Health Care REIT, Inc. ( Welltower\u201d). The Welltower Lease Agreements each have an initial term of 15 years, with one 15-year renewal extension available at the Company's option. The initial lease rates under the Welltower Lease Agreements ranged from 7.25% to 8.5% and are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses, which will be recognized when probable or incurred. The initial terms on the Welltower Lease Agreements expire on various dates through from April 2025 through April 2026. The Company incurred $2.1 million in lease acquisition costs related to the Welltower Lease Agreements. These deferred lease acquisition costs are being amortized over the lease terms and are included in facility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company accounts for each of the Welltower Lease Agreements as an operating lease.\nThe following table summarizes each of the Company's facility lease agreements as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in millions):\n\n (1) Initial lease rates are measured against agreed upon fair market values and are subject to conditional lease escalation provisions as set forth in each respective lease agreement. \n (2) Lease acquisition and modification costs are being amortized over the respective lease terms. \n (3) Deferred gains of $34.5 million and lease concessions of $2.6 million are being recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as a reduction in facility lease expense over the respective initial lease term. Lease concessions of $0.6 million relate to the transaction with HCP on May 31, 2006, and $2.0 million relate to the transaction with Welltower on September 10, 2010. \n (4) Effective June 17, 2015, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to facilitate leasehold improvements for 10 of the leased communities, of which the underlying real estate associated with four of its operating leases was acquired by the Company upon closing the Four Property Lease Transaction on January 31, 2017, and extend the lease terms through September 30, 2025, with two five-year renewal extensions available at the Company's option. \n (5) On November 11, 2013, the Company executed an amendment to the master lease agreement associated with nine of its leased communities with HCP to facilitate leasehold improvements for one of the leased communities and extend the respective lease terms through October 31, 2020, with two 10-year renewal extensions available at the Company's option. \n (6) On April 24, 2015, the Company exercised its right to extend the lease terms with HCP through April 30, 2026, with one 10-year renewal extension remaining available at the Company's option. \nFacility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss includes rent expense plus amortization expense relating to leasehold acquisition costs offset by the amortization of deferred gains and lease incentives. There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in the Company's lease agreements. The Company was in compliance with all of its lease covenants at December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nDebt Transactions\nOn December 18, 2018, the Company repaid certain mortgage loans associated with 21 of its senior living communities totaling approximately $170.6 million from Fannie Mae which were scheduled to mature on various dates beginning August 2021 through April 2026. The repayment of these mortgage loans facilitated the establishment of a MCF with Berkadia whereby the Company obtained approximately $201.0 million of new mortgage financing. The MCF will allow the Company to make future advances, should the Company decide to do so, assuming certain borrowing conditions are satisfied. The MCF consists of two separate loans which are cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized. Approximately $150.8 million of the new financing is long-term fixed interest rate debt at a fixed interest rate of 5.13% with a 10-year term and interest only for the first 36 months and the principal amortized over a 30-year term thereafter. Approximately $50.3 million of the new financing is long-term variable interest rate debt at a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.14% with a 10-year term and interest only for the first 36 months and a fixed monthly principal component of $67,000 thereafter. The Company incurred approximately $3.0 million in deferred financing costs related to the MCF, which are being amortized over 10 years. As a result of the early repayment of the Fannie Mae mortgage debt, the Company accelerated the amortization of approximately $1.5 million in unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred prepayment premiums of approximately $11.1 million.\nOn December 18, 2018, the Company completed mortgage financing of $3.5 million from Berkadia at a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.75% on one community located in Kokomo, Indiana. The mortgage loan is interest-only and has an 18-month term maturing in July 2020.\nOn December 1, 2018, the Company renewed certain insurance policies and entered into a finance agreement totaling approximately $0.8 million. The finance agreement has a fixed interest rate of 4.40% with the principal being repaid over an 11-month term.\nOn November 30, 2018, the Company completed supplemental mortgage financing of approximately $1.8 million from Fannie Mae at a fixed interest rate of 6.30% on one community located in Mesquite, Texas. The supplemental mortgage loan is coterminous, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the original existing mortgage debt maturing in July 2024.\nEffective June 29, 2018, the Company extended its mortgage loan with Berkadia on one of its senior living communities located in Canton, Ohio. The maturity date was extended to October 10, 2021 with an initial variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 5.0% with principal amortized over 25 years.\nEffective May 31, 2018, the Company renewed certain insurance policies and entered into a finance agreement totaling approximately $1.7 million. The finance agreement has a fixed interest rate of 3.64% with the principal being repaid over an 11-month term.\nThe Company issued standby letters of credit with Wells Fargo Bank ( Wells Fargo\u201d), totaling approximately $3.4 million, for the benefit of Hartford Financial Services ( Hartford\u201d) associated with the administration of workers compensation which remain outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nThe Company issued standby letters of credit with JPMorgan Chase Bank ( Chase\u201d), totaling approximately $6.7 million, for the benefit of Welltower, on certain leases between Welltower and the Company which remain outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nThe Company issued standby letters of credit with Chase, totaling approximately $2.9 million, for the benefit of HCP on certain leases between HCP and the Company which remain outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience, observance of industry trends and various other sources of information and factors, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company believes the following are our most critical accounting policies and/or typically require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nResident revenue consists of fees for basic housing and certain support services and fees associated with additional housing and expanded support requirements such as assisted living care, memory care, and ancillary services. Basic housing and certain support services revenue is recorded when services are rendered and amounts billed are due from residents in the period in which the rental and other services are provided. Residency agreements are generally short term in nature with durations of one year or less and are typically terminable by either party, under certain circumstances, upon providing 30 days' notice, unless state law provides otherwise, with resident fees billed monthly in advance. Revenue for certain ancillary services is recognized as services are provided, and includes fees for services such as medication management, daily living activities, beautician/barber, laundry, television, guest meals, pets, and parking which are generally billed monthly in arrears.\nThe Company's senior housing communities have residency agreements which generally require the resident to pay a community fee prior to moving into the community and are recorded initially by the Company as deferred revenue. The deferred amounts are amortized over the respective residents' initial lease term which is consistent with the contractual obligation associated with the estimated stay of the resident.\nRevenues from the Medicaid program accounted for approximately 5.4% of the Company's revenue in fiscal 2018, 5.6% of the Company's revenue in fiscal 2017, and 5.5% of the Company's revenue in fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, 40, 41, and 40, respectively, of the Company's communities were providers of services under Medicaid programs. Accordingly, these communities were entitled to reimbursement under the foregoing program at established rates that were lower than private pay rates. Patient service revenue for Medicaid patients was recorded at the reimbursement rates as the rates were set prospectively by the applicable state upon the filing of an annual cost report. None of the Company's communities were providers of services under the Medicare program during fiscal 2018, 2017, or 2016.\nLaws and regulations governing the Medicaid program are complex and subject to interpretation. The Company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of potential wrongdoing. While no such regulatory inquiries have been made, compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as significant regulatory action including fines, penalties, and exclusion from the Medicaid program.\nPurchase Accounting\nIn determining the allocation of the purchase price of senior housing communities acquired to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, the Company makes estimates of fair value using information obtained as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, leasing activities and/or independent appraisals. The Company assigns the purchase price for senior living communities to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on\ntheir estimated fair values. The determination of fair value involves the use of significant judgments and estimates which is generally assessed as follows:\nThe Company allocates the fair values of buildings acquired on an as-if-vacant basis and depreciates the building values over the estimated remaining lives of the buildings, not to exceed 40 years. The Company determines the allocated values of other fixed assets, such as site improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment, based upon the replacement cost and depreciates such values over the assets' estimated remaining useful lives as determined at the acquisition date. The Company determines the value of land by considering the sales prices of similar properties in recent transactions.\nThe fair value of acquired lease-related intangibles reflects the estimated fair value of existing resident in-place leases as represented by the cost to obtain residents and an estimated absorption period to reflect the value of the rent and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period as if the property acquired was vacant. The Company amortizes any acquired resident in-place lease intangibles to depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated remaining useful life of the respective resident operating leases.\nCredit Risk and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company's resident receivables are generally due within 30 days from the date billed. Accounts receivable are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $6.8 million and $4.9 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and represent the Company's estimate of the amount that ultimately will be collected. The adequacy of the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends, write-off experience, analyses of receivable portfolios by payor source and aging of receivables, as well as a review of specific accounts, and adjustments are made to the allowance as necessary. Credit losses on resident receivables have historically been within management's estimates, and management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for expected losses.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2018.\nLease Accounting\nThe Company determines whether to account for its leases as operating, capital or financing leases depending on the underlying terms of each lease agreement. This determination of classification requires significant judgment relating to certain information, including the estimated fair value and remaining economic life of the community, the Company's cost of funds, minimum lease payments and other lease terms. The lease rates under the Company's lease agreements are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses which are recognized when probable or incurred and are based on changes in the consumer price index or certain operational performance measures. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company leased 46 communities, two of which the Company classified as capital lease and financing obligations with the remaining classified as operating leases. The Company incurs lease acquisition costs and amortizes these costs over the term of the respective lease agreement. Certain leases entered into by the Company qualified as sale/leaseback transactions, and as such, any related gains have been deferred and are being amortized over the respective lease term. No new communities were leased by the Company during fiscal 2018 or 2017. Effective January 31, 2017, the Company acquired from Ventas the underlying real estate associated with four of its operating leases. For additional information refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nFacility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive loss includes rent expense plus amortization expense relating to leasehold acquisition costs offset by the amortization of deferred gains and lease incentives.\nEmployee Health and Dental Benefits, Workers' Compensation, and Insurance Reserves\nThe Company offers full-time employees an option to participate in its health and dental plans. The Company is self-insured up to certain limits and is insured if claims in excess of these limits are incurred. The cost of employee\nhealth and dental benefits, net of employee contributions, is shared between the corporate office and the senior housing communities based on the respective number of plan participants. Funds collected are used to pay the actual program costs including estimated annual claims, third-party administrative fees, network provider fees, communication costs, and other related administrative costs incurred by the plans. Claims are paid as they are submitted to the Company's third-party administrator. The Company records a liability for outstanding claims and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. This liability is based on the historical claim reporting lag and payment trends of health insurance claims. Management believes that the liability for outstanding losses and expenses is adequate to cover the ultimate cost of losses and expenses incurred at December 31, 2018; however, actual claims and expenses may differ. Any subsequent changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\nThe Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance for workers' compensation. Determining the reserve for workers' compensation losses and costs that the Company has incurred as of the end of a reporting period involves significant judgments based on projected future events, including potential settlements for pending claims, known incidents which may result in claims, estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims, changes in insurance premiums, estimated litigation costs and other factors. The Company regularly adjusts these estimates to reflect changes in the foregoing factors. However, since this reserve is based on estimates, the actual expenses incurred may differ from the amounts reserved. Any subsequent changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\nLong-Lived Assets\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. At each balance sheet date, the Company reviews the carrying value of its property and equipment to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired or that the depreciation period may need to be changed. The Company considers internal factors such as net operating losses along with external factors relating to each asset, including contract changes, local market developments, and other publicly available information. If an indicator of impairment is identified, the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair market value, generally based on discounted cash flows, of the long-lived asset. For property and equipment where indicators of impairment were identified, tests of recoverability were performed and the Company has concluded its property and equipment is recoverable and does not warrant adjustment to the carrying value or remaining useful lives as of December 31, 2018. The Company does not believe there were any indicators of impairment that would require an adjustment to the carrying value of the property and equipment or their remaining useful lives as of December 31, 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method and current income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable. Deferred income taxes are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of loss carryforwards and temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect those carryforwards and temporary differences to be recovered or settled. Management regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance, if considered necessary, based on such evaluation. As part of the evaluation, management has evaluated taxable income in carryback years, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, feasible tax planning strategies, and future expectations of income. Based upon this evaluation, a valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce the Company's net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. However, in the event that we were to determine that it would be more likely than not that the Company would realize the benefit of deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts, adjustments to deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period we made such a determination. The benefits of the net deferred tax assets might not be realized if actual results differ from expectations. The effective tax rates for fiscal 2018 and 2017 differ from the statutory tax rates due to state income taxes, permanent tax differences, and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The Company is impacted by the Texas Margin Tax ( TMT\u201d), which effectively imposes tax on modified gross revenues for communities within the State of Texas. During each of fiscal 2018 and 2017, the Company consolidated 38 Texas communities and the TMT increased the overall provision for income taxes.\nThe Company evaluates uncertain tax positions through consideration of accounting and reporting guidance on criteria, measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition that is intended to provide better financial-statement comparability among different companies. The Company\nis required to recognize a tax benefit in its financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management's assessment is that its position is more likely than not\u201d (i.e., a greater than 50 percent likelihood) to be upheld on audit based only on the technical merits of the tax position. The Company's policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as income tax expense. The Company is generally no longer subject to federal and state income tax audits for years prior to 2015.\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-01, Business Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a Business. ASU 2017-01 provides guidance in accounting for business combinations when determining if the transaction represents acquisitions or disposals of assets or of a business. Under ASU 2017-01, when determining whether an integrated set of assets and activities constitutes a business, entities must compare the fair value of gross assets acquired to the fair value of a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in the single identifiable assets or group of similar identifiable assets, the integrated set of assets and activities is not characterized as a business. ASU 2017-01 is applied prospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-01 on January 1, 2018 and beginning from the date of adoption will apply the accounting guidance provided to the Company's acquisition activities. Management expects the adoption to require the accounting for acquisitions of senior housing communities to be reflected as acquisitions of assets rather than as a business combination; however, management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2017-01 to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). ASU 2016-18 requires an entity to include in its cash and cash-equivalent balances in the statement of cash flows those amounts that are deemed to be restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-18 on January 1, 2018 and the adoption resulted in the Company no longer reporting changes in restricted cash balances in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows within net cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities which did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 amends the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 230, which often requires judgment to determine the appropriate classification of cash flows as operating, investing or financing activities and has resulted in diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-15 on January 1, 2018 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require an incurred loss\u201d methodology for recognizing credit losses that delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. ASU 2016-13 replaces the current incurred loss methodology for credit losses and removes the thresholds that companies apply to measure credit losses on financial statements measured at amortized cost, such as loans, receivables, and held-to-maturity debt securities with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to form credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years and for interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. The new lease standard requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Additionally, in July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases, Targeted Improvements, which provided entities with a transition method option to not restate comparative periods presented, but to recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the period of adoption. The FASB retained a dual model for lease classification, requiring leases to be classified as finance or operating leases to determine recognition in the statements of operations and cash flows; however, substantially all leases will be required to be recognized on the balance sheet. The standards update will also require quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements and provides a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company expects to utilize certain practical expedients that, upon adoption, allows entities to (1) not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) retain the classification of leases (e.g., operating or finance lease) existing as of the date of adoption, (3) not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases, and (4) not record a right-of-use asset and related lease liability for leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less. The Company is in the final stages of evaluating its existing lease portfolio, including accumulating all of the necessary information required to properly account for leases under the new accounting guidance, and believes the most significant impact relates to its accounting for real estate leases. The Company plans to elect a transition option which allows for the recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption without recasting the financial statements in periods prior to adoption. At adoption, the Company expects to recognize a material increase in assets and liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet resulting from the recognition of lease liabilities initially measured at the present value of its future operating lease payments and the related right of use assets. The Company has concluded that the previously unrecognized right of use assets will be reviewed for impairment which could result in a reduction to the initially recognized right of use assets and a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of January 1, 2019. The Company continues to evaluate the impacts of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, and is updating its systems, processes, and internal controls to meet the new reporting and disclosure requirements. The adoption of this standard will have no impact on the Company's covenant compliance under its current debt and lease agreements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. Under ASU 2014-09, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018 under the modified retrospective approach. Under the modified retrospective approach, the guidance is applied to the most current period presented, recognizing the cumulative effect of the adoption to beginning retained earnings. The Company has determined that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not result in an adjustment to beginning retained earnings and did not result in significant changes to the amount and/or timing of revenue reported within the Company's consolidated financial statements; however, ASU 2014-09 requires enhanced disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue arrangements. Additionally, our contracts with residents are generally short term in nature and revenue is recognized when services are provided; as such, ASU 2014-09 provides an entity need not disclose information related to performance obligations when the performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, selected historical Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss data in thousands of dollars and expressed as a percentage of total revenues.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenues\nResident revenue was $460.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $467.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $7.0 million, or 1.5%. The decrease in resident revenue primarily results from the negative impacts of Hurricane Harvey, which resulted in the full evacuation of our residents at two of our senior housing communities located in southeast Texas during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Although these communities reopened and began accepting residents in July 2018, unoccupied units at these communities resulted in a decrease of approximately $4.6 million in our resident revenue during fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017. Additionally, we experienced a decrease in resident revenue at our other remaining senior housing communities of $2.4 million primarily due to a 1.6% decrease in average financial occupancies.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses were $452.4 million during fiscal 2018 compared to $459.2 million during fiscal 2017, representing a decrease of $6.7 million, or 1.5%. This decrease is primarily the result of a $12.9 million loss on facility lease termination incurred by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and a $3.4 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $4.0 million increase in operating expenses, a $3.4 million increase in general and administrative expenses, a $1.2 million increase in provision for bad debts, a $0.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, and a $0.1 million increase in facility lease costs.\n \u2022 The $12.9 million loss on facility lease termination is due to the Four Property Lease Transaction that closed on January 31, 2017, whereby the Company acquired the underlying real estate associated with four of the senior housing communities previously leased from Ventas. For additional information refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements. \n \u2022 The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense primarily results from a decrease in in-place lease amortization of $7.6 million from senior housing communities acquired by the Company prior to fiscal 2017, partially offset by an increase of $4.3 million from a full year of activity for senior housing communities acquired by the Company during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and due to an increase in depreciable assets from ongoing capital improvements and refurbishments at the Company's communities. \n \u2022 The increase in operating expenses primarily results from an increase of $4.3 million due to increased wages and benefits to employees for annual merit increases and incremental costs, including increased labor costs for additional staffing required for newly licensed memory care and assisted living units, to support changes in occupancy with more of our residents at higher levels of care, an increase of $1.0 million in property taxes and insurance, an increase of $0.9 million in promotion and marketing costs, an increase of $0.8 million in utilities costs, an increase of $0.7 million for information systems maintenance and support costs, and an overall increase of $0.8 million in general operating expenses primarily for repairs and maintenance, medical supplies and resident services, partially offset by an increase of $2.9 million for insurance proceeds the Company received to cover Business Interruption during fiscal 2018, for units unoccupied during the period at the two communities located in southeast Texas which were impacted by Hurricane Harvey and a $1.6 million reduction in food costs primarily due to the Company's recent procurement initiatives to streamline and automate purchasing and spend optimization. \n \u2022 The increase in general and administrative expenses primarily results from an increase of $4.2 million due to separation and placement costs primarily associated with the retirement and replacement of the Company's CEO during the fourth quarter, an increase of $2.1 million in general operating costs primarily attributable to increases in employee wages and benefits for annual merit increases and additional employees hired during or subsequent to fiscal 2017, and an increase of $0.5 million for employee benefit reserve adjustments, and an increase of $0.3 million related to ongoing renovation and conversion activities at our communities, partially offset by a net reduction of $2.1 million in employee insurance benefits and claims paid, which resulted in lower health insurance costs to the Company, and a decrease of $1.6 million due to lower amounts accrued for employee incentive compensation. \n \u2022 The increase in stock-based compensation expense results from the Company granting a larger number of shares of restricted stock to certain employees and directors of the Company during fiscal 2018, some of which required accelerated expense recognition, when compared to fiscal 2017. \nOther income and expense.\n \u2022 Interest income generally reflects interest earned on the investment of cash balances and escrowed funds or interest associated with certain income tax refunds or property tax settlements. \n \u2022 Interest expense increased $1.1 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to a full year of interest from the additional mortgage debt associated with the Four Property Lease Transaction that closed on January 31, 2017, whereby the Company acquired the underlying real estate associated with four of the senior housing communities previously leased from Ventas, and due to additional mortgage debt associated with certain supplemental loans obtained by the Company during fiscal 2018 and 2017. \n \u2022 Write-off of deferred loan costs and prepayment premiums is attributable to the early repayment of certain mortgage debt on the Company's owned properties due to the opportunity to establish a MCF with Berkadia and extend scheduled maturities. \nBenefit (Provision) for income taxes\nBenefit for income taxes for fiscal 2018 was $1.8 million, or 3.2% of loss before income taxes, compared to a provision for income taxes of $2.5 million, or 6.0% of loss before income taxes, for fiscal 2017. The effective tax rates for fiscal 2018 and 2017 differ from the statutory tax rates due to state income taxes, permanent tax differences, and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The Company is impacted by the TMT, which effectively imposes tax on modified gross revenues for communities within the State of Texas. During each of fiscal 2018 and 2017, the Company consolidated 38 Texas communities and the TMT increased the overall provision for income taxes. The variation in benefit (provision) for income taxes was attributable to slightly lower state income taxes and final remeasurement adjustments from recent tax legislation changes associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA\u201d), which was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nManagement regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance, if considered necessary, based on such evaluation. As part of the evaluation, management has evaluated taxable income in carryback years, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, feasible tax planning strategies, and future expectations of income. Based upon this evaluation, adjustments to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $9.5 million and $5.9 million were recorded during fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, to reduce the Company's net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nNet loss and comprehensive loss\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, the Company reported net loss and comprehensive loss of $(53.6 million) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and net loss and comprehensive loss of $(44.2 million) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenues\nResident revenue was $467.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $447.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $19.5 million, or 4.4%. The increase in resident revenue primarily results from an increase of $15.3 million from a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and an increase of $4.3 million due to a 2.8% increase in average monthly rental rates at the Company's same-store communities which was primarily the result of annual rent increases for our existing residents and recent capital improvements we have invested in our communities for unit conversions which enable us to provide a broader range of senior living services at higher levels of care. The increase in resident revenue at our same-store communities was negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey which resulted in the full evacuation of our residents at two of our communities located in southeast Texas. Both of these communities were undergoing repairs and remained fully vacated at December 31, 2017, which resulted in a decrease in our same-store resident revenue of approximately $3.5 million.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses were $459.2 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $433.1 million during fiscal 2016, representing an increase of $26.1 million, or 6.0%. This increase is primarily the result of a $16.8 million increase in operating expenses, a $12.9 million loss on facility lease termination, and a $5.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, slightly offset by a $5.3 million decrease in facility lease expense and a $4.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense.\n \u2022 The increase in operating expenses primarily results from an increase of $11.6 million from a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and an increase of $5.2 million at the Company's same-store communities primarily due to increased wages and benefits to employees for annual merit increases and incremental costs, including increased labor costs for additional staffing required for newly licensed memory care and assisted living units, to support changes in occupancy \n with more of our residents at higher levels of care. The increase in operating expenses at our same-store communities included a reduction of $2.2 million for insurance proceeds the Company received to cover Business Interruption through December 31, 2017, for the period the two communities located in southeast Texas were unoccupied due to Hurricane Harvey. \nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The $12.9 million loss on facility lease termination is due to the Four Property Lease Transaction that closed on January 31, 2017, whereby the Company acquired the underlying real estate associated with four of the senior housing communities previously leased from Ventas.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertain information contained in this report constitutes Forward-Looking Statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may,\u201d will,\u201d would,\u201d intend,\u201d could,\u201d believe,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d estimate\u201d or continue\u201d or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology.

The Company's operating strategy is to provide value to its senior living residents by providing quality senior living services at reasonable prices, while achieving and sustaining a strong, competitive position within its geographically concentrated regions, as well as continuing to enhance the performance of its operations. The Company provides senior living services to the elderly, including independent living, assisted living, and memory care services at reasonable prices. Many of the Company's communities offer a continuum of care to meet its residents' needs as they change over time. This continuum of care, which integrates independent living, assisted living, and memory care, and is bridged by home care through independent home care agencies, sustains residents' autonomy and independence based on their physical and mental abilities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company operated 129 senior housing communities in 23 states with an aggregate capacity of approximately 16,500 residents, including 83 senior housing communities which the Company owned and 46 senior housing communities the Company leased.\nSignificant Financial and Operational Highlights\nThe Company primarily derives its revenue by providing senior living housing and services to the elderly. When comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2017, the Company generated total revenues of approximately $460.0 million compared to total revenues of approximately $467.0 million, respectively, representing a decrease of approximately $7.0 million, or 1.5%. Our resident revenue continues to be negatively impacted from the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which resulted in the full evacuation of our residents at two of our senior housing communities located in southeast Texas during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Although physical repairs were substantially completed and both of these communities began accepting residents during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, unoccupied units at these communities resulted in a decrease of approximately $4.6 million in our resident revenue during fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017. In addition to the decrease in resident revenue from the two senior housing communities negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey, we also experienced a decrease in resident revenue at our other remaining senior housing communities of $2.4 million, which was primarily due to a 1.6% decrease in average financial occupancies.\nExcluding the two senior housing communities impacted by Hurricane Harvey, the weighted average financial occupancy rate for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was 85.2% and 86.8%, respectively. Although our occupancies declined, we achieved a 1.0% increase in average monthly rental rates when comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2017. The increase in average monthly rental rates during fiscal 2018 was primarily the result of annual rent increases for our existing residents and the capital improvements we have invested in our communities for unit conversions which enable us to provide a broader range of senior living services at higher levels of care.\nOn December 18, 2018, the Company repaid certain mortgage loans associated with 21 of its senior living communities totaling approximately $170.6 million from Fannie Mae which were scheduled to mature on various dates beginning August 2021 through April 2026. The repayment of these mortgage loans facilitated the establishment of a Master Credit Facility (the MCF\u201d) with Berkadia Commercial Mortgage ( Berkadia\u201d) whereby the Company obtained approximately $201.0 million of new mortgage financing. The MCF has a 10-year term, is interest only for the first 36 months, and will allow the Company to make future advances, should the Company decide to do so, assuming certain borrowing conditions are satisfied.\nOn December 18, 2018, the Company completed mortgage financing of $3.5 million from Berkadia at a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.75% on one community located in Kokomo, Indiana. The mortgage loan is interest-only and has an 18-month term maturing in July 2020.\nOn November 30, 2018, the Company completed supplemental mortgage financing of approximately $1.8 million from Fannie Mae at a fixed interest rate of 6.30% on one community located in Mesquite, Texas. The supplemental mortgage loan is coterminous, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the original existing mortgage debt maturing in July 2024.\nAs mentioned above, the Company had two of its senior housing communities located in southeast Texas impacted by Hurricane Harvey during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We maintain insurance coverage on these communities which includes damage caused by flooding. The insurance claim for this incident required a deductible of $100,000 that was expensed as a component of operating expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Physical repairs have been substantially completed to restore the communities to their condition prior to the incident and these communities reopened and began accepting residents in July 2018. Through December 31, 2018, we have incurred approximately $6.9 million in clean-up and physical repair costs which we believe are probable of being recovered through insurance proceeds. In addition to the repairs of physical damage to the buildings, the Company's insurance coverage includes loss of business income ( Business Interruption\u201d). Business Interruption includes reimbursement for lost revenue as well as incremental expenses incurred as a result of the hurricane. The Company received payments from our insurance underwriters during fiscal 2018 totaling approximately $9.2 million of which approximately $5.1 million related to Business Interruption, which has been included as a reduction to operating expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nFacility Leases\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company leased 46 senior housing communities from certain real estate investment trusts ( REITs\u201d). The lease terms are generally for 10-15 years with renewal options for 5-20 years at the Company's option. Under these lease agreements, the Company is responsible for all operating costs, maintenance and repairs, insurance and property taxes. No new facility leases were entered into by the Company during fiscal 2018.\nVentas\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company leased seven senior housing communities (collectively the Ventas Lease Agreements\u201d) from Ventas, Inc. ( Ventas\u201d). Effective January 31, 2017, the Company acquired from Ventas the underlying real estate associated with four of its operating leases for a total acquisition price of $85.0 million (the Four Property Lease Transaction\u201d). The Company obtained interim, interest only, bridge financing from Berkadia for $65.0 million of the acquisition price with an initial variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.0% and a 36-month term, with an option to extend 6 months, and the balance of the acquisition price paid from the Company's existing cash resources. For additional information refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to consolidated financial statements. Prior to the Four Property Lease Transaction, the Company previously leased 11 senior housing communities from Ventas.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to facilitate up to $24.5 million of leasehold improvements for 10 communities within the Ventas lease portfolio and extend the lease terms until September 30, 2025, with two five-year renewal extensions available at the Company's option. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to increase the funds budgeted for leasehold improvements (the Special Project Funds\u201d) from $24.5 million to $28.5 million and extend the date for completion of the leasehold improvements to June 30, 2017. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to decrease the Special Project Funds for leasehold improvements from $28.5 million to approximately $17.0 million due to the Four Property Lease Transaction and extend the date for completion of the leasehold improvements to June 30, 2018. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company executed amendments to the master lease agreements with Ventas to increase the Special Project Funds for leasehold improvements from approximately $17.0 million to approximately $20.0 million and extend the date for completion of the leasehold improvements to June 30, 2019. The initial lease rates under each of the Ventas Lease Agreements ranged from 6.75% to 8% and are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses which will be recognized when probable or incurred. The Company initially incurred $11.4 million in lease acquisition and modification costs related to the Ventas Lease Agreements, of which a portion of these costs were written-off upon closing the Four Property Lease Transaction leaving $8.7 million in lease acquisition and modification costs associated with the remaining properties. These deferred lease acquisition and modification costs are being amortized over the lease terms and are included in facility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company accounts for five of the Ventas Lease Agreements as an operating lease and two as a capital lease and financing obligation.\nHCP\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company leased 15 senior housing communities (collectively the HCP Lease Agreements\u201d) from HCP, Inc. ( HCP\u201d). During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company executed an amendment to the master lease agreement with HCP to facilitate up to $3.3 million of leasehold improvements for one community within the HCP lease portfolio and extend the initial lease terms for nine communities until October 31, 2020, with two 10-year renewal extensions available at the Company's option. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company exercised its right to extend the lease term with HCP for the remaining six communities in the HCP lease portfolio until April 30, 2026, with one 10-year renewal extension available at the Company's option. The initial lease rates under the HCP Lease Agreements ranged from 7.25% to 8% and are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses, which will be recognized when probable or incurred. The Company incurred $1.6 million in lease acquisition and modification costs related to the HCP Lease Agreements. These deferred lease acquisition and modification costs are being amortized over the lease terms and are included in facility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company accounts for each of the HCP Lease Agreements as an operating lease.\nWelltower\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company leased 24 senior housing communities (collectively the Welltower Lease Agreements\u201d) from Welltower, Inc., formerly Health Care REIT, Inc. ( Welltower\u201d). The Welltower Lease Agreements each have an initial term of 15 years, with one 15-year renewal extension available at the Company's option. The initial lease rates under the Welltower Lease Agreements ranged from 7.25% to 8.5% and are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses, which will be recognized when probable or incurred. The initial terms on the Welltower Lease Agreements expire on various dates through from April 2025 through April 2026. The Company incurred $2.1 million in lease acquisition costs related to the Welltower Lease Agreements. These deferred lease acquisition costs are being amortized over the lease terms and are included in facility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company accounts for each of the Welltower Lease Agreements as an operating lease.\nThe following table summarizes each of the Company's facility lease agreements as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in millions):\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td> Landlord\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Initial Date of Lease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of\nCommunities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Value

There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in the Company's lease agreements. The Company was in compliance with all of its lease covenants at December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nDebt Transactions\nOn December 18, 2018, the Company repaid certain mortgage loans associated with 21 of its senior living communities totaling approximately $170.6 million from Fannie Mae which were scheduled to mature on various dates beginning August 2021 through April 2026. The repayment of these mortgage loans facilitated the establishment of a MCF with Berkadia whereby the Company obtained approximately $201.0 million of new mortgage financing. The MCF will allow the Company to make future advances, should the Company decide to do so, assuming certain borrowing conditions are satisfied. The MCF consists of two separate loans which are cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized. Approximately $150.8 million of the new financing is long-term fixed interest rate debt at a fixed interest rate of 5.13% with a 10-year term and interest only for the first 36 months and the principal amortized over a 30-year term thereafter. Approximately $50.3 million of the new financing is long-term variable interest rate debt at a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.14% with a 10-year term and interest only for the first 36 months and a fixed monthly principal component of $67,000 thereafter. The Company incurred approximately $3.0 million in deferred financing costs related to the MCF, which are being amortized over 10 years. As a result of the early repayment of the Fannie Mae mortgage debt, the Company accelerated the amortization of approximately $1.5 million in unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred prepayment premiums of approximately $11.1 million.\nOn December 18, 2018, the Company completed mortgage financing of $3.5 million from Berkadia at a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.75% on one community located in Kokomo, Indiana. The mortgage loan is interest-only and has an 18-month term maturing in July 2020.\nOn December 1, 2018, the Company renewed certain insurance policies and entered into a finance agreement totaling approximately $0.8 million. The finance agreement has a fixed interest rate of 4.40% with the principal being repaid over an 11-month term.\nOn November 30, 2018, the Company completed supplemental mortgage financing of approximately $1.8 million from Fannie Mae at a fixed interest rate of 6.30% on one community located in Mesquite, Texas. The supplemental mortgage loan is coterminous, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the original existing mortgage debt maturing in July 2024.\nEffective June 29, 2018, the Company extended its mortgage loan with Berkadia on one of its senior living communities located in Canton, Ohio. The maturity date was extended to October 10, 2021 with an initial variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 5.0% with principal amortized over 25 years.\nEffective May 31, 2018, the Company renewed certain insurance policies and entered into a finance agreement totaling approximately $1.7 million. The finance agreement has a fixed interest rate of 3.64% with the principal being repaid over an 11-month term.\nThe Company issued standby letters of credit with Wells Fargo Bank ( Wells Fargo\u201d), totaling approximately $3.4 million, for the benefit of Hartford Financial Services ( Hartford\u201d) associated with the administration of workers compensation which remain outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nThe Company issued standby letters of credit with JPMorgan Chase Bank ( Chase\u201d), totaling approximately $6.7 million, for the benefit of Welltower, on certain leases between Welltower and the Company which remain outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nThe Company issued standby letters of credit with Chase, totaling approximately $2.9 million, for the benefit of HCP on certain leases between HCP and the Company which remain outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience, observance of industry trends and various other sources of information and factors, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company believes the following are our most critical accounting policies and/or typically require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nResident revenue consists of fees for basic housing and certain support services and fees associated with additional housing and expanded support requirements such as assisted living care, memory care, and ancillary services. Basic housing and certain support services revenue is recorded when services are rendered and amounts billed are due from residents in the period in which the rental and other services are provided. Residency agreements are generally short term in nature with durations of one year or less and are typically terminable by either party, under certain circumstances, upon providing 30 days' notice, unless state law provides otherwise, with resident fees billed monthly in advance. Revenue for certain ancillary services is recognized as services are provided, and includes fees for services such as medication management, daily living activities, beautician/barber, laundry, television, guest meals, pets, and parking which are generally billed monthly in arrears.\nThe Company's senior housing communities have residency agreements which generally require the resident to pay a community fee prior to moving into the community and are recorded initially by the Company as deferred revenue. The deferred amounts are amortized over the respective residents' initial lease term which is consistent with the contractual obligation associated with the estimated stay of the resident.\nRevenues from the Medicaid program accounted for approximately 5.4% of the Company's revenue in fiscal 2018, 5.6% of the Company's revenue in fiscal 2017, and 5.5% of the Company's revenue in fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, 40, 41, and 40, respectively, of the Company's communities were providers of services under Medicaid programs. Accordingly, these communities were entitled to reimbursement under the foregoing program at established rates that were lower than private pay rates. Patient service revenue for Medicaid patients was recorded at the reimbursement rates as the rates were set prospectively by the applicable state upon the filing of an annual cost report. None of the Company's communities were providers of services under the Medicare program during fiscal 2018, 2017, or 2016.\nLaws and regulations governing the Medicaid program are complex and subject to interpretation. The Company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of potential wrongdoing. While no such regulatory inquiries have been made, compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as significant regulatory action including fines, penalties, and exclusion from the Medicaid program.\nPurchase Accounting\nIn determining the allocation of the purchase price of senior housing communities acquired to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, the Company makes estimates of fair value using information obtained as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, leasing activities and/or independent appraisals. The Company assigns the purchase price for senior living communities to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on\ntheir estimated fair values. The determination of fair value involves the use of significant judgments and estimates which is generally assessed as follows:\nThe Company allocates the fair values of buildings acquired on an as-if-vacant basis and depreciates the building values over the estimated remaining lives of the buildings, not to exceed 40 years. The Company determines the allocated values of other fixed assets, such as site improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment, based upon the replacement cost and depreciates such values over the assets' estimated remaining useful lives as determined at the acquisition date. The Company determines the value of land by considering the sales prices of similar properties in recent transactions.\nThe fair value of acquired lease-related intangibles reflects the estimated fair value of existing resident in-place leases as represented by the cost to obtain residents and an estimated absorption period to reflect the value of the rent and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period as if the property acquired was vacant. The Company amortizes any acquired resident in-place lease intangibles to depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated remaining useful life of the respective resident operating leases.\nCredit Risk and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company's resident receivables are generally due within 30 days from the date billed. Accounts receivable are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $6.8 million and $4.9 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and represent the Company's estimate of the amount that ultimately will be collected. The adequacy of the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends, write-off experience, analyses of receivable portfolios by payor source and aging of receivables, as well as a review of specific accounts, and adjustments are made to the allowance as necessary. Credit losses on resident receivables have historically been within management's estimates, and management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for expected losses.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2018.\nLease Accounting\nThe Company determines whether to account for its leases as operating, capital or financing leases depending on the underlying terms of each lease agreement. This determination of classification requires significant judgment relating to certain information, including the estimated fair value and remaining economic life of the community, the Company's cost of funds, minimum lease payments and other lease terms. The lease rates under the Company's lease agreements are subject to certain conditional escalation clauses which are recognized when probable or incurred and are based on changes in the consumer price index or certain operational performance measures. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company leased 46 communities, two of which the Company classified as capital lease and financing obligations with the remaining classified as operating leases. The Company incurs lease acquisition costs and amortizes these costs over the term of the respective lease agreement. Certain leases entered into by the Company qualified as sale/leaseback transactions, and as such, any related gains have been deferred and are being amortized over the respective lease term. No new communities were leased by the Company during fiscal 2018 or 2017. Effective January 31, 2017, the Company acquired from Ventas the underlying real estate associated with four of its operating leases. For additional information refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nFacility lease expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive loss includes rent expense plus amortization expense relating to leasehold acquisition costs offset by the amortization of deferred gains and lease incentives.\nEmployee Health and Dental Benefits, Workers' Compensation, and Insurance Reserves\nThe Company offers full-time employees an option to participate in its health and dental plans. The Company is self-insured up to certain limits and is insured if claims in excess of these limits are incurred. The cost of employee\nhealth and dental benefits, net of employee contributions, is shared between the corporate office and the senior housing communities based on the respective number of plan participants. Funds collected are used to pay the actual program costs including estimated annual claims, third-party administrative fees, network provider fees, communication costs, and other related administrative costs incurred by the plans. Claims are paid as they are submitted to the Company's third-party administrator. The Company records a liability for outstanding claims and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. This liability is based on the historical claim reporting lag and payment trends of health insurance claims. Management believes that the liability for outstanding losses and expenses is adequate to cover the ultimate cost of losses and expenses incurred at December 31, 2018; however, actual claims and expenses may differ. Any subsequent changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\nThe Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance for workers' compensation. Determining the reserve for workers' compensation losses and costs that the Company has incurred as of the end of a reporting period involves significant judgments based on projected future events, including potential settlements for pending claims, known incidents which may result in claims, estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims, changes in insurance premiums, estimated litigation costs and other factors. The Company regularly adjusts these estimates to reflect changes in the foregoing factors. However, since this reserve is based on estimates, the actual expenses incurred may differ from the amounts reserved. Any subsequent changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\nLong-Lived Assets\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. At each balance sheet date, the Company reviews the carrying value of its property and equipment to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired or that the depreciation period may need to be changed. The Company considers internal factors such as net operating losses along with external factors relating to each asset, including contract changes, local market developments, and other publicly available information. If an indicator of impairment is identified, the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair market value, generally based on discounted cash flows, of the long-lived asset. For property and equipment where indicators of impairment were identified, tests of recoverability were performed and the Company has concluded its property and equipment is recoverable and does not warrant adjustment to the carrying value or remaining useful lives as of December 31, 2018. The Company does not believe there were any indicators of impairment that would require an adjustment to the carrying value of the property and equipment or their remaining useful lives as of December 31, 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method and current income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable. Deferred income taxes are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of loss carryforwards and temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect those carryforwards and temporary differences to be recovered or settled. Management regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance, if considered necessary, based on such evaluation. As part of the evaluation, management has evaluated taxable income in carryback years, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, feasible tax planning strategies, and future expectations of income. Based upon this evaluation, a valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce the Company's net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. However, in the event that we were to determine that it would be more likely than not that the Company would realize the benefit of deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts, adjustments to deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period we made such a determination. The benefits of the net deferred tax assets might not be realized if actual results differ from expectations. The effective tax rates for fiscal 2018 and 2017 differ from the statutory tax rates due to state income taxes, permanent tax differences, and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The Company is impacted by the Texas Margin Tax ( TMT\u201d), which effectively imposes tax on modified gross revenues for communities within the State of Texas. During each of fiscal 2018 and 2017, the Company consolidated 38 Texas communities and the TMT increased the overall provision for income taxes.\nThe Company evaluates uncertain tax positions through consideration of accounting and reporting guidance on criteria, measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition that is intended to provide better financial-statement comparability among different companies. The Company\nis required to recognize a tax benefit in its financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management's assessment is that its position is more likely than not\u201d (i.e., a greater than 50 percent likelihood) to be upheld on audit based only on the technical merits of the tax position. The Company's policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as income tax expense. The Company is generally no longer subject to federal and state income tax audits for years prior to 2015.\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-01, Business Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a Business. ASU 2017-01 provides guidance in accounting for business combinations when determining if the transaction represents acquisitions or disposals of assets or of a business. Under ASU 2017-01, when determining whether an integrated set of assets and activities constitutes a business, entities must compare the fair value of gross assets acquired to the fair value of a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in the single identifiable assets or group of similar identifiable assets, the integrated set of assets and activities is not characterized as a business. ASU 2017-01 is applied prospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-01 on January 1, 2018 and beginning from the date of adoption will apply the accounting guidance provided to the Company's acquisition activities. Management expects the adoption to require the accounting for acquisitions of senior housing communities to be reflected as acquisitions of assets rather than as a business combination; however, management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2017-01 to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). ASU 2016-18 requires an entity to include in its cash and cash-equivalent balances in the statement of cash flows those amounts that are deemed to be restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-18 on January 1, 2018 and the adoption resulted in the Company no longer reporting changes in restricted cash balances in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows within net cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities which did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 amends the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 230, which often requires judgment to determine the appropriate classification of cash flows as operating, investing or financing activities and has resulted in diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-15 on January 1, 2018 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require an incurred loss\u201d methodology for recognizing credit losses that delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. ASU 2016-13 replaces the current incurred loss methodology for credit losses and removes the thresholds that companies apply to measure credit losses on financial statements measured at amortized cost, such as loans, receivables, and held-to-maturity debt securities with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to form credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years and for interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. The new lease standard requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Additionally, in July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases, Targeted Improvements, which provided entities with a transition method option to not restate comparative periods presented, but to recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the period of adoption. The FASB retained a dual model for lease classification, requiring leases to be classified as finance or operating leases to determine recognition in the statements of operations and cash flows; however, substantially all leases will be required to be recognized on the balance sheet. The standards update will also require quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements and provides a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company expects to utilize certain practical expedients that, upon adoption, allows entities to (1) not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) retain the classification of leases (e.g., operating or finance lease) existing as of the date of adoption, (3) not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases, and (4) not record a right-of-use asset and related lease liability for leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less. The Company is in the final stages of evaluating its existing lease portfolio, including accumulating all of the necessary information required to properly account for leases under the new accounting guidance, and believes the most significant impact relates to its accounting for real estate leases. The Company plans to elect a transition option which allows for the recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption without recasting the financial statements in periods prior to adoption. At adoption, the Company expects to recognize a material increase in assets and liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet resulting from the recognition of lease liabilities initially measured at the present value of its future operating lease payments and the related right of use assets. The Company has concluded that the previously unrecognized right of use assets will be reviewed for impairment which could result in a reduction to the initially recognized right of use assets and a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of January 1, 2019. The Company continues to evaluate the impacts of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, and is updating its systems, processes, and internal controls to meet the new reporting and disclosure requirements. The adoption of this standard will have no impact on the Company's covenant compliance under its current debt and lease agreements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. Under ASU 2014-09, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018 under the modified retrospective approach. Under the modified retrospective approach, the guidance is applied to the most current period presented, recognizing the cumulative effect of the adoption to beginning retained earnings. The Company has determined that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not result in an adjustment to beginning retained earnings and did not result in significant changes to the amount and/or timing of revenue reported within the Company's consolidated financial statements; however, ASU 2014-09 requires enhanced disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue arrangements. Additionally, our contracts with residents are generally short term in nature and revenue is recognized when services are provided; as such, ASU 2014-09 provides an entity need not disclose information related to performance obligations when the performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less.\nResults of Operations\nThe following

2017\nRevenues\nResident revenue was $460.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $467.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $7.0 million, or 1.5%. The decrease in resident revenue primarily results from the negative impacts of Hurricane Harvey, which resulted in the full evacuation of our residents at two of our senior housing communities located in southeast Texas during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Although these communities reopened and began accepting residents in July 2018, unoccupied units at these communities resulted in a decrease of approximately $4.6 million in our resident revenue during fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017. Additionally, we experienced a decrease in resident revenue at our other remaining senior housing communities of $2.4 million primarily due to a 1.6% decrease in average financial occupancies.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses were $452.4 million during fiscal 2018 compared to $459.2 million during fiscal 2017, representing a decrease of $6.7 million, or 1.5%. This decrease is primarily the result of a $12.9 million loss on facility lease termination incurred by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and a $3.4 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $4.0 million increase in operating expenses, a $3.4 million increase in general and administrative expenses, a $1.2 million increase in provision for bad debts, a $0.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, and a $0.1 million increase in facility lease costs.\n \u2022 The $12.9 million loss on facility lease termination is due to the Four Property Lease Transaction that closed on January 31, 2017, whereby the Company acquired the underlying real estate associated with four of the senior housing communities previously leased from Ventas. For additional information refer to Note 3, Acquisitions\u201d, within the notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements. \n \u2022 The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense primarily results from a decrease in in-place lease amortization of $7.6 million from senior housing communities acquired by the Company prior to fiscal 2017, partially offset by an increase of $4.3 million from a full year of activity for senior housing communities acquired by the Company during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and due to an increase in depreciable assets from ongoing capital improvements and refurbishments at the Company's communities. \n \u2022 The increase in operating expenses primarily results from an increase of $4.3 million due to increased wages and benefits to employees for annual merit increases and incremental costs, including increased labor costs for additional staffing required for newly licensed memory care and assisted living units, to support changes in occupancy with more of our residents at higher levels of care, an increase of $1.0 million in property taxes and insurance, an increase of $0.9 million in promotion and marketing costs, an increase of $0.8 million in utilities costs, an increase of $0.7 million for information systems maintenance and support costs, and an overall increase of $0.8 million in general operating expenses primarily for repairs and maintenance, medical supplies and resident services, partially offset by an increase of $2.9 million for insurance proceeds the Company received to cover Business Interruption during fiscal 2018, for units unoccupied during the period at the two communities located in southeast Texas which were impacted by Hurricane Harvey and a $1.6 million reduction in food costs primarily due to the Company's recent procurement initiatives to streamline and automate purchasing and spend optimization. \n \u2022 The increase in general and administrative expenses primarily results from an increase of $4.2 million due to separation and placement costs primarily associated with the retirement and replacement of the Company's CEO during the fourth quarter, an increase of $2.1 million in general operating costs primarily attributable to increases in employee wages and benefits for annual merit increases and additional employees hired during or subsequent to fiscal 2017, and an increase of $0.5 million for employee benefit reserve adjustments, and an increase of $0.3 million related to ongoing renovation and conversion activities at our communities, partially offset by a net reduction of $2.1 million in employee insurance benefits and claims paid, which resulted in lower health insurance costs to the Company, and a decrease of $1.6 million due to lower amounts accrued for employee incentive compensation. \n \u2022 The increase in stock-based compensation expense results from the Company granting a larger number of shares of restricted stock to certain employees and directors of the Company during fiscal 2018, some of which required accelerated expense recognition, when compared to fiscal 2017. \nOther income and expense.\n \u2022 Interest income generally reflects interest earned on the investment of cash balances and escrowed funds or interest associated with certain income tax refunds or property tax settlements. \n \u2022 Interest expense increased $1.1 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to a full year of interest from the additional mortgage debt associated with the Four Property Lease Transaction that closed on January 31, 2017, whereby the Company acquired the underlying real estate associated with four of the senior housing communities previously leased from Ventas, and due to additional mortgage debt associated with certain supplemental loans obtained by the Company during fiscal 2018 and 2017. \n \u2022 Write-off of deferred loan costs and prepayment premiums is attributable to the early repayment of certain mortgage debt on the Company's owned properties due to the opportunity to establish a MCF with Berkadia and extend scheduled maturities. \nBenefit (Provision) for income taxes\nBenefit for income taxes for fiscal 2018 was $1.8 million, or 3.2% of loss before income taxes, compared to a provision for income taxes of $2.5 million, or 6.0% of loss before income taxes, for fiscal 2017. The effective tax rates for fiscal 2018 and 2017 differ from the statutory tax rates due to state income taxes, permanent tax differences, and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The Company is impacted by the TMT, which effectively imposes tax on modified gross revenues for communities within the State of Texas. During each of fiscal 2018 and 2017, the Company consolidated 38 Texas communities and the TMT increased the overall provision for income taxes. The variation in benefit (provision) for income taxes was attributable to slightly lower state income taxes and final remeasurement adjustments from recent tax legislation changes associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA\u201d), which was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nManagement regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance, if considered necessary, based on such evaluation. As part of the evaluation, management has evaluated taxable income in carryback years, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, feasible tax planning strategies, and future expectations of income. Based upon this evaluation, adjustments to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $9.5 million and $5.9 million were recorded during fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, to reduce the Company's net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nNet loss and comprehensive loss\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, the Company reported net loss and comprehensive loss of $(53.6 million) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and net loss and comprehensive loss of $(44.2 million) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenues\nResident revenue was $467.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $447.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $19.5 million, or 4.4%. The increase in resident revenue primarily results from an increase of $15.3 million from a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and an increase of $4.3 million due to a 2.8% increase in average monthly rental rates at the Company's same-store communities which was primarily the result of annual rent increases for our existing residents and recent capital improvements we have invested in our communities for unit conversions which enable us to provide a broader range of senior living services at higher levels of care. The increase in resident revenue at our same-store communities was negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey which resulted in the full evacuation of our residents at two of our communities located in southeast Texas. Both of these communities were undergoing repairs and remained fully vacated at December 31, 2017, which resulted in a decrease in our same-store resident revenue of approximately $3.5 million.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses were $459.2 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $433.1 million during fiscal 2016, representing an increase of $26.1 million, or 6.0%. This increase is primarily the result of a $16.8 million increase in operating expenses, a $12.9 million loss on facility lease termination, and a $5.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, slightly offset by a $5.3 million decrease in facility lease expense and a $4.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense.\n \u2022 The increase in operating expenses primarily results from an increase of $11.6 million from a full year of activity for the senior housing communities acquired by the Company during fiscal 2016 and an increase of $5.2 million at the Company's same-store communities primarily due to increased wages and benefits to employees for annual merit increases and incremental costs, including increased labor costs for additional staffing required for newly licensed memory care and assisted living units, to support changes in occupancy \n with more of our residents at higher levels of care. The increase in operating expenses at our same-store communities included a reduction of $2.2 million for insurance proceeds the Company received to cover Business Interruption through December 31, 2017, for the period the two communities located in southeast Texas were unoccupied due to Hurricane Harvey. \nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The $12.9 million loss on facility lease termination is due to the Four Property Lease Transaction that closed on January 31, 2017, whereby the Company acquired the underlying real estate associated with four of the senior housing communities previously leased from Ventas."}
