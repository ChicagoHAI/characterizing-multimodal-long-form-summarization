Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nExecutive Summary\nThe following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, including a brief discussion of our business and products, key factors that impacted our performance and a summary of our operating results. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future periods.\nOverview\nCree, Inc. (Cree, we, our, or us) is a leading innovator of lighting-class light emitting diode (LED) products, lighting products and wide bandgap semiconductor products for power and radio-frequency (RF) applications. Our products are targeted for applications such as indoor and outdoor lighting, video displays, transportation, electronic signs and signals, power supplies, inverters and wireless systems. As discussed more fully below, we operate in three reportable segments: Lighting Products, LED Products and Wolfspeed.\nOur lighting products primarily consist of LED lighting systems and lamps. We design, manufacture and sell lighting fixtures and lamps for the commercial, industrial and consumer markets.\nOur LED products consist of LED chips and LED components. Our LED products enable our customers to develop and market LED-based products for lighting, video screens, automotive and other industrial applications.\nOur Wolfspeed business consists of silicon carbide (SiC) materials, power devices and RF devices based on wide bandgap semiconductor materials such as SiC and gallium nitride (GaN). Our materials products and power devices are used in solar, electric vehicles, motor drives, power supplies and transportation applications. Our RF devices are used in military communications, radar, satellite and telecommunication applications.\nAs discussed more fully in Note 1, Business,\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, on July 13, 2016, we executed a definitive agreement to sell the Wolfspeed business to Infineon Technologies AG (Infineon). Beginning in July 2016, the Company classified the results of the Wolfspeed business as discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated statements of loss for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets. On March 6, 2017, the definitive agreement with Infineon was terminated. As a result of the termination of the agreement, we have reclassified the results of the Wolfspeed business as continuing operations in our consolidated statements of loss, and presented it as a separate reportable segment, for all periods presented. Additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations were reclassified as held and used in the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented.\nThe majority of our products are manufactured at our production facilities located in North Carolina, Wisconsin and China. We also use contract manufacturers for certain products and aspects of product fabrication, assembly and packaging. We operate research and development facilities in North Carolina, Arkansas, California, Wisconsin, India, Italy and China (including Hong Kong).\nCree, Inc. is a North Carolina corporation established in 1987, and our headquarters are in Durham, North Carolina. For further information about our consolidated revenue and earnings, please see our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nReportable Segments\nOur three reportable segments are:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Lighting Products\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>LED Products\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Wolfspeed\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Reportable segments are components of an entity that have separate financial data that the entity's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) regularly reviews when allocating resources and assessing performance. Our CODM is the Chief Executive Officer.\nOur CODM does not review inter-segment transactions when evaluating segment performance and allocating resources to each segment, and inter-segment transactions are not included in our segment revenue disclosure. As such, total segment revenue is equal to our consolidated revenue.\nOur CODM reviews gross profit as the lowest and only level of segment profit. As such, all items below gross profit in the Consolidated Statements of Loss must be included to reconcile the consolidated gross profit to our consolidated loss before income taxes.\nFor financial results by reportable segment, please refer to Note 14, Reportable Segments,\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nIndustry Dynamics and Trends\nThere are a number of industry factors that affect our business which include, among others:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Overall Demand for Products and Applications using LEDs, SiC power devices and GaN RF devices. Our potential for growth depends significantly on the continued adoption of LEDs, the adoption of SiC and GaN substrate and device products in the power and RF markets, and our ability to win new designs for these applications. Demand also fluctuates based on various market cycles, continuously evolving industry supply chains, and evolving competitive dynamics in each of the respective markets. These uncertainties make demand difficult to forecast for us and our customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Intense and Constantly Evolving Competitive Environment. Competition in the industries we serve is intense. Many companies have made significant investments in product development and production equipment. Product pricing pressures exist as market participants often undertake pricing strategies to gain or protect market share, increase the utilization of their production capacity and open new applications to the LED, lighting, power and RF markets we serve. To remain competitive, market participants must continuously increase product performance, reduce costs and develop improved ways to serve their customers. To address these competitive pressures, we invest in research and development activities to support new product development, lower product costs and deliver higher levels of performance to differentiate our products in the market. In addition, we invest in systems, people and new processes to improve our ability to deliver a better overall experience for our customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Lighting Sales Channel Development. Commercial lighting is usually sold through lighting agents and distributors in the North American lighting market. The lighting agents typically have exclusive sales rights for a defined territory and are typically aligned with one large lighting company for a large percentage of their product sales. The size, quality and capability of the lighting agent has a significant effect on winning new projects and sales in a given geographic market. While these agents sell other lighting products, the large traditional lighting companies have taken steps to prevent their channel partners from selling competing product lines. We are constantly working to improve the capabilities of our existing channel partners and increase our share of their sales as well as develop new partners to improve our sales effectiveness in each geographic market.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Technological Innovation and Advancement. Innovations and advancements in LEDs, lighting and power and RF technologies continue to expand the potential commercial application for our products. However, new technologies or standards could emerge or improvements could be made in existing technologies that could reduce or limit the demand for our products in certain markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Intellectual Property Issues. Market participants rely on patented and non-patented proprietary information relating to product development, manufacturing capabilities and other core competencies of their business. Protection of intellectual property is critical. Therefore, steps such as additional patent applications, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, as well as other security measures are generally taken. To enforce or protect intellectual property rights, litigation or threatened litigation is common.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Fiscal 2017 Overview\nThe following is a summary of our financial results for the year ended June 25, 2017:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our year-over-year revenue decreased by $144 million to $1.5 billion.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Gross margin remained flat at 30%.

These businesses are in different phases of their growth plans and generally operate on different market cycles. This is targeted to provide better business diversity and less cyclical results over time.\nWe are focused on the following priorities to support our goals of delivering higher revenue and profits over time:\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Invest in the Wolfspeed business to increase capacity and further develop the technology to support longer term

approved a plan to restructure the LED Products business. The restructuring reduced excess capacity and overhead in order to improve the cost structure moving forward. The primary components of the restructuring include the planned sale or abandonment of certain manufacturing equipment, facility consolidation and the elimination of certain positions. The restructuring activity ended in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, we realized $18.8 million in LED restructuring charges, which were partially offset by a $1.1 million gain on the sale of long-lived assets related to the restructuring which were sold for a value in excess of their estimated net realizable value during fiscal 2016.\nThe following table summarizes the actual charges incurred (in thousands): Table 120: <table><tr><td> </td>

Lighting Products revenue decreased by 21% and LED Products revenue decreased slightly, while Wolfspeed revenue increased by 25%. For the fiscal year ended 2016, our consolidated revenue remained flat at $1.6 billion compared to fiscal 2015. Lighting Products revenue and LED Products revenue decreased by 2% and 1%, respectively, while Wolfspeed revenue increased by 3%.\nLighting Products Segment Revenue\nLighting Products revenue represented approximately 48%, 55%, and 56% of our total revenue for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. Lighting Products revenue was $701.5 million, $889.1 million, and $906.5 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively.\nLighting Products revenue decreased 21% to $701.5 million in fiscal 2017 from $889.1 million in fiscal 2016. This decrease was the result of a 15% decrease in units sold and an 11% decrease in average selling prices (ASP), partially offset by the incremental revenue associated with a patent license issuance fee in connection with a new patent license agreement. The decrease in units sold in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to lower sales in both our commercial and consumer channels. The decrease in ASP in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower consumer bulb prices year over year.\nLighting Products revenue decreased 2% to $889.1 million in fiscal 2016 from $906.5 million in fiscal 2015. This decrease was the result of lower consumer lighting sales which offset higher commercial lighting sales. The number of units sold decreased 22% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 due to lower consumer bulb sales and a change in mix, which was partially offset by an increase in ASP. The ASP increased 26% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a higher mix of commercial lighting fixtures, which have a higher ASP than our other lighting products.\nLED Products Segment Revenue\nLED Products revenue represented 37%, 34%, and 34% of our total revenue for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. LED Products revenue was $550.3 million, $551.2 million, and $555.0 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nLED Products revenue decreased slightly to $550.3 million in fiscal 2017 from $551.2 million in fiscal 2016. This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in licensing revenue mostly offset by increased product sales. The number of units sold increased 7% which was partially offset by 5% decrease in ASPs. The decrease in ASP in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to competitive pricing pressures.\nLED Products revenue decreased 1% to $551.2 million in fiscal 2016 from $555.0 million in fiscal 2015. This decrease was primarily a result of a reduction in ASP due to increased global competition for LED products which impacted both our LED chip and LED component product lines, partially offset by an increase in the overall number of units sold and an increase in license revenue associated with new patent license agreements. The ASP decreased 11% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and the overall number of units sold increased 12% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nWolfspeed Segment Revenue\nWolfspeed revenue represented approximately 15%, 11%, and 10% of our total revenue for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Wolfspeed revenue was $221.2 million, $176.3 million, and $171.0 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWolfspeed revenue increased 25% to $221.2 million in fiscal 2017 from $176.3 million in fiscal 2016. This increase was primarily the result of a 29% increase in the number of units sold and a 2% increase in ASP, which were partially offset by a decrease in contract revenue. The increase in units sold in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was the result of increases across all products. The increase in ASP in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a greater mix of higher priced material substrate and RF device products.\nWolfspeed revenue increased 3% to $176.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $171.0 million in fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily the result of higher substrate and contract revenue, partially offset by lower device sales. ASPs increased 17% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, partially offset by a 17% decrease in the number of units sold. The increase in ASP was due to a higher substrate sale mix and a greater mix of higher priced power and RF products. The decrease in units sold was primarily the result of lower RF units sold.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit and gross margin were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-Over-Year Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>June 25, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 26, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 28, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lighting Products gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$196,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$238,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$235,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($42,024\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lighting Products gross margin\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LED Products\n</td> <td>151,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22,139\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LED Products Gross Margin\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wolfspeed gross profit\n</td> <td>103,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,099\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wolfspeed gross margin\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated costs\n</td> <td>(16,786\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,604\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,299\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$434,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$487,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$473,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($52,502\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$13,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated gross margin\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur consolidated gross profit decreased 11% to $434.6 million in fiscal 2017 from $487.1 million in fiscal 2016.

Our consolidated gross margin increased to 30% in fiscal 2016 from 29% in fiscal 2015.\nLighting Products Segment Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nLighting Products gross profit was $196.2 million, $238.2 million, and $235.5 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Lighting Products gross margin was 28%, 27%, and 26% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nLighting Products gross profit decreased 18% to $196.2 million in fiscal 2017 from $238.2 million in fiscal 2016. Lighting Products gross margin increased to 28% in fiscal 2017 from 27% in fiscal 2016. Lighting Products gross profit decreased primarily due to lower lighting product sales, higher commercial lighting product warranty reserves, and lower factory utilization, which were partially offset by a patent license issuance fee. Lighting Products gross margin increased due to the patent license issuance fee revenue, partially offset by the higher commercial lighting product warranty reserves and lower factory utilization from lower lighting product sales.\nLighting Products gross profit increased 1% to $238.2 million in fiscal 2016 from $235.5 million in fiscal 2015. Lighting Products gross margin increased to 27% in fiscal 2016 from 26% in fiscal 2015. Lighting Products gross profit and gross margin increased due to a more favorable mix of commercial lighting fixtures and the benefit of factory cost reductions.\nLED Products Segment Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nOur LED Products gross profit was $151.7 million, $173.8 million, and $159.0 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

LED Products gross profit and gross margin increased due to higher license revenue and higher units sold, partially offset by lower pricing. In fiscal 2015, LED Products gross profit and gross margin were negatively impacted by increases in channel inventory reserves and inventory reserves pursuant to our restructuring plan, as well as lower factory utilization resulting from lower demand and our targeted actions in the latter half of fiscal 2015 to reduce inventory balances for our LED Products segment.\nWolfspeed Segment Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nWolfspeed gross profit was $103.5 million, $94.6 million, and $99.7 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Wolfspeed gross margin was 47%, 54%, and 58% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWolfspeed gross profit increased 9% to $103.5 million in fiscal 2017 from $94.6 million in fiscal 2016. Wolfspeed gross margin decreased to 47% in fiscal 2017 from 54% in fiscal 2016. Wolfspeed gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Wolfspeed gross margin decreased primarily due to costs associated with new product ramp ups and changes in product mix.\nWolfspeed gross profit decreased 5% to $94.6 million in fiscal 2016 from $99.7 million in fiscal 2015. Wolfspeed gross margin decreased to 54% in fiscal 2016 from 58% in fiscal 2015. Wolfspeed gross profit and gross margin decreased primarily due to costs associated with new product ramp ups and changes in product mix.\nUnallocated Costs\nUnallocated costs were $16.8 million, $19.6 million, and $20.3 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These costs consisted primarily of manufacturing employees' stock-based compensation, expenses for profit sharing and quarterly or annual incentive plans and matching contributions under our 401(k) plan. These costs were not allocated to the reportable segments' gross profit because our CODM does not review them regularly when evaluating segment performance and allocating resources.\nUnallocated costs decreased by $2.8 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower stock-based compensation incurred as a result of our lower average share price.\nUnallocated costs decreased by $0.7 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to lower stock-based compensation incurred as a result of our lower average share price.\nFor further information on the allocation of costs to segment gross profit, refer to Note 14, Reportable Segments,\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products, enhancements of existing products and general technology research. These costs consisted primarily of employee salaries and related compensation costs, occupancy costs, consulting costs and the cost of development equipment and supplies.\nThe following sets forth our research and development expenses in dollars and as a percentage of revenue (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-Over-Year Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>June 25, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 26, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 28, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$158,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$168,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$182,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($10,299\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($13,949\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of revenue\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses decreased in fiscal 2017 to $158.5 million compared to $168.8 million in fiscal 2016, which decreased from $182.8 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to cost management and the nature of current research and development projects. The decrease in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a shift in emphasis to lighting-related research and development, which is inherently less expensive than LED research and development.\nOur research and development expenses vary significantly from year to year based on a number of factors, including the timing of new product introductions and the number and nature of our ongoing research and development activities.\nSales, General and Administrative\nSales, general and administrative expenses were comprised primarily of costs associated with our sales and marketing personnel and our executive and administrative personnel (for example, finance, human resources, information technology and legal) and consisted of salaries and related compensation costs; consulting and other professional services (such as litigation and other outside legal counsel fees, audit and other compliance costs); marketing and advertising expenses; facilities and insurance costs; and travel and other costs.

Our short-term investments consisted primarily of municipal bonds, corporate bonds, U.S. agency securities, non-U.S. certificates of deposit and non-U.S. government securities. The primary objective of our investment policy is preservation of principal. Other long-term investments consisted of our approximately 15% common stock ownership interest in Lextar Electronics Corporation (Lextar), which was completed in December 2014. This investment was accounted for under the equity method from the date of investment until June 2016 when we chose for our representative not to stand for re-election as a member of the Lextar board of directors. We utilize the fair value option in accounting for our investment in Lextar.\nGain on sale of investments, net. Gain on sale of investments, net was $93 thousand, $238 thousand and $925 thousand in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. Gain on sale of investments, net decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower sales of investments. Gain on sale of investments, net decreased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower sales of investments.\nGain (loss) on equity investment. Gain on equity investment was $7.5 million in fiscal 2017 and loss on equity investment was $15.4 million and $22.6 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. We had a gain on equity investment in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in the fair value of our Lextar investment. We had a loss on equity investment in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 due to decreases in the fair value of our Lextar investment. Lextar's stock is publicly traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange and its share price increased from 15.70 New Taiwanese Dollars (TWD) at June 26, 2016 to 18.40 TWD at June 25, 2017. Lextar's share price declined from 30 TWD at the date of our investment in December 2014 to 21.55 TWD at June 28, 2015 and to 15.70 TWD at June 26, 2016. This volatile stock price trend may continue in the future given the risks inherent in Lextar's business and trends affecting the Taiwan and global equity markets. Any future stock price changes will be recorded as further gains or losses on equity investment based on the increase or decrease, respectively, in the fair value of the investment during the applicable fiscal period. Further losses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nDividends from equity investment. Dividends from equity investment were $0.0 million, $1.7 million and $2.6 million in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively, due to our Lextar investment.\nInterest income, net. Interest income, net was $3.7 million, $4.5 million and $9.1 million in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. The decrease in interest income, net in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower invested balances and higher interest expense due to overall higher borrowings associated with our line of credit, partially offset by higher investment yields. The decrease in interest income, net in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower invested balances and higher interest expense due to overall higher borrowings associated with our line of credit, partially offset by higher investment yields.\nForeign currency gain (loss), net. Foreign currency gain (loss), net consisted primarily of remeasurement adjustments resulting from our Lextar investment and consolidating our international subsidiaries. The foreign currency gain, net in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to favorable fluctuations in the exchange rate between both the Chinese Yuan and the Euro and the United States Dollar which was partially offset by an unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the TWD and the United States Dollar related to our Lextar investment. The foreign currency loss, net in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the TWD and the United States Dollar related to our Lextar investment and unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the Chinese Yuan and the United States Dollar. The foreign currency gain, net for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the TWD and the United States Dollar related to our Lextar investment and unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the Euro and the United States Dollar.\nOther, net. Other, net was $200 thousand, $457 thousand and $572 thousand in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nThe following table sets forth our income tax expense (benefit) in dollars and our effective tax rate (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-Over-Year Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>June 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$93,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($1,970\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($19,247\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,844\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>(2,004\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognized income tax expense of $93.5 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to income tax benefit of $2.0 million in fiscal 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 8% in fiscal 2016 to (2,004)% in fiscal 2017 was due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets and other deferred charges in a period of a pre-tax loss, as discussed more fully in Note 12 Income Taxes\u201d to our audited financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 23% in fiscal 2015 to 8% in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on foreign net operating loss carryovers during fiscal 2016.\nThe variation between our effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent is due to: (i) changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Luxembourg, (ii) income derived from international locations with lower tax rates than the U.S., and (iii) tax credits generated.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including outlays for research and development, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, marketable securities, cash generated from operations and availability under our line of credit. Our ability to generate cash from operations has been one of our fundamental strengths and has provided us with substantial flexibility in meeting our operating, financing and investing needs. We have a $500 million line of credit as discussed in Note 8, Long-term Debt,\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. The purpose of this facility is to provide short term flexibility to optimize returns on our cash and investment portfolio while funding share repurchases, capital expenditures and other general business needs.\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our current working capital, availability under our line of credit and anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. We may use a portion of our available cash and cash equivalents, line of credit or funds underlying our marketable securities to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors. With our strong working capital position, we believe that we have the ability to continue to invest in further development of our products and, when necessary or appropriate, make selective acquisitions or other strategic investments to strengthen our product portfolio, secure key intellectual properties or expand our production capacity.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, spin-offs or investments in complementary businesses, and we anticipate continuing to make such evaluations. We may also access capital markets through the issuance of debt or additional shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of complementary businesses or other significant assets or for other strategic opportunities.\nContractual Obligations\nAt June 25, 2017, payments to be made pursuant to significant contractual obligations are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One to\nThree Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three to\nFive Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\nFive Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$14,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$4,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$6,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>124,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>145,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on long-term debt1\n</td> <td>11,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities2\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$295,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$119,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$161,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$8,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1Interest payments on long-term debt are based on the interest rate at June 25, 2017.\n2 Other long-term liabilities as of June 25, 2017 included long-term tax contingencies and other tax liabilities of $49.9 million, deferred liabilities of $0.4 million and other long-term contingent liabilities (for example, warranties) of $19.8 million. These liabilities were not included in the table above as they will either not be settled in cash and/or the timing of any payments is uncertain.\nOperating lease obligations include rental amounts due on leases of certain office and manufacturing space under the terms of non-cancelable operating leases. These leases expire at various times through April 2024. Most of the lease agreements provide for rental adjustments for increases in base rent, property taxes and general property maintenance that would be recognized as rent expense, if applicable.\nPurchase obligations represent purchase commitments, including open purchase orders and contracts, and are generally related to the purchase of goods and services in the ordinary course of business such as raw materials, supplies and capital equipment.\nFinancial Condition\nThe following table sets forth our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (in thousands):\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>June 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$132,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$166,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($33,557\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments\n</td> <td>478,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$610,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$605,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur liquidity and capital resources primarily depend on our cash flows from operations and our working capital.

All of our investments had investment grade ratings, and any such investments that were in an unrealized loss position at June 25, 2017 were in such position due to interest rate changes, sector credit rating changes or company-specific rating changes. As we intend and believe that we have the ability to hold such investments for a period of time that will be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value, we currently expect to receive the full principal or recover our cost basis in these securities. The declines in value of the securities in our portfolio are considered to be temporary in nature and, accordingly, we do not believe these securities are impaired as of June 25, 2017.\nCash Flows\nIn summary, our cash flows were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-Over-Year Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>June 25, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 26, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 28, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$215,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$203,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$181,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$12,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$22,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(145,250\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,903\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,137\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(137,347\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(104,078\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(167,859\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(311,353\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign exchange changes\n</td> <td>(129\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,110\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(878\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(232\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($33,557\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$26,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($147,114\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($60,001\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$173,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following is a discussion of our primary sources and uses of cash in our operating, investing and financing activities.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased to $215.9 million in fiscal 2017 from $203.3 million in fiscal 2016, primarily due to cash generated from working capital, partially offset by a higher net loss in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $203.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $181.3 million in fiscal 2015, primarily due to a lower net loss in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur investing activities primarily relate to transactions within our short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment and payments for patents and licensing rights. Net cash used in investing activities was $145.3 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $7.9 million in fiscal 2016. Purchases of property, equipment and patent rights decreased by $35.1 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Net purchases of short-term investments increased $181.1 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. This year over year increase was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the sale and maturities of short-term investments, partially offset by a decrease in short-term investment purchase activity. Fiscal 2016 included $12.5 million in net expenditures to acquire APEI.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $7.9 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $16.1 million in fiscal 2015. Purchases of property, equipment and patent rights decreased by $91.2 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Net proceeds from the sale of short-term investments decreased $156 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. This year over year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the sale and maturities of short-term investments, partially offset by a decrease in short-term investment purchase activity. Fiscal 2016 included $12.5 million in net expenditures to acquire APEI while fiscal 2015 included the $80.6 million investment in Lextar.\nFor fiscal 2018, we target approximately $220 million of capital investment, which is primarily related to infrastructure projects to support our longer term growth and strategic priorities.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $104.1 million in fiscal 2017 compared to net cash used by financing activities of $167.9 million in fiscal 2016. Our financing activities for fiscal 2017 primarily consisted of repurchases of common stock of $104.0 million and net payments on long-term debt borrowings of $15.0 million on our line of credit, partially offset by proceeds of $17.7 million from net issuances of common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, including the excess tax benefit on those exercises. Fiscal 2017 included payment of $2.8 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration related to our fiscal 2016 acquisition of APEI.\nIn fiscal 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $167.9 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $311.4 million in fiscal 2015. Our financing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily consisted of repurchases of common stock of $149.6 million and net payments on long-term borrowings of $40.0 million on our line of credit, partially offset by proceeds of $21.7 million from net issuances of common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, including the excess tax benefit on those exercises.\nOn August 24, 2016, the Board of Directors approved our fiscal 2017 stock repurchase program, authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock having an aggregate purchase price not exceeding $300 million for all purchases from August 24, 2016 through the expiration of the program on June 25, 2017.\nOn June 14, 2017, the Board of Directors approved our fiscal 2018 stock repurchase program, authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock having an aggregate purchase price not exceeding $200 million for all purchases from June 26, 2017 through the expiration of the program on June 24, 2018. Since the inception of our stock repurchase program in 2001, we have repurchased 38.7 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $28.66 per share with an aggregate value of $1.1 billion. The repurchase program may be implemented through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of our management.\nFair Value\nUnder U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches, including quoted market prices and discounted cash flows. U.S. GAAP also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that we are able to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for instruments that are similar, or quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar instruments, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The financial assets for which we perform recurring fair value remeasurements are cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of June 25, 2017, financial assets utilizing Level 1 inputs included money market funds. Financial assets utilizing Level 2 inputs included municipal bonds, corporate bonds, non-U.S. certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and common stock of non-U.S. corporations. Level 2 assets are valued using a third-party pricing service's consensus price which is a weighted average price based on multiple sources. These sources determine prices utilizing market income models which factor in, where applicable, transactions of similar assets in active markets, transactions of identical assets in infrequent markets, interest rates, bond or credit default swap spreads and volatility. We do not have any financial assets requiring the use of Level 3 inputs. Please refer to Note 6, Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information.\nFinancial and Market Risks\nWe are exposed to financial and market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodities risk. We have entered and may in the future enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments in an effort to manage or hedge some of our foreign exchange rate risk. We may not be able to engage in hedging transactions in the future, and even if we do, foreign currency fluctuations may still have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial performance. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial positions at June 25, 2017 and June 26, 2016. Actual results may differ materially.\nInterest Rates\nWe maintain an investment portfolio principally composed of money market funds, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. In order to minimize risk, our cash management policy permits us to acquire investments rated A\u201d grade or better. As of June 25, 2017 and June 26, 2016, our cash equivalents and short-term investments had a fair value of $482.1 million and $439.9 million, respectively. If interest rates were to hypothetically increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of our cash equivalents and short-term investments would decrease by $8.8 million at June 25, 2017 and $9.6 million at June 26, 2016. We do not believe that a 10% change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs of June 25, 2017, we maintained a secured revolving line of credit under which we can borrow, repay and reborrow loans from time to time prior to its scheduled maturity date of January 9, 2020. At June 25, 2017 and June 26, 2016, we had $145 million and $160 million outstanding, respectively, under the line of credit. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the annual interest incurred under our line of credit would have increased by $1.5 million at June 25, 2017 and $1.6 million at June 26, 2016.\nCurrency Exchange Rates\nBecause we operate internationally and have transactions denominated in foreign currencies, including the Chinese Yuan and Euro, among others, we are exposed to currency exchange rate risks. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our expenses and results of operations as well as the value of our assets and liabilities. Our primary exposures relate to the exchange rates between (1) the U.S. Dollar and the Chinese Yuan and (2) the U.S. Dollar and the Taiwanese Dollar. A hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Yuan would result in a potential gain of approximately $0.4 million at June 25, 2017 and a potential loss of $1.0 million at June 26, 2016. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwanese Dollar was approximately $5.0 million at June 25, 2017 and $4.2 million at June 26, 2016.\nCommodities\nWe utilize significant amounts of precious metals, gases and other commodities in our manufacturing processes. General economic conditions, market specific changes or other factors outside of our control may affect the pricing of these commodities. We do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not use off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties, nor do we use any other forms of off-balance sheet arrangements. Accordingly, our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off-balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities. As of June 25, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nWe have entered into operating leases primarily for certain of our U.S. and international facilities in the normal course of business. Future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of June 25, 2017 are detailed above in Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in the section entitled Contractual Obligations.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In the application of U.S. GAAP, we are required to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Changes in the accounting estimates from period to period are reasonably likely to occur. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations may be affected.\nWe evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to revenue recognition, product warranty obligations, valuation of inventories, tax related contingencies, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of long-lived and intangible assets, other contingencies and litigation, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions, including expected trends that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We believe that the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates, each of which is critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Our management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and the related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize product revenue when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by persuasive evidence of an arrangement (typically in the form of a purchase order), when the sales price is fixed or determinable, collection of revenue is reasonably assured, and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer.\nWe provide our customers with limited rights of return for non-conforming shipments and product warranty claims. We estimate an allowance for anticipated sales returns based upon an analysis of historical sales returns and other relevant data. We recognize an allowance for non-conforming returns at the time of sale as a reduction of product revenue and as a reduction to the related accounts receivable balance. We recognize a liability for product warranty claims at the time of sale as an increase to cost of revenue.\nFor the year ended June 25, 2017, 56% of our revenue was from sales to distributors. Distributors stock inventory and sell our products to their own customer base, which may include: value added resellers; manufacturers who incorporate our products into their own manufactured goods; or ultimate end users of our products. We recognize revenue upon shipment of our products to our distributors. This arrangement is often referred to as a sell-in\u201d or point-of-purchase\u201d model as opposed to a sell-through\u201d or point-of-sale\u201d model, where revenue is deferred and not recognized until the distributor sells the product through to their customer.\nOur distributors may be provided limited rights that allow them to return a portion of inventory (product exchange rights or stock rotation rights) and receive credits for changes in selling prices (price protection rights) or customer pricing arrangements under our ship and debit\u201d program or other targeted sales incentives. When determining our net revenue, we make significant judgments and estimates corresponding with product shipments. We recognize a reserve for estimated future returns, changes in selling prices, and other targeted sales incentives when product ships. We also recognize an asset for the estimated value of product returns that we believe will be returned to inventory in the future and resold, and these estimates are based upon historical data, current economic trends, distributor inventory levels and other related factors. Our financial condition and operating results are dependent upon our ability to make reliable estimates. Actual results may vary and could have a significant impact on our operating results.\nFrom time to time, we will issue a new price book for our products, and provide a credit to certain distributors for inventory quantities on hand if required by our agreement with the distributor. This practice is known as price protection. These credits are applied against the reserve that we establish upon initial shipment of product to the distributor.\nUnder the ship and debit program, products are sold to distributors at negotiated prices and the distributors are required to pay for the products purchased within our standard commercial terms. Subsequent to the initial product purchase, a distributor may request a price allowance for a particular part number(s) for certain target customers, prior to the distributor reselling the particular part to that customer. If we approve an allowance and the distributor resells the product to the target customer, we credit the distributor according to the allowance we approved. These credits are applied against a reserve we establish upon initial shipment of product to the distributor.\nIn addition, we run sales incentive programs with certain distributors and retailers, such as product rebates and cooperative advertising campaigns. We recognize these incentives at the time they are offered to customers and record a credit to their account with an offsetting expense as either a reduction to revenue, increase to cost of revenue, or marketing expense depending on the type of sales incentive.\nWarranties\nProduct warranties are estimated and recognized at the time we recognize revenue. The warranty periods range from 90 days to 10 years. We estimate these warranty liabilities at the time of sale, based on historical and projected incident rates and expected future warranty costs. We estimate costs related to product recalls based on a formal campaign soliciting repair or return of that product when they are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. We evaluate our warranty reserves on a quarterly basis based on various factors including historical warranty claims, assumptions about the frequency of warranty claims, and assumptions about the frequency of product failures derived from quality testing, field monitoring and our reliability estimates. Actual product failure rates that materially differ from our estimates could have a significant impact on our operating results.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or an average cost method; and with market not to exceed net realizable value. We write-down our inventories for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand, specifically known inventory-related risks (such as technological obsolescence), and assumptions about future demand. We also analyze sales levels by product type, including historical and estimated future customer demand for those products to determine if any additional reserves are appropriate. For example, we adjust for items that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand, manufacturing process changes or new product introductions that may eliminate demand for the product. Any adjustment to our inventories as a result of an estimated obsolescence or net realizable condition is reflected as a component of our cost of revenue. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and any subsequent improvements in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established lower-cost basis.\nIn order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventories, we determine normal capacity for our manufacturing facilities based on historical patterns. If our estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate, or market conditions or technology change in ways that are less favorable than those projected by management, we may be required to take excess capacity charges in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nDeferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowances\nIn assessing the adequacy of a recognized valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets by jurisdiction. This consideration includes a variety of factors such as historical and projected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. When we establish or increase a valuation allowance, our income tax expense increases in the period such determination is made. If we decrease a valuation allowance, our income tax expense decreases in the period such a determination is made.\nTax Contingencies\nWe are subject to periodic audits of our income tax returns by federal, state, local and foreign agencies. These audits typically include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes\u201d (ASC 740), we regularly evaluate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. ASC 740 states that a tax benefit should not be recognized for financial statement purposes for an uncertain tax filing position where it is not more likely than not (likelihood of greater than 50%) for being sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.\nIn accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, we have established unrecognized tax benefits (as a reduction to the deferred tax asset or as an increase to other liabilities) to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following: the tax position is not more likely than not\u201d to be sustained; the tax position is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or the tax position is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information; the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position; and each tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. We adjust these unrecognized tax benefits, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit.\nA number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and fully resolved. To the extent we prevail in matters for which we have established an unrecognized benefit or are required to pay amounts in excess of what we have recognized, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement might require use of our cash and/or result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for awards of stock-based compensation under our employee stock-based compensation plans using the fair value method. Accordingly, we estimate the grant date fair value of our stock-based awards and amortize this fair value to compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term. We currently use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock option and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) awards. The determination of the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our then current stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.\nDue to the inherent limitations of option-valuation models, future events that are unpredictable and the estimation process utilized in determining the valuation of the stock-based awards, the ultimate value realized by award holders may vary significantly from the amounts expensed in our financial statements. For restricted stock and stock unit awards, grant date fair value is based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant. This fair value is then amortized to compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term.\nWe estimate expected forfeitures at the time of grant and revise this estimate, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. Our determination of an estimated forfeiture rate is primarily based upon a review of historical experience but may also include consideration of other facts and circumstances we believe are indicative of future activity. The assessment of an estimated forfeiture rate will not alter the total compensation expense to be recognized, only the timing of this recognition as compensation expense is adjusted to reflect instruments that actually vest.\nIf actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating key assumptions, we may be required to adjust compensation expense, which could be material to our results of operations.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets such as property, equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, such as patents, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets recognized in our financial statements may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider include whether there has been a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, a significant change in the way an asset is being used, or a significant change, delay or departure in our strategy for that asset. Our assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets involves significant judgment and estimation. These assessments reflect our assumptions, which, we believe, are consistent with the assumptions hypothetical marketplace participants use. Factors that we must estimate when performing recoverability and impairment tests include, among others, the economic life of the asset, sales volumes, prices, cost of capital, tax rates, and capital spending. These factors are often interdependent and therefore do not change in isolation. If impairment is indicated, we first determine if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amounts of the asset or assets. If so, an impairment loss is measured and recognized.\nAfter an impairment loss is recognized, a new, lower cost basis for that long-lived asset is established. Subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss.\nOur impairment loss calculations require that we apply judgment in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including estimating useful lives of the assets. To make these judgments, we may use internal discounted cash flow estimates, quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value.\nIf actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be required to recognize additional impairment losses which could be material to our results of operations.\nGoodwill\nWe test goodwill for impairment at least annually as of the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter, or when indications of potential impairment exist. We monitor for the existence of potential impairment indicators throughout the fiscal year. We conduct impairment testing for goodwill at the reporting unit level. Reporting units, as defined by FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d (ASC 350), may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. We have determined that our reporting units are our three operating and reportable segments.\nWe may initiate goodwill impairment testing by considering qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's carrying value is greater than its fair value. Such factors may include the following, among others: a significant decline in the reporting unit's expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition; and slower growth rates; as well as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, and customers. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform the two-step impairment test. Alternatively, we may bypass the qualitative test and initiate goodwill impairment testing with the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test.\nDuring the first step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. We derive a reporting unit's fair value through a combination of the market approach (a guideline transaction method) and the income approach (a discounted cash flow analysis). The income approach utilizes a discount rate from the capital asset pricing model. If all reporting units are analyzed during the first step of the goodwill impairment test, their respective fair values are reconciled back to our consolidated market capitalization.\nIf the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure possible goodwill impairment loss. During the second step, we hypothetically value the reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is compared to the carrying value of its goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill. Once an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying value of the goodwill becomes the new accounting basis of the goodwill for the reporting unit.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or when indications of potential impairment exist. We monitor for the existence of potential impairment indicators throughout the fiscal year. Our impairment test may begin with a qualitative test to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset's carrying value is greater than its fair value. In performing this test, we may consider the following qualitative factors, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; changes in industry and market conditions such as the deterioration in the environment in which we operate or an increased competitive environment; changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers; as well as other economic factors. If our qualitative assessment indicates that asset impairment is more likely than not, we perform a quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying value. Alternatively, we may bypass the qualitative test and initiate impairment testing with the quantitative impairment test.\nDetermining the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets entails significant estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, determining the timing and expected costs to complete development projects, estimating future cash flows from product revenue, developing appropriate discount rates, estimating probability rates for the successful completion of development projects, continuation of customer relationships and renewal of customer contracts, and approximating the useful lives of the intangible assets acquired.\nIf the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying value, we conclude that no impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying value. Once an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying value becomes the new accounting basis of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\nContingent Liabilities\nWe provide for contingent liabilities in accordance with U.S. GAAP, under which a loss contingency is charged to income when (1) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nPeriodically, we review the status of each significant matter to assess the potential financial exposure. If a potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we reflect the estimated loss in our results of operations. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and whether such loss is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based on the best information available at the time. Further, estimates of this nature are highly subjective, and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that may have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In determining the probability of an unfavorable outcome of a particular contingent liability and whether such liability is reasonably estimable, we consider the individual facts and circumstances related to the liability, opinions of legal counsel and recent legal rulings by the appropriate regulatory bodies, among other factors. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending and threatened claims and litigation and may revise our estimates accordingly. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nExecutive Summary\nThe following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, including a brief discussion of our business and products, key factors that impacted our performance and a summary of our operating results. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future periods.\nOverview\nCree, Inc. (Cree, we, our, or us) is a leading innovator of lighting-class light emitting diode (LED) products, lighting products and wide bandgap semiconductor products for power and radio-frequency (RF) applications. Our products are targeted for applications such as indoor and outdoor lighting, video displays, transportation, electronic signs and signals, power supplies, inverters and wireless systems. As discussed more fully below, we operate in three reportable segments: Lighting Products, LED Products and Wolfspeed.\nOur lighting products primarily consist of LED lighting systems and lamps. We design, manufacture and sell lighting fixtures and lamps for the commercial, industrial and consumer markets.\nOur LED products consist of LED chips and LED components. Our LED products enable our customers to develop and market LED-based products for lighting, video screens, automotive and other industrial applications.\nOur Wolfspeed business consists of silicon carbide (SiC) materials, power devices and RF devices based on wide bandgap semiconductor materials such as SiC and gallium nitride (GaN). Our materials products and power devices are used in solar, electric vehicles, motor drives, power supplies and transportation applications. Our RF devices are used in military communications, radar, satellite and telecommunication applications.\nAs discussed more fully in Note 1, Business,\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, on July 13, 2016, we executed a definitive agreement to sell the Wolfspeed business to Infineon Technologies AG (Infineon). Beginning in July 2016, the Company classified the results of the Wolfspeed business as discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated statements of loss for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets. On March 6, 2017, the definitive agreement with Infineon was terminated. As a result of the termination of the agreement, we have reclassified the results of the Wolfspeed business as continuing operations in our consolidated statements of loss, and presented it as a separate reportable segment, for all periods presented. Additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations were reclassified as held and used in the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented.\nThe majority of our products are manufactured at our production facilities located in North Carolina, Wisconsin and China. We also use contract manufacturers for certain products and aspects of product fabrication, assembly and packaging. We operate research and development facilities in North Carolina, Arkansas, California, Wisconsin, India, Italy and China (including Hong Kong).\nCree, Inc. is a North Carolina corporation established in 1987, and our headquarters are in Durham, North Carolina. For further information about our consolidated revenue and earnings, please see our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nReportable Segments\nOur three reportable segments are:\n \u2022 Lighting Products \n \u2022 LED Products \n \u2022 Wolfspeed  Reportable segments are components of an entity that have separate financial data that the entity's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) regularly reviews when allocating resources and assessing performance. Our CODM is the Chief Executive Officer.\nOur CODM does not review inter-segment transactions when evaluating segment performance and allocating resources to each segment, and inter-segment transactions are not included in our segment revenue disclosure. As such, total segment revenue is equal to our consolidated revenue.\nOur CODM reviews gross profit as the lowest and only level of segment profit. As such, all items below gross profit in the Consolidated Statements of Loss must be included to reconcile the consolidated gross profit to our consolidated loss before income taxes.\nFor financial results by reportable segment, please refer to Note 14, Reportable Segments,\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nIndustry Dynamics and Trends\nThere are a number of industry factors that affect our business which include, among others:\n \u2022 Overall Demand for Products and Applications using LEDs, SiC power devices and GaN RF devices. Our potential for growth depends significantly on the continued adoption of LEDs, the adoption of SiC and GaN substrate and device products in the power and RF markets, and our ability to win new designs for these applications. Demand also fluctuates based on various market cycles, continuously evolving industry supply chains, and evolving competitive dynamics in each of the respective markets. These uncertainties make demand difficult to forecast for us and our customers. \n \u2022 Intense and Constantly Evolving Competitive Environment. Competition in the industries we serve is intense. Many companies have made significant investments in product development and production equipment. Product pricing pressures exist as market participants often undertake pricing strategies to gain or protect market share, increase the utilization of their production capacity and open new applications to the LED, lighting, power and RF markets we serve. To remain competitive, market participants must continuously increase product performance, reduce costs and develop improved ways to serve their customers. To address these competitive pressures, we invest in research and development activities to support new product development, lower product costs and deliver higher levels of performance to differentiate our products in the market. In addition, we invest in systems, people and new processes to improve our ability to deliver a better overall experience for our customers. \n \u2022 Lighting Sales Channel Development. Commercial lighting is usually sold through lighting agents and distributors in the North American lighting market. The lighting agents typically have exclusive sales rights for a defined territory and are typically aligned with one large lighting company for a large percentage of their product sales. The size, quality and capability of the lighting agent has a significant effect on winning new projects and sales in a given geographic market. While these agents sell other lighting products, the large traditional lighting companies have taken steps to prevent their channel partners from selling competing product lines. We are constantly working to improve the capabilities of our existing channel partners and increase our share of their sales as well as develop new partners to improve our sales effectiveness in each geographic market. \n \u2022 Technological Innovation and Advancement. Innovations and advancements in LEDs, lighting and power and RF technologies continue to expand the potential commercial application for our products. However, new technologies or standards could emerge or improvements could be made in existing technologies that could reduce or limit the demand for our products in certain markets. \n \u2022 Intellectual Property Issues. Market participants rely on patented and non-patented proprietary information relating to product development, manufacturing capabilities and other core competencies of their business. Protection of intellectual property is critical. Therefore, steps such as additional patent applications, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, as well as other security measures are generally taken. To enforce or protect intellectual property rights, litigation or threatened litigation is common.  Fiscal 2017 Overview\nThe following is a summary of our financial results for the year ended June 25, 2017:\n \u2022 Our year-over-year revenue decreased by $144 million to $1.5 billion. \n \u2022 Gross margin remained flat at 30%. Gross profit decreased by $53 million to $435 million. \n \u2022 Operating loss was $19 million in fiscal 2017 compared to operating loss of $10 million in fiscal 2016. Net loss per diluted share was $1.00 in fiscal 2017 compared to net loss per diluted share of $0.21 in fiscal 2016. \n \u2022 Combined cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments remained flat at $0.6 billion at June 25, 2017 and June 26, 2016. Cash provided by operating activities was $216 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $203 million in fiscal 2016. \n \u2022 We spent $104 million to repurchase 4.4 million shares of our common stock during fiscal 2017. \n \u2022 We spent $87 million on purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2017 compared to $120 million in fiscal 2016.  Business Outlook\nWhile we believe that the markets for our products will remain highly competitive during fiscal 2018, we believe we are uniquely positioned as a market leading innovator in all three business segments and target growth in all three businesses over the next several years. These businesses are in different phases of their growth plans and generally operate on different market cycles. This is targeted to provide better business diversity and less cyclical results over time.\nWe are focused on the following priorities to support our goals of delivering higher revenue and profits over time:\n \u2022 Invest in the Wolfspeed business to increase capacity and further develop the technology to support longer term growth opportunities in SiC materials, SiC power devices and modules, and GaN RF devices. \n \u2022 Grow Lighting Products revenue and improve margins by investing in our channel relationships, improving execution, continuing to deliver innovative lighting solutions and by potentially acquiring complimentary businesses that are accretive to our earnings. \n \u2022 Grow the LED Products business by expanding our product offering with new products that leverage our market leadership to serve a larger share of existing customers' LED demand, while also opening new applications for our technology. \n \u2022 Improve the customer experience and service levels in all of our businesses. \nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of loss data for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages):\n\nLED Business Restructuring\nIn June 2015, our Board of Directors approved a plan to restructure the LED Products business. The restructuring reduced excess capacity and overhead in order to improve the cost structure moving forward. The primary components of the restructuring include the planned sale or abandonment of certain manufacturing equipment, facility consolidation and the elimination of certain positions. The restructuring activity ended in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, we realized $18.8 million in LED restructuring charges, which were partially offset by a $1.1 million gain on the sale of long-lived assets related to the restructuring which were sold for a value in excess of their estimated net realizable value during fiscal 2016.\nThe following table summarizes the actual charges incurred (in thousands): \nRevenue\nRevenue was comprised of the following (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nOur consolidated revenue decreased 9% to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2016. Lighting Products revenue decreased by 21% and LED Products revenue decreased slightly, while Wolfspeed revenue increased by 25%. For the fiscal year ended 2016, our consolidated revenue remained flat at $1.6 billion compared to fiscal 2015. Lighting Products revenue and LED Products revenue decreased by 2% and 1%, respectively, while Wolfspeed revenue increased by 3%.\nLighting Products Segment Revenue\nLighting Products revenue represented approximately 48%, 55%, and 56% of our total revenue for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. Lighting Products revenue was $701.5 million, $889.1 million, and $906.5 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively.\nLighting Products revenue decreased 21% to $701.5 million in fiscal 2017 from $889.1 million in fiscal 2016. This decrease was the result of a 15% decrease in units sold and an 11% decrease in average selling prices (ASP), partially offset by the incremental revenue associated with a patent license issuance fee in connection with a new patent license agreement. The decrease in units sold in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to lower sales in both our commercial and consumer channels. The decrease in ASP in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower consumer bulb prices year over year.\nLighting Products revenue decreased 2% to $889.1 million in fiscal 2016 from $906.5 million in fiscal 2015. This decrease was the result of lower consumer lighting sales which offset higher commercial lighting sales. The number of units sold decreased 22% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 due to lower consumer bulb sales and a change in mix, which was partially offset by an increase in ASP. The ASP increased 26% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a higher mix of commercial lighting fixtures, which have a higher ASP than our other lighting products.\nLED Products Segment Revenue\nLED Products revenue represented 37%, 34%, and 34% of our total revenue for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. LED Products revenue was $550.3 million, $551.2 million, and $555.0 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nLED Products revenue decreased slightly to $550.3 million in fiscal 2017 from $551.2 million in fiscal 2016. This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in licensing revenue mostly offset by increased product sales. The number of units sold increased 7% which was partially offset by 5% decrease in ASPs. The decrease in ASP in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to competitive pricing pressures.\nLED Products revenue decreased 1% to $551.2 million in fiscal 2016 from $555.0 million in fiscal 2015. This decrease was primarily a result of a reduction in ASP due to increased global competition for LED products which impacted both our LED chip and LED component product lines, partially offset by an increase in the overall number of units sold and an increase in license revenue associated with new patent license agreements. The ASP decreased 11% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and the overall number of units sold increased 12% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nWolfspeed Segment Revenue\nWolfspeed revenue represented approximately 15%, 11%, and 10% of our total revenue for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Wolfspeed revenue was $221.2 million, $176.3 million, and $171.0 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWolfspeed revenue increased 25% to $221.2 million in fiscal 2017 from $176.3 million in fiscal 2016. This increase was primarily the result of a 29% increase in the number of units sold and a 2% increase in ASP, which were partially offset by a decrease in contract revenue. The increase in units sold in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was the result of increases across all products. The increase in ASP in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a greater mix of higher priced material substrate and RF device products.\nWolfspeed revenue increased 3% to $176.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $171.0 million in fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily the result of higher substrate and contract revenue, partially offset by lower device sales. ASPs increased 17% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, partially offset by a 17% decrease in the number of units sold. The increase in ASP was due to a higher substrate sale mix and a greater mix of higher priced power and RF products. The decrease in units sold was primarily the result of lower RF units sold.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit and gross margin were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nOur consolidated gross profit decreased 11% to $434.6 million in fiscal 2017 from $487.1 million in fiscal 2016. Our consolidated gross margin remained flat at 30% in fiscal 2017 and in fiscal 2016. Our consolidated gross profit increased 3% to $487.1 million in fiscal 2016 from $473.9 million in fiscal 2015. Our consolidated gross margin increased to 30% in fiscal 2016 from 29% in fiscal 2015.\nLighting Products Segment Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nLighting Products gross profit was $196.2 million, $238.2 million, and $235.5 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Lighting Products gross margin was 28%, 27%, and 26% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nLighting Products gross profit decreased 18% to $196.2 million in fiscal 2017 from $238.2 million in fiscal 2016. Lighting Products gross margin increased to 28% in fiscal 2017 from 27% in fiscal 2016. Lighting Products gross profit decreased primarily due to lower lighting product sales, higher commercial lighting product warranty reserves, and lower factory utilization, which were partially offset by a patent license issuance fee. Lighting Products gross margin increased due to the patent license issuance fee revenue, partially offset by the higher commercial lighting product warranty reserves and lower factory utilization from lower lighting product sales.\nLighting Products gross profit increased 1% to $238.2 million in fiscal 2016 from $235.5 million in fiscal 2015. Lighting Products gross margin increased to 27% in fiscal 2016 from 26% in fiscal 2015. Lighting Products gross profit and gross margin increased due to a more favorable mix of commercial lighting fixtures and the benefit of factory cost reductions.\nLED Products Segment Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nOur LED Products gross profit was $151.7 million, $173.8 million, and $159.0 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. LED Products gross margin was 28%, 32%, and 29% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nLED Products gross profit decreased 13% to $151.7 million in fiscal 2017 from $173.8 million in fiscal 2016, and LED Products gross margin decreased to 28% in fiscal 2017 from 32% in fiscal 2016. LED Products gross profit and gross margin decreased due to lower license revenue, lower pricing resulting from the increased global competition for LED products and a less favorable mix of LED products sold.\nLED Products gross profit increased 9% to $173.8 million in fiscal 2016 from $159.0 million in fiscal 2015, and LED Products gross margin increased to 32% in fiscal 2016 from 29% in fiscal 2015. LED Products gross profit and gross margin increased due to higher license revenue and higher units sold, partially offset by lower pricing. In fiscal 2015, LED Products gross profit and gross margin were negatively impacted by increases in channel inventory reserves and inventory reserves pursuant to our restructuring plan, as well as lower factory utilization resulting from lower demand and our targeted actions in the latter half of fiscal 2015 to reduce inventory balances for our LED Products segment.\nWolfspeed Segment Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nWolfspeed gross profit was $103.5 million, $94.6 million, and $99.7 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Wolfspeed gross margin was 47%, 54%, and 58% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWolfspeed gross profit increased 9% to $103.5 million in fiscal 2017 from $94.6 million in fiscal 2016. Wolfspeed gross margin decreased to 47% in fiscal 2017 from 54% in fiscal 2016. Wolfspeed gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Wolfspeed gross margin decreased primarily due to costs associated with new product ramp ups and changes in product mix.\nWolfspeed gross profit decreased 5% to $94.6 million in fiscal 2016 from $99.7 million in fiscal 2015. Wolfspeed gross margin decreased to 54% in fiscal 2016 from 58% in fiscal 2015. Wolfspeed gross profit and gross margin decreased primarily due to costs associated with new product ramp ups and changes in product mix.\nUnallocated Costs\nUnallocated costs were $16.8 million, $19.6 million, and $20.3 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These costs consisted primarily of manufacturing employees' stock-based compensation, expenses for profit sharing and quarterly or annual incentive plans and matching contributions under our 401(k) plan. These costs were not allocated to the reportable segments' gross profit because our CODM does not review them regularly when evaluating segment performance and allocating resources.\nUnallocated costs decreased by $2.8 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower stock-based compensation incurred as a result of our lower average share price.\nUnallocated costs decreased by $0.7 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to lower stock-based compensation incurred as a result of our lower average share price.\nFor further information on the allocation of costs to segment gross profit, refer to Note 14, Reportable Segments,\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products, enhancements of existing products and general technology research. These costs consisted primarily of employee salaries and related compensation costs, occupancy costs, consulting costs and the cost of development equipment and supplies.\nThe following sets forth our research and development expenses in dollars and as a percentage of revenue (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased in fiscal 2017 to $158.5 million compared to $168.8 million in fiscal 2016, which decreased from $182.8 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to cost management and the nature of current research and development projects. The decrease in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a shift in emphasis to lighting-related research and development, which is inherently less expensive than LED research and development.\nOur research and development expenses vary significantly from year to year based on a number of factors, including the timing of new product introductions and the number and nature of our ongoing research and development activities.\nSales, General and Administrative\nSales, general and administrative expenses were comprised primarily of costs associated with our sales and marketing personnel and our executive and administrative personnel (for example, finance, human resources, information technology and legal) and consisted of salaries and related compensation costs; consulting and other professional services (such as litigation and other outside legal counsel fees, audit and other compliance costs); marketing and advertising expenses; facilities and insurance costs; and travel and other costs. The following table sets forth our sales, general and administrative expenses in dollars and as a percentage of revenue (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nSales, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2017 decreased 2% to $277.2 million from $283.1 million in fiscal 2016, which was a 3% decrease from $290.7 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower spending on corporate sales and marketing expenses related to lower sales and a decrease in litigation spending partially offset by higher Wolfspeed transaction expenses. The decrease in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower spending on corporate sales and marketing expenses related to lower sales, partially offset by an increase in legal fees associated with intellectual property protection and enforcement.\nAmortization or Impairment of Acquisition-Related Intangibles\nAs a result of our acquisitions, we have recognized various amortizable intangible assets, including customer relationships, developed technology, non-compete agreements and trade names.\nAmortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions was as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to less amortization expense for customer relationships and non-compete agreements in fiscal 2017. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the amortization of developed technology related to the acquisition of Arkansas Power Electronics International, Inc. (APEI) that was placed in service in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles increased in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to the APEI acquisition as discussed in Note 3, Acquisition,\u201d in our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nLoss on Disposal or Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe operate a capital intensive business. As such, we dispose of a certain level of our equipment in the normal course of business as our production processes change due to production improvement initiatives or product mix changes. Due to the risk of technological obsolescence or changes in our production process, we regularly review our equipment and capitalized patent costs for possible impairment. The following table sets forth our loss on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nWe recognized a net loss of $2.5 million, $16.9 million, and $47.7 million on the disposal of long-lived assets in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The decrease in net loss in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the planned sale or abandonment of certain long-lived assets in fiscal 2016 to reduce excess manufacturing capacity pursuant to our restructuring plan discussed above. The net losses in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 were primarily due to the planned sale or abandonment of certain long-lived assets to reduce excess manufacturing capacity pursuant to our restructuring plan discussed above.\nWolfspeed Transaction Termination Fee\nAs discussed more fully in Note 1, Business,\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, as a result of the termination of the agreement to sell the Wolfspeed business to Infineon, Infineon paid us a termination fee of $12.5 million in cash on March 10, 2017.\nNon-Operating Income (Expense), net\nThe following table sets forth our non-operating income (expense), net (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nDuring fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we were in a net interest income position. Our short-term investments consisted primarily of municipal bonds, corporate bonds, U.S. agency securities, non-U.S. certificates of deposit and non-U.S. government securities. The primary objective of our investment policy is preservation of principal. Other long-term investments consisted of our approximately 15% common stock ownership interest in Lextar Electronics Corporation (Lextar), which was completed in December 2014. This investment was accounted for under the equity method from the date of investment until June 2016 when we chose for our representative not to stand for re-election as a member of the Lextar board of directors. We utilize the fair value option in accounting for our investment in Lextar.\nGain on sale of investments, net. Gain on sale of investments, net was $93 thousand, $238 thousand and $925 thousand in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. Gain on sale of investments, net decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower sales of investments. Gain on sale of investments, net decreased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower sales of investments.\nGain (loss) on equity investment. Gain on equity investment was $7.5 million in fiscal 2017 and loss on equity investment was $15.4 million and $22.6 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. We had a gain on equity investment in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in the fair value of our Lextar investment. We had a loss on equity investment in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 due to decreases in the fair value of our Lextar investment. Lextar's stock is publicly traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange and its share price increased from 15.70 New Taiwanese Dollars (TWD) at June 26, 2016 to 18.40 TWD at June 25, 2017. Lextar's share price declined from 30 TWD at the date of our investment in December 2014 to 21.55 TWD at June 28, 2015 and to 15.70 TWD at June 26, 2016. This volatile stock price trend may continue in the future given the risks inherent in Lextar's business and trends affecting the Taiwan and global equity markets. Any future stock price changes will be recorded as further gains or losses on equity investment based on the increase or decrease, respectively, in the fair value of the investment during the applicable fiscal period. Further losses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nDividends from equity investment. Dividends from equity investment were $0.0 million, $1.7 million and $2.6 million in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively, due to our Lextar investment.\nInterest income, net. Interest income, net was $3.7 million, $4.5 million and $9.1 million in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. The decrease in interest income, net in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower invested balances and higher interest expense due to overall higher borrowings associated with our line of credit, partially offset by higher investment yields. The decrease in interest income, net in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower invested balances and higher interest expense due to overall higher borrowings associated with our line of credit, partially offset by higher investment yields.\nForeign currency gain (loss), net. Foreign currency gain (loss), net consisted primarily of remeasurement adjustments resulting from our Lextar investment and consolidating our international subsidiaries. The foreign currency gain, net in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to favorable fluctuations in the exchange rate between both the Chinese Yuan and the Euro and the United States Dollar which was partially offset by an unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the TWD and the United States Dollar related to our Lextar investment. The foreign currency loss, net in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the TWD and the United States Dollar related to our Lextar investment and unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the Chinese Yuan and the United States Dollar. The foreign currency gain, net for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the TWD and the United States Dollar related to our Lextar investment and unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the Euro and the United States Dollar.\nOther, net. Other, net was $200 thousand, $457 thousand and $572 thousand in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nThe following table sets forth our income tax expense (benefit) in dollars and our effective tax rate (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nWe recognized income tax expense of $93.5 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to income tax benefit of $2.0 million in fiscal 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 8% in fiscal 2016 to (2,004)% in fiscal 2017 was due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets and other deferred charges in a period of a pre-tax loss, as discussed more fully in Note 12 Income Taxes\u201d to our audited financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 23% in fiscal 2015 to 8% in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on foreign net operating loss carryovers during fiscal 2016.\nThe variation between our effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent is due to: (i) changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Luxembourg, (ii) income derived from international locations with lower tax rates than the U.S., and (iii) tax credits generated.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including outlays for research and development, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, marketable securities, cash generated from operations and availability under our line of credit. Our ability to generate cash from operations has been one of our fundamental strengths and has provided us with substantial flexibility in meeting our operating, financing and investing needs. We have a $500 million line of credit as discussed in Note 8, Long-term Debt,\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. The purpose of this facility is to provide short term flexibility to optimize returns on our cash and investment portfolio while funding share repurchases, capital expenditures and other general business needs.\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our current working capital, availability under our line of credit and anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. We may use a portion of our available cash and cash equivalents, line of credit or funds underlying our marketable securities to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors. With our strong working capital position, we believe that we have the ability to continue to invest in further development of our products and, when necessary or appropriate, make selective acquisitions or other strategic investments to strengthen our product portfolio, secure key intellectual properties or expand our production capacity.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, spin-offs or investments in complementary businesses, and we anticipate continuing to make such evaluations. We may also access capital markets through the issuance of debt or additional shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of complementary businesses or other significant assets or for other strategic opportunities.\nContractual Obligations\nAt June 25, 2017, payments to be made pursuant to significant contractual obligations are as follows (in thousands):\n\n1Interest payments on long-term debt are based on the interest rate at June 25, 2017.\n2 Other long-term liabilities as of June 25, 2017 included long-term tax contingencies and other tax liabilities of $49.9 million, deferred liabilities of $0.4 million and other long-term contingent liabilities (for example, warranties) of $19.8 million. These liabilities were not included in the table above as they will either not be settled in cash and/or the timing of any payments is uncertain.\nOperating lease obligations include rental amounts due on leases of certain office and manufacturing space under the terms of non-cancelable operating leases. These leases expire at various times through April 2024. Most of the lease agreements provide for rental adjustments for increases in base rent, property taxes and general property maintenance that would be recognized as rent expense, if applicable.\nPurchase obligations represent purchase commitments, including open purchase orders and contracts, and are generally related to the purchase of goods and services in the ordinary course of business such as raw materials, supplies and capital equipment.\nFinancial Condition\nThe following table sets forth our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (in thousands):\n\nOur liquidity and capital resources primarily depend on our cash flows from operations and our working capital. The significant components of our working capital are liquid assets such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and inventories reduced by trade accounts payable.\nThe following table presents the components of our cash conversion cycle:\n\n a) Days of sales outstanding (DSO) measures the average collection period of our receivables. DSO is based on the ending net trade receivables and the revenue, net for the quarter then ended. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of applicable allowances and reserves, by the average net revenue per day for the respective 90 day period. \n b) Days of supply in inventory (DSI) measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DSI is based on ending inventory and cost of revenue, net for the quarter then ended. DSI is calculated by dividing ending inventory by average cost of revenue, net per day for the respective 90 day period. \n c) Days in accounts payable (DPO) measures the average number of days our payables remain outstanding before payment. DPO is based on ending accounts payable and cost of revenue, net for the quarter then ended. DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by the average cost of revenue, net per day for the respective 90 day period.  The decrease in the cash conversion cycle was primarily driven by an increase in days in accounts payable and decreases in days of sales outstanding and in days of supply in inventory.\nAs of June 25, 2017, we had unrealized losses on our investments of $0.3 million. All of our investments had investment grade ratings, and any such investments that were in an unrealized loss position at June 25, 2017 were in such position due to interest rate changes, sector credit rating changes or company-specific rating changes. As we intend and believe that we have the ability to hold such investments for a period of time that will be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value, we currently expect to receive the full principal or recover our cost basis in these securities. The declines in value of the securities in our portfolio are considered to be temporary in nature and, accordingly, we do not believe these securities are impaired as of June 25, 2017.\nCash Flows\nIn summary, our cash flows were as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe following is a discussion of our primary sources and uses of cash in our operating, investing and financing activities.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased to $215.9 million in fiscal 2017 from $203.3 million in fiscal 2016, primarily due to cash generated from working capital, partially offset by a higher net loss in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $203.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $181.3 million in fiscal 2015, primarily due to a lower net loss in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur investing activities primarily relate to transactions within our short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment and payments for patents and licensing rights. Net cash used in investing activities was $145.3 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $7.9 million in fiscal 2016. Purchases of property, equipment and patent rights decreased by $35.1 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Net purchases of short-term investments increased $181.1 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. This year over year increase was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the sale and maturities of short-term investments, partially offset by a decrease in short-term investment purchase activity. Fiscal 2016 included $12.5 million in net expenditures to acquire APEI.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $7.9 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $16.1 million in fiscal 2015. Purchases of property, equipment and patent rights decreased by $91.2 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Net proceeds from the sale of short-term investments decreased $156 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. This year over year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the sale and maturities of short-term investments, partially offset by a decrease in short-term investment purchase activity. Fiscal 2016 included $12.5 million in net expenditures to acquire APEI while fiscal 2015 included the $80.6 million investment in Lextar.\nFor fiscal 2018, we target approximately $220 million of capital investment, which is primarily related to infrastructure projects to support our longer term growth and strategic priorities.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $104.1 million in fiscal 2017 compared to net cash used by financing activities of $167.9 million in fiscal 2016. Our financing activities for fiscal 2017 primarily consisted of repurchases of common stock of $104.0 million and net payments on long-term debt borrowings of $15.0 million on our line of credit, partially offset by proceeds of $17.7 million from net issuances of common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, including the excess tax benefit on those exercises. Fiscal 2017 included payment of $2.8 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration related to our fiscal 2016 acquisition of APEI.\nIn fiscal 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $167.9 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $311.4 million in fiscal 2015. Our financing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily consisted of repurchases of common stock of $149.6 million and net payments on long-term borrowings of $40.0 million on our line of credit, partially offset by proceeds of $21.7 million from net issuances of common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, including the excess tax benefit on those exercises.\nOn August 24, 2016, the Board of Directors approved our fiscal 2017 stock repurchase program, authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock having an aggregate purchase price not exceeding $300 million for all purchases from August 24, 2016 through the expiration of the program on June 25, 2017.\nOn June 14, 2017, the Board of Directors approved our fiscal 2018 stock repurchase program, authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock having an aggregate purchase price not exceeding $200 million for all purchases from June 26, 2017 through the expiration of the program on June 24, 2018. Since the inception of our stock repurchase program in 2001, we have repurchased 38.7 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $28.66 per share with an aggregate value of $1.1 billion. The repurchase program may be implemented through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of our management.\nFair Value\nUnder U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches, including quoted market prices and discounted cash flows. U.S. GAAP also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:\n \u2022 Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that we are able to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment. \n \u2022 Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for instruments that are similar, or quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar instruments, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. \n \u2022 Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.  The financial assets for which we perform recurring fair value remeasurements are cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of June 25, 2017, financial assets utilizing Level 1 inputs included money market funds. Financial assets utilizing Level 2 inputs included municipal bonds, corporate bonds, non-U.S. certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and common stock of non-U.S. corporations. Level 2 assets are valued using a third-party pricing service's consensus price which is a weighted average price based on multiple sources. These sources determine prices utilizing market income models which factor in, where applicable, transactions of similar assets in active markets, transactions of identical assets in infrequent markets, interest rates, bond or credit default swap spreads and volatility. We do not have any financial assets requiring the use of Level 3 inputs. Please refer to Note 6, Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information.\nFinancial and Market Risks\nWe are exposed to financial and market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodities risk. We have entered and may in the future enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments in an effort to manage or hedge some of our foreign exchange rate risk. We may not be able to engage in hedging transactions in the future, and even if we do, foreign currency fluctuations may still have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial performance. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial positions at June 25, 2017 and June 26, 2016. Actual results may differ materially.\nInterest Rates\nWe maintain an investment portfolio principally composed of money market funds, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. In order to minimize risk, our cash management policy permits us to acquire investments rated A\u201d grade or better. As of June 25, 2017 and June 26, 2016, our cash equivalents and short-term investments had a fair value of $482.1 million and $439.9 million, respectively. If interest rates were to hypothetically increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of our cash equivalents and short-term", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nExecutive Summary\nThe following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, including a brief discussion of our business and products, key factors that impacted our performance and a summary of our operating results. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future periods.\nOverview\nCree, Inc. (Cree, we, our, or us) is a leading innovator of lighting-class light emitting diode (LED) products, lighting products and wide bandgap semiconductor products for power and radio-frequency (RF) applications. Our products are targeted for applications such as indoor and outdoor lighting, video displays, transportation, electronic signs and signals, power supplies, inverters and wireless systems. As discussed more fully below, we operate in three reportable segments: Lighting Products, LED Products and Wolfspeed.\nOur lighting products primarily consist of LED lighting systems and lamps. We design, manufacture and sell lighting fixtures and lamps for the commercial, industrial and consumer markets.\nOur LED products consist of LED chips and LED components. Our LED products enable our customers to develop and market LED-based products for lighting, video screens, automotive and other industrial applications.\nOur Wolfspeed business consists of silicon carbide (SiC) materials, power devices and RF devices based on wide bandgap semiconductor materials such as SiC and gallium nitride (GaN). Our materials products and power devices are used in solar, electric vehicles, motor drives, power supplies and transportation applications. Our RF devices are used in military communications, radar, satellite and telecommunication applications.\nAs discussed more fully in Note 1, Business,\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, on July 13, 2016, we executed a definitive agreement to sell the Wolfspeed business to Infineon Technologies AG (Infineon). Beginning in July 2016, the Company classified the results of the Wolfspeed business as discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated statements of loss for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets. On March 6, 2017, the definitive agreement with Infineon was terminated. As a result of the termination of the agreement, we have reclassified the results of the Wolfspeed business as continuing operations in our consolidated statements of loss, and presented it as a separate reportable segment, for all periods presented. Additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations were reclassified as held and used in the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented.\nThe majority of our products are manufactured at our production facilities located in North Carolina, Wisconsin and China. We also use contract manufacturers for certain products and aspects of product fabrication, assembly and packaging. We operate research and development facilities in North Carolina, Arkansas, California, Wisconsin, India, Italy and China (including Hong Kong).\nCree, Inc. is a North Carolina corporation established in 1987, and our headquarters are in Durham, North Carolina. For further information about our consolidated revenue and earnings, please see our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nReportable Segments\nOur three reportable segments are:\n \u2022 Lighting Products \n \u2022 LED Products \n \u2022 Wolfspeed  Reportable segments are components of an entity that have separate financial data that the entity's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) regularly reviews when allocating resources and assessing performance. Our CODM is the Chief Executive Officer.\nOur CODM does not review inter-segment transactions when evaluating segment performance and allocating resources to each segment, and inter-segment transactions are not included in our segment revenue disclosure. As such, total segment revenue is equal to our consolidated revenue.\nOur CODM reviews gross profit as the lowest and only level of segment profit. As such, all items below gross profit in the Consolidated Statements of Loss must be included to reconcile the consolidated gross profit to our consolidated loss before income taxes.\nFor financial results by reportable segment, please refer to Note 14, Reportable Segments,\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nIndustry Dynamics and Trends\nThere are a number of industry factors that affect our business which include, among others:\n \u2022 Overall Demand for Products and Applications using LEDs, SiC power devices and GaN RF devices. Our potential for growth depends significantly on the continued adoption of LEDs, the adoption of SiC and GaN substrate and device products in the power and RF markets, and our ability to win new designs for these applications. Demand also fluctuates based on various market cycles, continuously evolving industry supply chains, and evolving competitive dynamics in each of the respective markets. These uncertainties make demand difficult to forecast for us and our customers. \n \u2022 Intense and Constantly Evolving Competitive Environment. Competition in the industries we serve is intense. Many companies have made significant investments in product development and production equipment. Product pricing pressures exist as market participants often undertake pricing strategies to gain or protect market share, increase the utilization of their production capacity and open new applications to the LED, lighting, power and RF markets we serve. To remain competitive, market participants must continuously increase product performance, reduce costs and develop improved ways to serve their customers. To address these competitive pressures, we invest in research and development activities to support new product development, lower product costs and deliver higher levels of performance to differentiate our products in the market. In addition, we invest in systems, people and new processes to improve our ability to deliver a better overall experience for our customers. \n \u2022 Lighting Sales Channel Development. Commercial lighting is usually sold through lighting agents and distributors in the North American lighting market. The lighting agents typically have exclusive sales rights for a defined territory and are typically aligned with one large lighting company for a large percentage of their product sales. The size, quality and capability of the lighting agent has a significant effect on winning new projects and sales in a given geographic market. While these agents sell other lighting products, the large traditional lighting companies have taken steps to prevent their channel partners from selling competing product lines. We are constantly working to improve the capabilities of our existing channel partners and increase our share of their sales as well as develop new partners to improve our sales effectiveness in each geographic market. \n \u2022 Technological Innovation and Advancement. Innovations and advancements in LEDs, lighting and power and RF technologies continue to expand the potential commercial application for our products. However, new technologies or standards could emerge or improvements could be made in existing technologies that could reduce or limit the demand for our products in certain markets. \n \u2022 Intellectual Property Issues. Market participants rely on patented and non-patented proprietary information relating to product development, manufacturing capabilities and other core competencies of their business. Protection of intellectual property is critical. Therefore, steps such as additional patent applications, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, as well as other security measures are generally taken. To enforce or protect intellectual property rights, litigation or threatened litigation is common.  Fiscal 2017 Overview\nThe following is a summary of our financial results for the year ended June 25, 2017:\n \u2022 Our year-over-year revenue decreased by $144 million to $1.5 billion. \n \u2022 Gross margin remained flat at 30%. Gross profit decreased by $53 million to $435 million. \n \u2022 Operating loss was $19 million in fiscal 2017 compared to operating loss of $10 million in fiscal 2016. Net loss per diluted share was $1.00 in fiscal 2017 compared to net loss per diluted share of $0.21 in fiscal 2016. \n \u2022 Combined cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments remained flat at $0.6 billion at June 25, 2017 and June 26, 2016. Cash provided by operating activities was $216 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $203 million in fiscal 2016. \n \u2022 We spent $104 million to repurchase 4.4 million shares of our common stock during fiscal 2017. \n \u2022 We spent $87 million on purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2017 compared to $120 million in fiscal 2016.  Business Outlook\nWhile we believe that the markets for our products will remain highly competitive during fiscal 2018, we believe we are uniquely positioned as a market leading innovator in all three business segments and target growth in all three businesses over the next several years. These businesses are in different phases of their growth plans and generally operate on different market cycles. This is targeted to provide better business diversity and less cyclical results over time.\nWe are focused on the following priorities to support our goals of delivering higher revenue and profits over time:\n \u2022 Invest in the Wolfspeed business to increase capacity and further develop the technology to support longer term growth opportunities in SiC materials, SiC power devices and modules, and GaN RF devices. \n \u2022 Grow Lighting Products revenue and improve margins by investing in our channel relationships, improving execution, continuing to deliver innovative lighting solutions and by potentially acquiring complimentary businesses that are accretive to our earnings. \n \u2022 Grow the LED Products business by expanding our product offering with new products that leverage our market leadership to serve a larger share of existing customers' LED demand, while also opening new applications for our technology. \n \u2022 Improve the customer experience and service levels in all of our businesses. \nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of loss data for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share amounts

approved a plan to restructure the LED Products business. The restructuring reduced excess capacity and overhead in order to improve the cost structure moving forward. The primary components of the restructuring include the planned sale or abandonment of certain manufacturing equipment, facility consolidation and the elimination of certain positions. The restructuring activity ended in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, we realized $18.8 million in LED restructuring charges, which were partially offset by a $1.1 million gain on the sale of long-lived assets related to the restructuring which were sold for a value in excess of their estimated net realizable value during fiscal 2016.\nThe following table summarizes the actual charges incurred (in thousands): Table 120: <table><tr><td> </td>

Lighting Products revenue decreased by 21% and LED Products revenue decreased slightly, while Wolfspeed revenue increased by 25%. For the fiscal year ended 2016, our consolidated revenue remained flat at $1.6 billion compared to fiscal 2015. Lighting Products revenue and LED Products revenue decreased by 2% and 1%, respectively, while Wolfspeed revenue increased by 3%.\nLighting Products Segment Revenue\nLighting Products revenue represented approximately 48%, 55%, and 56% of our total revenue for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. Lighting Products revenue was $701.5 million, $889.1 million, and $906.5 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively.\nLighting Products revenue decreased 21% to $701.5 million in fiscal 2017 from $889.1 million in fiscal 2016. This decrease was the result of a 15% decrease in units sold and an 11% decrease in average selling prices (ASP), partially offset by the incremental revenue associated with a patent license issuance fee in connection with a new patent license agreement. The decrease in units sold in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to lower sales in both our commercial and consumer channels. The decrease in ASP in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower consumer bulb prices year over year.\nLighting Products revenue decreased 2% to $889.1 million in fiscal 2016 from $906.5 million in fiscal 2015. This decrease was the result of lower consumer lighting sales which offset higher commercial lighting sales. The number of units sold decreased 22% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 due to lower consumer bulb sales and a change in mix, which was partially offset by an increase in ASP. The ASP increased 26% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a higher mix of commercial lighting fixtures, which have a higher ASP than our other lighting products.\nLED Products Segment Revenue\nLED Products revenue represented 37%, 34%, and 34% of our total revenue for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. LED Products revenue was $550.3 million, $551.2 million, and $555.0 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nLED Products revenue decreased slightly to $550.3 million in fiscal 2017 from $551.2 million in fiscal 2016. This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in licensing revenue mostly offset by increased product sales. The number of units sold increased 7% which was partially offset by 5% decrease in ASPs. The decrease in ASP in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to competitive pricing pressures.\nLED Products revenue decreased 1% to $551.2 million in fiscal 2016 from $555.0 million in fiscal 2015. This decrease was primarily a result of a reduction in ASP due to increased global competition for LED products which impacted both our LED chip and LED component product lines, partially offset by an increase in the overall number of units sold and an increase in license revenue associated with new patent license agreements. The ASP decreased 11% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and the overall number of units sold increased 12% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nWolfspeed Segment Revenue\nWolfspeed revenue represented approximately 15%, 11%, and 10% of our total revenue for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Wolfspeed revenue was $221.2 million, $176.3 million, and $171.0 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWolfspeed revenue increased 25% to $221.2 million in fiscal 2017 from $176.3 million in fiscal 2016. This increase was primarily the result of a 29% increase in the number of units sold and a 2% increase in ASP, which were partially offset by a decrease in contract revenue. The increase in units sold in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was the result of increases across all products. The increase in ASP in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a greater mix of higher priced material substrate and RF device products.\nWolfspeed revenue increased 3% to $176.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $171.0 million in fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily the result of higher substrate and contract revenue, partially offset by lower device sales. ASPs increased 17% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, partially offset by a 17% decrease in the number of units sold. The increase in ASP was due to a higher substrate sale mix and a greater mix of higher priced power and RF products. The decrease in units sold was primarily the result of lower RF units sold.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit and gross margin were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-Over-Year Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>June 25, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 26, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 28, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lighting Products gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$196,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$238,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$235,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($42,024\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lighting Products gross margin\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LED Products\n</td> <td>151,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22,139\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LED Products Gross Margin\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wolfspeed gross profit\n</td> <td>103,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,099\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wolfspeed gross margin\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated costs\n</td> <td>(16,786\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,604\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,299\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$434,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$487,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$473,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($52,502\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$13,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated gross margin\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur consolidated gross profit decreased 11% to $434.6 million in fiscal 2017 from $487.1 million in fiscal 2016.

Our consolidated gross margin increased to 30% in fiscal 2016 from 29% in fiscal 2015.\nLighting Products Segment Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nLighting Products gross profit was $196.2 million, $238.2 million, and $235.5 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Lighting Products gross margin was 28%, 27%, and 26% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nLighting Products gross profit decreased 18% to $196.2 million in fiscal 2017 from $238.2 million in fiscal 2016. Lighting Products gross margin increased to 28% in fiscal 2017 from 27% in fiscal 2016. Lighting Products gross profit decreased primarily due to lower lighting product sales, higher commercial lighting product warranty reserves, and lower factory utilization, which were partially offset by a patent license issuance fee. Lighting Products gross margin increased due to the patent license issuance fee revenue, partially offset by the higher commercial lighting product warranty reserves and lower factory utilization from lower lighting product sales.\nLighting Products gross profit increased 1% to $238.2 million in fiscal 2016 from $235.5 million in fiscal 2015. Lighting Products gross margin increased to 27% in fiscal 2016 from 26% in fiscal 2015. Lighting Products gross profit and gross margin increased due to a more favorable mix of commercial lighting fixtures and the benefit of factory cost reductions.\nLED Products Segment Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nOur LED Products gross profit was $151.7 million, $173.8 million, and $159.0 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

LED Products gross profit and gross margin increased due to higher license revenue and higher units sold, partially offset by lower pricing. In fiscal 2015, LED Products gross profit and gross margin were negatively impacted by increases in channel inventory reserves and inventory reserves pursuant to our restructuring plan, as well as lower factory utilization resulting from lower demand and our targeted actions in the latter half of fiscal 2015 to reduce inventory balances for our LED Products segment.\nWolfspeed Segment Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nWolfspeed gross profit was $103.5 million, $94.6 million, and $99.7 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Wolfspeed gross margin was 47%, 54%, and 58% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWolfspeed gross profit increased 9% to $103.5 million in fiscal 2017 from $94.6 million in fiscal 2016. Wolfspeed gross margin decreased to 47% in fiscal 2017 from 54% in fiscal 2016. Wolfspeed gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Wolfspeed gross margin decreased primarily due to costs associated with new product ramp ups and changes in product mix.\nWolfspeed gross profit decreased 5% to $94.6 million in fiscal 2016 from $99.7 million in fiscal 2015. Wolfspeed gross margin decreased to 54% in fiscal 2016 from 58% in fiscal 2015. Wolfspeed gross profit and gross margin decreased primarily due to costs associated with new product ramp ups and changes in product mix.\nUnallocated Costs\nUnallocated costs were $16.8 million, $19.6 million, and $20.3 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These costs consisted primarily of manufacturing employees' stock-based compensation, expenses for profit sharing and quarterly or annual incentive plans and matching contributions under our 401(k) plan. These costs were not allocated to the reportable segments' gross profit because our CODM does not review them regularly when evaluating segment performance and allocating resources.\nUnallocated costs decreased by $2.8 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower stock-based compensation incurred as a result of our lower average share price.\nUnallocated costs decreased by $0.7 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to lower stock-based compensation incurred as a result of our lower average share price.\nFor further information on the allocation of costs to segment gross profit, refer to Note 14, Reportable Segments,\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products, enhancements of existing products and general technology research. These costs consisted primarily of employee salaries and related compensation costs, occupancy costs, consulting costs and the cost of development equipment and supplies.\nThe following sets forth our research and development expenses in dollars and as a percentage of revenue (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-Over-Year Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>June 25, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 26, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 28, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$158,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$168,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$182,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($10,299\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($13,949\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of revenue\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses decreased in fiscal 2017 to $158.5 million compared to $168.8 million in fiscal 2016, which decreased from $182.8 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to cost management and the nature of current research and development projects. The decrease in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a shift in emphasis to lighting-related research and development, which is inherently less expensive than LED research and development.\nOur research and development expenses vary significantly from year to year based on a number of factors, including the timing of new product introductions and the number and nature of our ongoing research and development activities.\nSales, General and Administrative\nSales, general and administrative expenses were comprised primarily of costs associated with our sales and marketing personnel and our executive and administrative personnel (for example, finance, human resources, information technology and legal) and consisted of salaries and related compensation costs; consulting and other professional services (such as litigation and other outside legal counsel fees, audit and other compliance costs); marketing and advertising expenses; facilities and insurance costs; and travel and other costs.

The net losses in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 were primarily due to the planned sale or abandonment of certain long-lived assets to reduce excess manufacturing capacity pursuant to our restructuring plan discussed above.\nWolfspeed Transaction Termination Fee\nAs discussed more fully in Note 1, Business,\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, as a result of the termination of the agreement to sell the Wolfspeed business to Infineon, Infineon paid us a termination fee of $12.5 million in cash on March 10, 2017.\nNon-Operating Income (Expense), net\nThe following table sets forth our non-operating income (expense), net (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-Over-Year Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>June 25, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 26, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 28, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of investments, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($145\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($687\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on equity investment\n</td> <td>7,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,357\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22,624\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(149\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends from equity investment\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,639\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(99\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(926\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net\n</td> <td>3,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(776\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,614\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency gain (loss), net\n</td> <td>2,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,500\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(929\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(155\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,571\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>384\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(257\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(115\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$14,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($13,035\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($10,389\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$27,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(207\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($2,646\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we were in a net interest income position. Our short-term investments consisted primarily of municipal bonds, corporate bonds, U.S. agency securities, non-U.S. certificates of deposit and non-U.S. government securities. The primary objective of our investment policy is preservation of principal. Other long-term investments consisted of our approximately 15% common stock ownership interest in Lextar Electronics Corporation (Lextar), which was completed in December 2014. This investment was accounted for under the equity method from the date of investment until June 2016 when we chose for our representative not to stand for re-election as a member of the Lextar board of directors. We utilize the fair value option in accounting for our investment in Lextar.\nGain on sale of investments, net. Gain on sale of investments, net was $93 thousand, $238 thousand and $925 thousand in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. Gain on sale of investments, net decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower sales of investments. Gain on sale of investments, net decreased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower sales of investments.\nGain (loss) on equity investment. Gain on equity investment was $7.5 million in fiscal 2017 and loss on equity investment was $15.4 million and $22.6 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. We had a gain on equity investment in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in the fair value of our Lextar investment. We had a loss on equity investment in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 due to decreases in the fair value of our Lextar investment. Lextar's stock is publicly traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange and its share price increased from 15.70 New Taiwanese Dollars (TWD) at June 26, 2016 to 18.40 TWD at June 25, 2017. Lextar's share price declined from 30 TWD at the date of our investment in December 2014 to 21.55 TWD at June 28, 2015 and to 15.70 TWD at June 26, 2016. This volatile stock price trend may continue in the future given the risks inherent in Lextar's business and trends affecting the Taiwan and global equity markets. Any future stock price changes will be recorded as further gains or losses on equity investment based on the increase or decrease, respectively, in the fair value of the investment during the applicable fiscal period. Further losses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nDividends from equity investment. Dividends from equity investment were $0.0 million, $1.7 million and $2.6 million in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively, due to our Lextar investment.\nInterest income, net. Interest income, net was $3.7 million, $4.5 million and $9.1 million in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. The decrease in interest income, net in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower invested balances and higher interest expense due to overall higher borrowings associated with our line of credit, partially offset by higher investment yields. The decrease in interest income, net in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower invested balances and higher interest expense due to overall higher borrowings associated with our line of credit, partially offset by higher investment yields.\nForeign currency gain (loss), net. Foreign currency gain (loss), net consisted primarily of remeasurement adjustments resulting from our Lextar investment and consolidating our international subsidiaries. The foreign currency gain, net in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to favorable fluctuations in the exchange rate between both the Chinese Yuan and the Euro and the United States Dollar which was partially offset by an unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the TWD and the United States Dollar related to our Lextar investment. The foreign currency loss, net in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the TWD and the United States Dollar related to our Lextar investment and unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the Chinese Yuan and the United States Dollar. The foreign currency gain, net for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the TWD and the United States Dollar related to our Lextar investment and unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rate between the Euro and the United States Dollar.\nOther, net. Other, net was $200 thousand, $457 thousand and $572 thousand in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nThe following table sets forth our income tax expense (benefit) in dollars and our effective tax rate (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-Over-Year Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>June 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$93,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($1,970\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($19,247\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,844\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>(2,004\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognized income tax expense of $93.5 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to income tax benefit of $2.0 million in fiscal 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 8% in fiscal 2016 to (2,004)% in fiscal 2017 was due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets and other deferred charges in a period of a pre-tax loss, as discussed more fully in Note 12 Income Taxes\u201d to our audited financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 23% in fiscal 2015 to 8% in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on foreign net operating loss carryovers during fiscal 2016.\nThe variation between our effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent is due to: (i) changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Luxembourg, (ii) income derived from international locations with lower tax rates than the U.S., and (iii) tax credits generated.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including outlays for research and development, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, marketable securities, cash generated from operations and availability under our line of credit. Our ability to generate cash from operations has been one of our fundamental strengths and has provided us with substantial flexibility in meeting our operating, financing and investing needs. We have a $500 million line of credit as discussed in Note 8, Long-term Debt,\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. The purpose of this facility is to provide short term flexibility to optimize returns on our cash and investment portfolio while funding share repurchases, capital expenditures and other general business needs.\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our current working capital, availability under our line of credit and anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. We may use a portion of our available cash and cash equivalents, line of credit or funds underlying our marketable securities to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors. With our strong working capital position, we believe that we have the ability to continue to invest in further development of our products and, when necessary or appropriate, make selective acquisitions or other strategic investments to strengthen our product portfolio, secure key intellectual properties or expand our production capacity.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, spin-offs or investments in complementary businesses, and we anticipate continuing to make such evaluations. We may also access capital markets through the issuance of debt or additional shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of complementary businesses or other significant assets or for other strategic opportunities.\nContractual Obligations\nAt June 25, 2017, payments to be made pursuant to significant contractual obligations are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One to\nThree Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three to\nFive Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\nFive Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$14,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$4,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$6,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>124,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>145,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on long-term debt1\n</td> <td>11,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities2\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$295,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$119,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$161,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$8,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1Interest payments on long-term debt are based on the interest rate at June 25, 2017.\n2 Other long-term liabilities as of June 25, 2017 included long-term tax contingencies and other tax liabilities of $49.9 million, deferred liabilities of $0.4 million and other long-term contingent liabilities (for example, warranties) of $19.8 million. These liabilities were not included in the table above as they will either not be settled in cash and/or the timing of any payments is uncertain.\nOperating lease obligations include rental amounts due on leases of certain office and manufacturing space under the terms of non-cancelable operating leases. These leases expire at various times through April 2024. Most of the lease agreements provide for rental adjustments for increases in base rent, property taxes and general property maintenance that would be recognized as rent expense, if applicable.\nPurchase obligations represent purchase commitments, including open purchase orders and contracts, and are generally related to the purchase of goods and services in the ordinary course of business such as raw materials, supplies and capital equipment.\nFinancial Condition\nThe following table sets forth our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (in thousands):\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>June 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$132,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$166,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($33,557\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments\n</td> <td>478,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$610,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$605,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur liquidity and capital resources primarily depend on our cash flows from operations and our working capital.

DSO is based on the ending net trade receivables and the revenue, net for the quarter then ended. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of applicable allowances and reserves, by the average net revenue per day for the respective 90 day period. \n b) Days of supply in inventory (DSI) measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DSI is based on ending inventory and cost of revenue, net for the quarter then ended. DSI is calculated by dividing ending inventory by average cost of revenue, net per day for the respective 90 day period. \n c) Days in accounts payable (DPO) measures the average number of days our payables remain outstanding before payment. DPO is based on ending accounts payable and cost of revenue, net for the quarter then ended. DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by the average cost of revenue, net per day for the respective 90 day period.  The decrease in the cash conversion cycle was primarily driven by an increase in days in accounts payable and decreases in days of sales outstanding and in days of supply in inventory.\nAs of June 25, 2017, we had unrealized losses on our investments of $0.3 million. All of our investments had investment grade ratings, and any such investments that were in an unrealized loss position at June 25, 2017 were in such position due to interest rate changes, sector credit rating changes or company-specific rating changes. As we intend and believe that we have the ability to hold such investments for a period of time that will be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value, we currently expect to receive the full principal or recover our cost basis in these securities. The declines in value of the securities in our portfolio are considered to be temporary in nature and, accordingly, we do not believe these securities are impaired as of June 25, 2017.\nCash Flows\nIn summary, our cash flows were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-Over-Year Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>June 25, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 26, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 28, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$215,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$203,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$181,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$12,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$22,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(145,250\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,903\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,137\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(137,347\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(104,078\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(167,859\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(311,353\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign exchange changes\n</td> <td>(129\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,110\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(878\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(232\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($33,557\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$26,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($147,114\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($60,001\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$173,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following is a discussion of our primary sources and uses of cash in our operating, investing and financing activities.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased to $215.9 million in fiscal 2017 from $203.3 million in fiscal 2016, primarily due to cash generated from working capital, partially offset by a higher net loss in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $203.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $181.3 million in fiscal 2015, primarily due to a lower net loss in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur investing activities primarily relate to transactions within our short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment and payments for patents and licensing rights. Net cash used in investing activities was $145.3 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $7.9 million in fiscal 2016. Purchases of property, equipment and patent rights decreased by $35.1 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Net purchases of short-term investments increased $181.1 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. This year over year increase was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the sale and maturities of short-term investments, partially offset by a decrease in short-term investment purchase activity. Fiscal 2016 included $12.5 million in net expenditures to acquire APEI.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $7.9 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $16.1 million in fiscal 2015. Purchases of property, equipment and patent rights decreased by $91.2 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Net proceeds from the sale of short-term investments decreased $156 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. This year over year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the sale and maturities of short-term investments, partially offset by a decrease in short-term investment purchase activity. Fiscal 2016 included $12.5 million in net expenditures to acquire APEI while fiscal 2015 included the $80.6 million investment in Lextar.\nFor fiscal 2018, we target approximately $220 million of capital investment, which is primarily related to infrastructure projects to support our longer term growth and strategic priorities.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $104.1 million in fiscal 2017 compared to net cash used by financing activities of $167.9 million in fiscal 2016. Our financing activities for fiscal 2017 primarily consisted of repurchases of common stock of $104.0 million and net payments on long-term debt borrowings of $15.0 million on our line of credit, partially offset by proceeds of $17.7 million from net issuances of common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, including the excess tax benefit on those exercises. Fiscal 2017 included payment of $2.8 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration related to our fiscal 2016 acquisition of APEI.\nIn fiscal 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $167.9 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $311.4 million in fiscal 2015. Our financing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily consisted of repurchases of common stock of $149.6 million and net payments on long-term borrowings of $40.0 million on our line of credit, partially offset by proceeds of $21.7 million from net issuances of common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, including the excess tax benefit on those exercises.\nOn August 24, 2016, the Board of Directors approved our fiscal 2017 stock repurchase program, authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock having an aggregate purchase price not exceeding $300 million for all purchases from August 24, 2016 through the expiration of the program on June 25, 2017.\nOn June 14, 2017, the Board of Directors approved our fiscal 2018 stock repurchase program, authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock having an aggregate purchase price not exceeding $200 million for all purchases from June 26, 2017 through the expiration of the program on June 24, 2018. Since the inception of our stock repurchase program in 2001, we have repurchased 38.7 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $28.66 per share with an aggregate value of $1.1 billion. The repurchase program may be implemented through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of our management.\nFair Value\nUnder U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches, including quoted market prices and discounted cash flows. U.S. GAAP also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:\n \u2022 Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that we are able to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment. \n \u2022 Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for instruments that are similar, or quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar instruments, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. \n \u2022 Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.  The financial assets for which we perform recurring fair value remeasurements are cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of June 25, 2017, financial assets utilizing Level 1 inputs included money market funds. Financial assets utilizing Level 2 inputs included municipal bonds, corporate bonds, non-U.S. certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and common stock of non-U.S. corporations. Level 2 assets are valued using a third-party pricing service's consensus price which is a weighted average price based on multiple sources. These sources determine prices utilizing market income models which factor in, where applicable, transactions of similar assets in active markets, transactions of identical assets in infrequent markets, interest rates, bond or credit default swap spreads and volatility. We do not have any financial assets requiring the use of Level 3 inputs. Please refer to Note 6, Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information.\nFinancial and Market Risks\nWe are exposed to financial and market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodities risk. We have entered and may in the future enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments in an effort to manage or hedge some of our foreign exchange rate risk. We may not be able to engage in hedging transactions in the future, and even if we do, foreign currency fluctuations may still have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial performance. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial positions at June 25, 2017 and June 26, 2016. Actual results may differ materially.\nInterest Rates\nWe maintain an investment portfolio principally composed of money market funds, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. In order to minimize risk, our cash management policy permits us to acquire investments rated A\u201d grade or better. As of June 25, 2017 and June 26, 2016, our cash equivalents and short-term investments had a fair value of $482.1 million and $439.9 million, respectively. If interest rates were to hypothetically increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of our cash equivalents and short-term"}
