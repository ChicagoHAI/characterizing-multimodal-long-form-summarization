Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited, to those described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and elsewhere. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are the second largest specialty distributor of wallboard and suspended ceiling systems in the United States and Canada, and the fastest growing by sales and branch count since our founding in 2011. We are also the second largest specialty distributor and one of the largest fabricators of commercial and industrial mechanical insulation in the United States. We have expanded from a single branch in Southern California to over 200 branches across North America, carrying a broad array of more than 35,000 SKUs. We have grown sales faster than any U.S. publicly traded building products distributor over the same period. Our goal is to be the leading company within specialty building products distribution and to continue expanding into complementary markets.\nWe were founded in 2011 by our President and Chief Executive Officer Ruben Mendoza, our Chief Financial Officer John Gorey and one of our Regional Vice Presidents, Tom Fischbeck. Mr. Mendoza previously served as CEO of Acoustical Material Services where he oversaw the successful growth of the company before it was acquired by Allied Building Products in 2007. In founding our company, Mr. Mendoza applied a proven customer-centric operating model to an organization that would combine strong organic growth with an effective acquisition and integration program across a fragmented industry, where he and other members of management had long and close personal relationships with many private acquisition candidates in our industry. In our early years we were focused on opening or acquiring new branches to leverage our founders' customer focus and strong supplier relationships. In 2012 and 2013, we began rapidly growing through both organic growth and acquisitions, and by the end of 2013, we significantly increased our number of branches and geographic footprint, and expanded from California into the Midwest, Florida and Arizona. This rapid growth resulted in the acquisition of our current ERP platform and information technology structure and added a deep bench of leaders from the acquired companies to prepare for future growth. In addition, in November 2013, we strengthened our management team with the addition of our Chief Operating Officer Pete Welly, who has over 35 years of experience in our industry.\nIn 2014 and 2015, we expanded into Texas through three acquisitions, and acquired branches in Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania. We also increased our market position in California and Arizona with wallboard and metal framing customers. These acquisitions further strengthened our relationship with key suppliers such as Armstrong and USG. Our nationwide presence, as well as our ability to achieve operating efficiencies while leveraging a national purchasing platform, led to favorable margin improvement.\nIn August 2016, we entered the Canadian market through our acquisition of Winroc-SPI for cash consideration of $314.1 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments, which increased our sales and expanded our relationship with Armstrong. Winroc-SPI's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $745.3 million. We also became the second largest specialty distributor and one of the largest fabricators of commercial and industrial mechanical insulation in the United States. The expansion into commercial and industrial insulation products both diversified our customer base and allowed us to capitalize on some of the strengths of our proven operating model given that wallboard distributors and commercial and industrial insulation distributors have similar business models. The Winroc-SPI acquisition strategically opened new markets in both the United States and Canada, added the industry-leading suspended ceiling systems line in additional geographies, and broadened our product offering in many U.S. markets.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn February 15, 2017, we completed our initial public offering of 12,800,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $14.00 per share. Our common stock began trading on the NYSE on February 10, 2017 under the ticker symbol \"FBM\". After underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses payable by us, net proceeds from the IPO were $164.0 million. We used these proceeds to repay borrowings outstanding under our ABL Credit Facility.\nDescription of Segments\nWe have two reportable segments. Resources are allocated and performance is assessed by our CEO, whom we have determined to be our Chief Operating Decision Maker, or CODM. Management evaluates performance for each segment based on gross profit. The reportable segments are described below.\nSpecialty Building Products\nSpecialty building products, or SBP, distributes wallboard, metal framing, suspended ceiling systems and complementary and other products. Complementary and other products include wallboard accessories, stucco and exterior insulation and finish systems, or EIFS, as well as other offerings, such as tools, safety accessories and fasteners. The primary end markets served are new non-residential, new residential and non-residential repair and remodel construction markets.\nMechanical Insulation\nMechanical insulation, or MI, includes insulation solutions for pipes and mechanical systems and the primary end markets served are new non-residential construction, non-residential repair and remodel construction and industrial markets.\nFactors and Trends Affecting Our Business and Results of Operations\nGeneral Economic Conditions and Outlook\nDemand for our products is impacted by changes in general economic conditions, including, in particular, conditions in the U.S. commercial construction and housing markets. Our end markets are broadly categorized as new non-residential construction, new residential construction, non-residential repair and remodel construction and industrial. We believe each of our end markets is currently in an extended period of recovery following a deep and prolonged recession.\nNew Non-Residential Construction\nNon-residential construction encompasses all construction other than residential structures. Non-residential construction growth is primarily influenced by economic growth, business investment, job growth, vacancy rates and availability and cost of capital. Based on U.S. Census Bureau data, growth in commercial construction spending generally lags new residential spending by approximately 18 months and we believe the commercial construction market remains in the early stages of a recovery. According to Dodge Data & Analytics, non-residential construction starts were 1,112 million square feet in 2017 and would need to increase by 22.6% to achieve the historical annual market average. Given the recent growth in the residential market, management believes that non-residential construction remains in the early stages of its recovery and expects volumes to gain momentum in the coming years in areas such as retail, lodging and healthcare. According to Dodge Data & Analytics, non-residential construction starts are expected to grow at approximately a compound annual growth rate of 4.6% from 2017 to 2019.\nNew Residential Construction\nJob growth is an important factor for a healthy housing market and unemployment has fallen from its peak of 10.0% in 2009 to 4.1% as of December 2017 according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, total housing starts in 2017 were 1.2 million. While housing starts have significantly recovered from the 0.55 million seen in 2009, they are still 17.3% below the 50-year average of 1.4 million starts per year. National housing affordability has led to higher household formation rates that are up after years of being below the historical trend line.\nNon-Residential Repair and Remodel Construction\nNon-residential repair and remodeling spending tends to be resilient through economic downturns as new construction spending slows and investments in existing infrastructure increase. From 2013 to 2017 non-residential repair and remodeling starts grew at a 6.7% CAGR and are expected to continue to grow at a 3.5% annual growth rate through 2018 according to Dodge Data & Analytics. The Architectural Billings index also forecasts continued growth, and public construction spending is anticipated to be up modestly in 2018.\nIndustrial\nIndustrial end markets represent a portion of the U.S. mechanical insulation market. Commercial and industrial insulation products are used in industrial end markets for piping and ducting in facilities. Industrial production is expected to be strong in 2018, while higher energy prices support MRO spending. Management estimates that power generation facilities make up the largest component of the industrial end market. Stable demand for insulation is expected as power generators construct new facilities and expand old ones.\nVolume, Costs and Pricing Programs\nOur product costs are directly impacted by fluctuations in supplier pricing and our purchasing volume. As one of the leading wallboard, suspended ceiling systems and commercial and industrial insulation distributors in the United States and Canada, we are able to negotiate volume discounts and favorable pricing terms with our suppliers. We have historically realized purchasing synergies almost immediately after an acquisition by taking advantage of our volume discounts. As we have continued to grow, we have negotiated with our suppliers on a national level in an effort to maximize these programs across our entire branch network, and expect to continue this trend in the future.\nAcquisitions\nWe supplement our organic growth strategy with selective acquisitions, and during the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed 10 acquisitions totaling 19 branches. See Note 3, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that significant opportunities exist to continue to expand our geographic footprint and product offerings by executing additional strategic acquisitions, and we maintain an extensive and active acquisition pipeline. We are typically evaluating several acquisition opportunities at any given time. In executing our acquisition strategy and integrating acquired companies, we focus on the cost savings we can achieve through integrated procurement and pricing programs and brand consolidation. The 10 acquisitions completed in 2017 contributed approximately $78.4 million of net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. As of February 26, 2018, all of the acquisitions made through December 31, 2017 have been fully integrated.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effective Date of Acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Branch Locations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td># of Branches Acquired\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Del-Pro Building Supplies, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ontario, Canada\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MCS Door & Hardware\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>American Wal-Board, LLC, American Materials, LLC, American Drywall & Roofing, LLC and JLS Equipment Leasing, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>TN, MS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceiling and Wall Supply, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MO, IL, KY\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Virginia Builders' Supply, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>VA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wallboard, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gypsum Wallboard Supply, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>WA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trident Distribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>GA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Irwin Builders Supply Corporation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 3, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dominion Interior Supply Corporation and Dominion Interior Supply of Roanoke LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 3, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>VA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs part of our accounting for business combinations, we are required to value inventory acquired in the business combination at its net realizable value. The inventory adjustment is typically fully recognized in cost of goods sold within the first month after completion of an acquisition. This step-up in basis and related expense has a negative effect on margins as the related inventory is sold. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, the period from October 9, 2015 to December 31, 2015 and the period from January 1, 2015 to October 8, 2015, the impact of the acquired step-up in inventory basis to cost of goods sold was $0.8 million, $6.5 million, $7.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively.\nSeasonality\nOur operating results are typically affected by seasonality. Warmer and drier weather during the second and third quarters typically result in higher activity and sales levels. The first and fourth quarters typically have lower levels of activity and lower working capital requirements due to inclement weather conditions.\nBasis of Presentation\nOn October 9, 2015, Lone Star, along with certain members of management, acquired 100% of the outstanding equity of FBM Intermediate Holdings LLC in the Lone Star Acquisition.\nThe period from January 1, 2015 through October 8, 2015 and the period from October 9, 2015 through December 31, 2015 relate, respectively, to the periods in 2015 preceding and succeeding completion of the Lone Star Acquisition. The terms Predecessor and Successor refer to the pre- and post-Lone Star Acquisition financial position and results of the Company, respectively. Due to the Lone Star Acquisition, the basis of accounting changed and reflects the application of the acquisition method. The new basis of accounting primarily impacted the values of our inventory, long-lived assets and intangible assets, and resulted in increased depreciation and amortization.\nResults of

SBP net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $1,790.1 million compared to $1,293.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $496.6 million, or 38.4%. Net sales from acquired branches and existing branches that were strategically combined with acquired branches contributed $452.2 million of the increase, primarily due to the acquisition of Winroc-SPI in August 2016. SBP base business net sales also increased by $44.4 million due to product expansion into new markets and the overall market growth in both the commercial and residential construction markets. The drivers for the increases in net sales of the SBP product categories are consistent with the drivers for consolidated net sales.\nMechanical Insulation. MI net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $270.8 million compared to $99.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. We entered the mechanical insulation market as a result of the Winroc-SPI acquisition on August 9, 2016; therefore, there was a shorter period of sales in this segment during the prior year period.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nConsolidated gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $597.9 million compared to $396.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $201.1 million, or 50.7%. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in sales volume and contributions from acquisitions. Gross profit from our base business contributed $17.8 million of the increase reflecting a 0.6% margin improvement over the prior year and gross profit from acquired businesses contributed the remaining $183.3 million of the increase reflecting a 1.0% margin improvement. Consolidated gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 29.0% compared to 28.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a $0.8 million charge for inventory fair value purchase accounting adjustments as compared to $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the effect of these adjustments, gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 29.0% for both years.\nSpecialty Building Products. SBP gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $522.2 million compared to $371.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $150.5 million, or 40.5%. SBP gross profit increased with higher sales volume from both acquisitions and base business growth. Gross profit from our base business contributed $17.8 million of the increase reflecting a 0.6% margin improvement over the prior year and gross profit from acquired businesses contributed the remaining $132.7 million of the increase reflecting a 0.8% margin improvement. SBP gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 29.2% compared to 28.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016. SBP gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a $0.7 million charge for inventory fair value purchase accounting adjustments as compared to $4.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the effect of these adjustments, SBP gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 29.2% as compared to 29.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the effect of the inventory fair value purchase accounting adjustments, the increase in SBP gross margin was primarily due to continued pricing discipline across markets we serve.\nMechanical Insulation. MI gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $75.7 million compared to $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $50.6 million, or 201.6%. MI gross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the timing of the Winroc-SPI acquisition in August 2016 and not realizing a full year ended of results in the prior year. MI gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 27.9% compared to 25.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016. MI gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a $0.1 million charge for inventory fair value purchase accounting adjustments as compared to $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the effect of these adjustments, MI gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 28.0% as compared to 27.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in MI gross margin, excluding the effect of the inventory fair value purchase accounting adjustments, was primarily due to operational efficiencies.\nSelling, General & Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses consist of warehouse, delivery and general and administrative expenses. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $461.6 million compared to $328.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $132.7 million, or 40.4%. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 22.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower transaction costs and improved operating efficiencies.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $76.9 million compared to $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $25.5 million, or 49.6%. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the Winroc-SPI acquisition in August 2016, which significantly increased the value of property and equipment and intangible assets subject to depreciation and amortization.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $61.1 million compared to $52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $8.6 million, or 16.3%. The increase in interest expense is due to the senior secured notes, or the Notes, issued for the Winroc-SPI acquisition being outstanding for the full year.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $81.5 million compared to an expense of $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to a reduction in our Tax Receivable Agreement, or TRA, liability of $68.0 million and the change in fair value of the embedded derivative of $13.2 million, which represents an early prepayment option of our Notes due 2021. See Note 19, Tax Receivable Agreement, and Note 8, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate for years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were (3.3%) and 34.2%, respectively. Our tax rates are affected by recurring items, such as non-deductible transaction costs and varying tax rates between the United States and Canada. They are also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year. In addition to state income taxes, the items that had the most significant impact on the difference between our statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% and our effective tax rate were the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% in the 2017 tax reform legislation, which both significantly reduced our liability under the TRA with our majority stockholder, which resulted in a $68.0 million gain on the write down of the liability that was treated as a non-taxable permanent item and resulted in a 29.8% benefit to the overall effective rate, and the write down of the period-ending deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2017, which resulted in a provisional $9.1 million credit to income tax that gave rise to a provisional 11.4% benefit to the overall effective tax rate. In 2016, non-deductible IPO and acquisition related expenses of $1.5 million resulted in a 3.4% increase to the overall effective tax rate.

The effective tax rate for the period was 37.4%, which differs from the statutory rate primarily due to state taxes.\nPeriod from January 1, 2015 to October 8, 2015 (Predecessor)\nThe following table summarizes certain financial information relating to our operating results for the period from January 1, 2015 to October 8, 2015:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>January 1, 2015\nto October 8,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statements of operations data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>628,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>452,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>175,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>171,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>15,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>186,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>(11,673\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(19,090\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(30,749\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>(1,294\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29,455\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales\nNet sales were $628.1 million, all from the SBP segment, which primarily consisted of wallboard and accessories.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold was $452.9 million, which included $1.6 million of inventory fair value adjustments, and resulted in gross profit of $175.2 million, or gross margin of 27.9%. Excluding inventory fair value adjustments, gross margin was 28.1%.\nSelling, General & Administrative\nSG&A expenses were $171.2 million and represented 27.3% of net sales. Acquisition related expenses were $39.7 million and represents acquisition activity including the Lone Star Acquisition.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $15.6 million, and represented 2.5% of net sales. Depreciation and amortization includes the impact of the addition of property and equipment and intangible assets acquired.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $19.1 million as a result of our outstanding indebtedness.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit was $1.3 million and reflected the fact that we had subsidiaries that were either nontaxable limited liability companies or taxable C-corporations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSummary\nWe depend on cash flow from operations, cash on hand and funds available under our ABL Credit Facility, and in the future may depend on other debt financings allowed under the terms of the Indenture and ABL Credit Agreement and equity financings, to finance our acquisition strategy, working capital needs and capital expenditures. We believe that these sources of funds will be adequate to fund debt service requirements and provide cash, as required, to support our strategy, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, lease obligations and working capital for at least the next twelve months. However, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain future debt or equity financings adequate for our future cash requirements on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The tax receivable agreement may also have a negative impact on our liquidity if, among other things, payments we make under the tax receivable agreement exceed the actual cash savings we and our subsidiaries realize in respect of the tax benefits covered by the tax receivable agreement after we have paid our taxes and other obligations. In addition, as a result of either an early termination of the tax receivable agreement or a change of control, we could be required to make payments under the agreement that exceed our actual cash savings under the tax receivable agreement. In these situations, our obligations under the tax receivable agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing, among other things, capital expenditures and acquisitions.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay additional acquisitions, future investments and capital expenditures, seek additional capital, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, or sell assets. Significant delays in our ability to finance planned acquisitions or capital expenditures may materially and adversely affect our future sales prospects. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the Notes and our ABL Credit Facility, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Our tax receivable agreement requires that, after Lone Star no longer controls us, any senior debt document that refinances or replaces our existing indebtedness permit our subsidiaries to make dividends to us, without any conditions, to the extent required for us to make its payments under the tax receivable agreement, unless Lone Star otherwise consents. At the time of any such refinancing, it may not be possible to include this term in such senior debt documents, and as a result, we may need Lone Star's consent to complete such refinancing. The ABL Credit Agreement and the Indenture restrict our ability to enter into certain asset sales transactions. We may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair, and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had available aggregate undrawn borrowing capacity of approximately $252.5 million under the ABL Credit Facility. For the periods presented, our use of cash was primarily driven by our investing activities, specifically our investments in acquisitions.\nCash Flows\nA summary of net cash provided by, or used in, operating, investing and financing activities is shown in the following table.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 9, 2015\nto\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>January 1, 2015\nto\nOctober 8, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(96,938\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(431,805\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(660,323\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(97,266\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>416,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>642,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes and the effects of changes in working capital.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $44.2 million to $77.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $33.1 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net income of $110.9 million, higher depreciation and amortization of $25.5 million due to an increase in fixed assets and intangibles as a result of acquisitions, higher amortization of debt issuance costs of $4.0 million related to higher levels of debt as a result of acquisitions and changes in deferred income taxes of $11.6 million due to new tax legislation, partially offset by a reduction in the TRA liability of $68.0 million due to new tax legislation, higher working capital expenditures of $9.9 million, increased unrealized gains related to the change in fair value of our derivatives of $20.0 million, lower inventory fair value adjustments of $5.7 million due to the lower value of acquisitions and lower losses on the extinguishment of debt of $5.4 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, consisted of a net loss of $28.4 million, offset by non-cash items of $61.8 million of which $51.4 million was depreciation and amortization. Cash used for working capital was $0.3 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the period from October 9, 2015 to December 31, 2015, consisted of a net loss of $7.9 million, offset by non-cash items of $22.4 million, of which $7.2 million was depreciation and amortization, $7.5 million related to fair value inventory adjustments and $6.5 million related to deferred taxes. Cash provided by working capital was $3.2 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the period from January 1, 2015 to October 8, 2015, consisted of a net loss of $29.5 million, partially offset by non-cash items of $20.5 million, of which $15.6 million was depreciation and amortization. Cash provided by working capital was $28.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities consists primarily of acquisitions and capital expenditures, including purchases of land, buildings, leasehold improvements, fleet assets, information technology and other equipment. Capital expenditures vary depending on prevailing business factors, including current and anticipated market conditions. Historically, capital expenditures generally have been made at relatively low levels in comparison to the operating cash flows generated during the corresponding periods.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $334.9 million to $96.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $431.8 million in the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a lower aggregate purchase price of acquisitions of $324.0 million and net proceeds related to net working capital adjustments from acquisitions of $8.2 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $431.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we acquired Winroc-SPI, Ken Builder Supply, Inc., or Ken API, Kent Gypsum Supply, Co., Mid America Drywall Supply, Inc. and United Drywall Supply for aggregate consideration of $401.9 million. Cash used for capital expenditures was $30.5 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the 2015 Successor period was $660.3 million and primarily related to $549.3 million used in the Lone Star Acquisition and $103.2 million to acquire Gypsum Supply Co., or GSCIL. Cash used for capital expenditures was $2.8 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the 2015 Predecessor period was $97.3 million and primarily related to $87.5 million used to acquire Oxnard Building Materials, Inc., Great Western Building Materials, Inc. and ProWall Building Products, Inc. (collectively, \"Great Western\"). Cash used for capital expenditures was $9.8 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by, or used in, financing activities consists primarily of borrowings and related repayments under our financing agreements and proceeds from capital contributions.\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $413.8 million to $2.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $416.7 million in the same period in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, IPO proceeds of $164.0 million were used for debt repayments, compared to net borrowings of $350.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $416.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net borrowings of $350.5 million and capital contributions of $66.2 million were used to finance the acquisitions made in 2016 and fund operations.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the 2015 Successor period was $642.7 million, and primarily consisted of net borrowings of $379.8 million to finance the Lone Star Acquisition and capital contributions of $272.9 million, offset by $10.0 million in debt repayments.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the 2015 Predecessor period was $86.6 million was primarily due to financing related to the Great Western acquisition.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017. Some of the amounts included in the table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, our actual payments may vary from those reflected in the table.\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>575,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>575,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TRA liability(1)\n</td> <td>15,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>47,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>33,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>3,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Commitments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>650,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,038,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) The TRA liability at December 31, 2017 was $135.8 million. The first payment in the amount of $15.9 million under the TRA will be made in the fourth quarter of 2018 based on the Company's 2017 tax returns. Payments related to the TRA are expected to be funded through one, or a combination of the following: existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, or availability under the ABL Credit Agreement. The discounted present value of the TRA at December 31, 2017, was estimated to be between $85.0 million and $95.0 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe lease certain facilities and equipment under various operating lease agreements with expiration dates through 2026. These lease agreements typically contain renewal options of five to ten years. Additionally, with the acquisitions of Winroc-SPI and Ken API in 2016, we assumed capital lease obligations with lease terms ranging from five to 15 years.\nABL Credit Facility\nOn August 9, 2016, we entered into the ABL Credit Agreement providing for the ABL Credit Facility, a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, and on September 23, 2016, we entered into an incremental facility amendment to the ABL Credit Facility, increasing the size of the revolving commitments thereunder by $50.0 million. The ABL Credit Facility provides for a $300.0 million revolving credit facility and matures on February 9, 2021. The ABL Credit Facility includes an option to further increase the maximum commitments up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (i) $50.0 million and (ii) such amount as would not cause the total revolving credit commitments under the ABL Credit Facility to exceed the aggregate borrowing base under the ABL Credit Facility by more than $50.0 million, in each case as of the date of such incurrence, subject to the conditions set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement.\nInterest on borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility accrues at a rate equal to LIBOR or Canadian Dollar Offered Rate, or CDOR (as applicable, based on the currency of the borrowing), plus a margin of 1.25% to 1.75% based on average daily excess availability for the most recent fiscal quarter, or if selected by the borrower, ABR or the Canadian prime rate (as applicable, based on the currency of the borrowings) plus a margin of 0.25% to 0.75% based on average daily excess availability for the most recent fiscal quarter, in all such cases subject to an additional 2.0% on overdue amounts during certain default events.\nThe ABL Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, representations and warranties and events of default, including covenants which generally restrict our business and limit our ability to, among other things: dispose of certain assets; incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; enter into new lines of business; make certain investments, intercompany loans or payments in respect of indebtedness; incur or maintain liens; modify certain terms of our or their organizational documents, certain agreements or certain debt instruments; declare or pay dividends or make other restricted payments (including redemption of our stock); engage in certain transactions with affiliates; enter into certain sale leaseback transactions; modify the terms of certain of our existing contractual agreements; and engage in mergers, consolidations or the sale or disposition of substantially all of its assets. The ABL Credit Agreement also includes representations and warranties which we must be able to make in order to obtain borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility, and a financial maintenance covenant and events of default related to, among other things: the non-payment of principal, interest or fees; violations of covenants; material inaccuracy of representations or warranties; failure to timely deliver a borrowing base certificate; certain bankruptcy events; certain events under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; invalidity of guarantees or security interests; default in payment under or the acceleration of other indebtedness; material judgments; and certain change of control events, each of which could result in the facility being terminated and any outstanding debt becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity. The financial maintenance covenant under the ABL Credit Agreement is a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test set at a level of 1.00:1.00, which is based in part on our adjusted EBITDA as calculated pursuant to the ABL Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2017, the fixed charge coverage ratio exceeded the minimum requirement. This covenant is only tested at times when availability under the ABL Credit Facility is less than a certain threshold, which was $30.0 million at December 31, 2017. We were in compliance with all covenants under the ABL Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the majority of our liquidity was from the $252.5 million available under the ABL Credit Facility. The fixed charge coverage ratio is a material term of the ABL Credit Agreement and we believe information about how the covenant is calculated is material to an investor's understanding of the Company's financial condition and liquidity.\nShould we not comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio, we would be in technical default of our ABL Credit Facility which could result in the facility being terminated and any outstanding debt becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity. Should all amounts become due immediately, we may be unable to pay all amounts due under the ABL Credit Facility without a material impact to our business, as we may be forced to liquidate assets to pay for all amounts due under the ABL Credit Facility.\nNotes\nIn August 2016, we completed a private offering of $575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. In the offering we received net proceeds of approximately $563.5 million, which were used in part to repay and terminate the 2015 Credit Facility. The Notes carry a coupon of 8.25% per annum and mature August 15, 2021. The Indenture contains customary covenants, representations and warranties and events of default, including covenants which generally restrict our business and limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, issue certain preferred shares, pay dividends, redeem our stock or make other distributions, make certain investments, limit the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to us or make other intercompany transfers, create liens, sell or transfer certain assets, engage in certain transactions with respect to all or substantially all of our assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates and designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. The Indenture also contains events of default related to, among other things: the non-payment of principal, premium or interest on any Note; violations of any agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture and related documents; certain bankruptcy events; invalidity of guarantees or security interests; default in payment under or the acceleration of other indebtedness; and material judgments, any of which could result in the trustee for the Notes declaring the principal of the Notes together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon to be immediately due and payable. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Indenture as of December 31, 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements or similar obligations, such as financing or unconsolidated variable interest entities.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reported period.\nOn an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates that are more susceptible to change in the near term are the allowance for doubtful accounts, the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory and recoverability of long-lived assets. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when the risks and obligations of ownership have been transferred to the customer, which generally occurs at the time of delivery to the customer. At the time that revenue is recognized we record reductions in sales for customer rebates and discounts including volume, cash and other discounts. Rebates and discounts are recorded based on management's best estimate when products are sold based on historical experience for similar programs and products. Management reviews these rebates and discounts on an ongoing basis and the related accruals are adjusted, if necessary, as additional information becomes available. Historically, our actual customer rebates and discounts have not been materially different from management's original estimates.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe sell to customers using credit terms customary in our industry. Accounts receivables are recorded at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our estimate of credit exposure, determined principally on the basis of our collection experience, aging of our receivables and significant individual account credit risk. If the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance, our operating results would be significantly adversely affected.\nOther Receivables\nOther receivables primarily consist of vendor rebates receivables. Typical arrangements with vendors provide for us to receive a rebate of a specified amount after achieving any of a number of measures generally related to the volume of purchases over a period of time. We record these rebates to effectively reduce the cost of sales in the period in which the product is sold. Throughout the year, our estimates include the amount of rebates receivable for the vendor programs based on the expected level of purchases. We accrue for vendor rebates earned based on purchase volumes and adjust inventories to reflect the reduction in the cost basis for inventories purchased that are subject to vendor rebates. Historically, our actual vendor rebates have not been materially different from management's original estimates.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting substantially of finished goods, are valued at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value). Cost is determined using the moving weighted-average cost method. We routinely evaluate inventory for excess or obsolescence and consider factors such as historical usage and purchase rates and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory. If we determine that a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate, we will record a credit or a charge to cost of sales in the period in which we make such a determination.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review property and equipment for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends. In performing the review for recoverability, future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are estimated. If the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. We use our best judgment based on current facts and circumstances related to its business when making these estimates.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nIntangible assets consist of tradenames, customer relationships and favorable and unfavorable leases under market rent, and are amortized using the straight-line method, which reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. For favorable and unfavorable leases under market rent, amounts are amortized over their contractual terms.\nWe review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset are estimated. If the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value.\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.\nWe perform our impairment test annually at the reporting unit level or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We have defined our reporting units consistently with our operating segments. For our goodwill impairment assessment we have adopted a standard that provides us the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (greater than 50 percent chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Such qualitative factors may include the following: macroeconomic conditions; industry and market considerations; cost factors; overall financial performance; consistency of customer base; and other relevant entity-specific events. In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, goodwill impairment is determined utilizing a two-step process. This process involves comparing the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill. We determine the fair value of its reporting units using combinations of both the income and market valuation approaches.\nDuring 2017, we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill, which did not indicate that an impairment existed.\nAcquisition Accounting\nWe account for business combinations using the purchase method, which requires us to allocate the cost of an acquired business to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize the excess of an acquired business's cost over the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities as goodwill. Determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We use a variety of information sources to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities and we generally use third party appraisers to assist us in the determination of the fair value and useful lives of identifiable intangible assets.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we recognize income tax expense for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our uncertain tax positions. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could cause our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes to be inaccurate. Changes in any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. Our tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. As the calendar year progresses, we periodically refine our estimate based on actual events and earnings by jurisdiction. This ongoing estimation process can result in changes to our expected effective tax rate for the full calendar year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that our year-to-date provision equals our expected annual effective tax rate.\nRecently Adopted and issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to our results under GAAP, we also present Adjusted EBITDA for historical periods. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and has been presented as a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We calculate EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax benefit (expense), depreciation and amortization. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before unrealized (gains) losses on derivative financial instruments, IPO and public company readiness expenses, stock-based compensation, non-recurring adjustments such as non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, losses on the disposal of property and equipment, hurricane related costs, transaction costs, management fees and changes in the value of the TRA liability.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because they are important metrics used by management as one of the means by which it assesses our financial performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. These measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, provide investors with an additional financial analytical framework that may be useful in assessing our Company and its results of operations.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have certain limitations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), or as any other measures of financial performance derived in accordance with GAAP. These measures also should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items for which these non-GAAP measures make adjustments. Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be liquidity measures because of certain limitations such as:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>They do not reflect our cash outlays for capital expenditures or future contractual commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>They do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>They do not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on indebtedness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>They do not reflect income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and these non-GAAP measures do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther companies, including other companies in our industry, may not use the measures or may calculate one or both differently than as presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.\nIn evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments made in our calculations, and our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to mean that our future results will be unaffected by such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental financial metrics and in conjunction with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the nearest GAAP measure, net income (loss):\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited, to those described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and elsewhere. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are the second largest specialty distributor of wallboard and suspended ceiling systems in the United States and Canada, and the fastest growing by sales and branch count since our founding in 2011. We are also the second largest specialty distributor and one of the largest fabricators of commercial and industrial mechanical insulation in the United States. We have expanded from a single branch in Southern California to over 200 branches across North America, carrying a broad array of more than 35,000 SKUs. We have grown sales faster than any U.S. publicly traded building products distributor over the same period. Our goal is to be the leading company within specialty building products distribution and to continue expanding into complementary markets.\nWe were founded in 2011 by our President and Chief Executive Officer Ruben Mendoza, our Chief Financial Officer John Gorey and one of our Regional Vice Presidents, Tom Fischbeck. Mr. Mendoza previously served as CEO of Acoustical Material Services where he oversaw the successful growth of the company before it was acquired by Allied Building Products in 2007. In founding our company, Mr. Mendoza applied a proven customer-centric operating model to an organization that would combine strong organic growth with an effective acquisition and integration program across a fragmented industry, where he and other members of management had long and close personal relationships with many private acquisition candidates in our industry. In our early years we were focused on opening or acquiring new branches to leverage our founders' customer focus and strong supplier relationships. In 2012 and 2013, we began rapidly growing through both organic growth and acquisitions, and by the end of 2013, we significantly increased our number of branches and geographic footprint, and expanded from California into the Midwest, Florida and Arizona. This rapid growth resulted in the acquisition of our current ERP platform and information technology structure and added a deep bench of leaders from the acquired companies to prepare for future growth. In addition, in November 2013, we strengthened our management team with the addition of our Chief Operating Officer Pete Welly, who has over 35 years of experience in our industry.\nIn 2014 and 2015, we expanded into Texas through three acquisitions, and acquired branches in Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania. We also increased our market position in California and Arizona with wallboard and metal framing customers. These acquisitions further strengthened our relationship with key suppliers such as Armstrong and USG. Our nationwide presence, as well as our ability to achieve operating efficiencies while leveraging a national purchasing platform, led to favorable margin improvement.\nIn August 2016, we entered the Canadian market through our acquisition of Winroc-SPI for cash consideration of $314.1 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments, which increased our sales and expanded our relationship with Armstrong. Winroc-SPI's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $745.3 million. We also became the second largest specialty distributor and one of the largest fabricators of commercial and industrial mechanical insulation in the United States. The expansion into commercial and industrial insulation products both diversified our customer base and allowed us to capitalize on some of the strengths of our proven operating model given that wallboard distributors and commercial and industrial insulation distributors have similar business models. The Winroc-SPI acquisition strategically opened new markets in both the United States and Canada, added the industry-leading suspended ceiling systems line in additional geographies, and broadened our product offering in many U.S. markets.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn February 15, 2017, we completed our initial public offering of 12,800,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $14.00 per share. Our common stock began trading on the NYSE on February 10, 2017 under the ticker symbol \"FBM\". After underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses payable by us, net proceeds from the IPO were $164.0 million. We used these proceeds to repay borrowings outstanding under our ABL Credit Facility.\nDescription of Segments\nWe have two reportable segments. Resources are allocated and performance is assessed by our CEO, whom we have determined to be our Chief Operating Decision Maker, or CODM. Management evaluates performance for each segment based on gross profit. The reportable segments are described below.\nSpecialty Building Products\nSpecialty building products, or SBP, distributes wallboard, metal framing, suspended ceiling systems and complementary and other products. Complementary and other products include wallboard accessories, stucco and exterior insulation and finish systems, or EIFS, as well as other offerings, such as tools, safety accessories and fasteners. The primary end markets served are new non-residential, new residential and non-residential repair and remodel construction markets.\nMechanical Insulation\nMechanical insulation, or MI, includes insulation solutions for pipes and mechanical systems and the primary end markets served are new non-residential construction, non-residential repair and remodel construction and industrial markets.\nFactors and Trends Affecting Our Business and Results of Operations\nGeneral Economic Conditions and Outlook\nDemand for our products is impacted by changes in general economic conditions, including, in particular, conditions in the U.S. commercial construction and housing markets. Our end markets are broadly categorized as new non-residential construction, new residential construction, non-residential repair and remodel construction and industrial. We believe each of our end markets is currently in an extended period of recovery following a deep and prolonged recession.\nNew Non-Residential Construction\nNon-residential construction encompasses all construction other than residential structures. Non-residential construction growth is primarily influenced by economic growth, business investment, job growth, vacancy rates and availability and cost of capital. Based on U.S. Census Bureau data, growth in commercial construction spending generally lags new residential spending by approximately 18 months and we believe the commercial construction market remains in the early stages of a recovery. According to Dodge Data & Analytics, non-residential construction starts were 1,112 million square feet in 2017 and would need to increase by 22.6% to achieve the historical annual market average. Given the recent growth in the residential market, management believes that non-residential construction remains in the early stages of its recovery and expects volumes to gain momentum in the coming years in areas such as retail, lodging and healthcare. According to Dodge Data & Analytics, non-residential construction starts are expected to grow at approximately a compound annual growth rate of 4.6% from 2017 to 2019.\nNew Residential Construction\nJob growth is an important factor for a healthy housing market and unemployment has fallen from its peak of 10.0% in 2009 to 4.1% as of December 2017 according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, total housing starts in 2017 were 1.2 million. While housing starts have significantly recovered from the 0.55 million seen in 2009, they are still 17.3% below the 50-year average of 1.4 million starts per year. National housing affordability has led to higher household formation rates that are up after years of being below the historical trend line.\nNon-Residential Repair and Remodel Construction\nNon-residential repair and remodeling spending tends to be resilient through economic downturns as new construction spending slows and investments in existing infrastructure increase. From 2013 to 2017 non-residential repair and remodeling starts grew at a 6.7% CAGR and are expected to continue to grow at a 3.5% annual growth rate through 2018 according to Dodge Data & Analytics. The Architectural Billings index also forecasts continued growth, and public construction spending is anticipated to be up modestly in 2018.\nIndustrial\nIndustrial end markets represent a portion of the U.S. mechanical insulation market. Commercial and industrial insulation products are used in industrial end markets for piping and ducting in facilities. Industrial production is expected to be strong in 2018, while higher energy prices support MRO spending. Management estimates that power generation facilities make up the largest component of the industrial end market. Stable demand for insulation is expected as power generators construct new facilities and expand old ones.\nVolume, Costs and Pricing Programs\nOur product costs are directly impacted by fluctuations in supplier pricing and our purchasing volume. As one of the leading wallboard, suspended ceiling systems and commercial and industrial insulation distributors in the United States and Canada, we are able to negotiate volume discounts and favorable pricing terms with our suppliers. We have historically realized purchasing synergies almost immediately after an acquisition by taking advantage of our volume discounts. As we have continued to grow, we have negotiated with our suppliers on a national level in an effort to maximize these programs across our entire branch network, and expect to continue this trend in the future.\nAcquisitions\nWe supplement our organic growth strategy with selective acquisitions, and during the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed 10 acquisitions totaling 19 branches. See Note 3, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that significant opportunities exist to continue to expand our geographic footprint and product offerings by executing additional strategic acquisitions, and we maintain an extensive and active acquisition pipeline. We are typically evaluating several acquisition opportunities at any given time. In executing our acquisition strategy and integrating acquired companies, we focus on the cost savings we can achieve through integrated procurement and pricing programs and brand consolidation. The 10 acquisitions completed in 2017 contributed approximately $78.4 million of net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. As of February 26, 2018, all of the acquisitions made through December 31, 2017 have been fully integrated.\n\nAs part of our accounting for business combinations, we are required to value inventory acquired in the business combination at its net realizable value. The inventory adjustment is typically fully recognized in cost of goods sold within the first month after completion of an acquisition. This step-up in basis and related expense has a negative effect on margins as the related inventory is sold. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, the period from October 9, 2015 to December 31, 2015 and the period from January 1, 2015 to October 8, 2015, the impact of the acquired step-up in inventory basis to cost of goods sold was $0.8 million, $6.5 million, $7.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively.\nSeasonality\nOur operating results are typically affected by seasonality. Warmer and drier weather during the second and third quarters typically result in higher activity and sales levels. The first and fourth quarters typically have lower levels of activity and lower working capital requirements due to inclement weather conditions.\nBasis of Presentation\nOn October 9, 2015, Lone Star, along with certain members of management, acquired 100% of the outstanding equity of FBM Intermediate Holdings LLC in the Lone Star Acquisition.\nThe period from January 1, 2015 through October 8, 2015 and the period from October 9, 2015 through December 31, 2015 relate, respectively, to the periods in 2015 preceding and succeeding completion of the Lone Star Acquisition. The terms Predecessor and Successor refer to the pre- and post-Lone Star Acquisition financial position and results of the Company, respectively. Due to the Lone Star Acquisition, the basis of accounting changed and reflects the application of the acquisition method. The new basis of accounting primarily impacted the values of our inventory, long-lived assets and intangible assets, and resulted in increased depreciation and amortization.\nResults of Operations\nThe Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table summarizes certain consolidated financial information related to our operating results for the periods indicated:\n\nThe Company's net sales by segment and major product line, and segment gross profit and gross margin, are as follows:\n\nNet Sales\nConsolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $2,060.9 million compared to $1,392.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $668.4 million, or 48.0%. Net sales from acquired branches and existing branches that were strategically combined contributed $624.0 million of the increase. Base business net sales increased $44.4 million, or 5.8% to $816.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe increase in our base business net sales was primarily driven by the following factors:\n \u2022 an increase in wallboard sales of $14.1 million, or 4.3%, due to a wallboard unit volume increase of approximately 1.9% driven by an increase in the commercial and residential end markets, and an increase in average selling price and product mix of 2.4%; \n \u2022 an increase in suspended ceiling systems sales of approximately $11.5 million, or 11.3%, primarily due to increased market share gains in several states; \n \u2022 an increase in metal framing sales of approximately $5.7 million, or 4.1%, primarily due to increased market share gains in several states; and \n \u2022 an increase in complementary and other product sales of $13.2 million, or 6.3%, primarily due to continued product sales growth. \nThe table below highlights net sales from our base business and acquired and combined branches:  Year Ended December 31, Change 2017 2016 $ % (in thousands) Base business (1) $ 815,987 $ 771,571 $ 44,416 5.8 % Acquired and combined (2) 1,244,915 620,938 623,977 100.5 % Net sales $ 2,060,902 $ 1,392,509 $ 668,393 48.0 % (1) Represents net sales from branches that were owned by us since January 1, 2016 and branches that were opened by us during such period. (2) Represents branches acquired and existing branches combined with acquired branches after January 1, 2016. \nThe table below highlights our changes in base business net sales and net sales from branches acquired and strategically combined by segment and major product line:\n\nSpecialty Building Products. SBP net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $1,790.1 million compared to $1,293.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $496.6 million, or 38.4%. Net sales from acquired branches and existing branches that were strategically combined with acquired branches contributed $452.2 million of the increase, primarily due to the acquisition of Winroc-SPI in August 2016. SBP base business net sales also increased by $44.4 million due to product expansion into new markets and the overall market growth in both the commercial and residential construction markets. The drivers for the increases in net sales of the SBP product categories are consistent with the drivers for consolidated net sales.\nMechanical Insulation. MI net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $270.8 million compared to $99.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. We entered the mechanical insulation market as a result of the Winroc-SPI acquisition on August 9, 2016; therefore, there was a shorter period of sales in this segment during the prior year period.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nConsolidated gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $597.9 million compared to $396.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $201.1 million, or 50.7%. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in sales volume and contributions from acquisitions. Gross profit from our base business contributed $17.8 million of the increase reflecting a 0.6% margin improvement over the prior year and gross profit from acquired businesses contributed the remaining $183.3 million of the increase reflecting a 1.0% margin improvement. Consolidated gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 29.0% compared to 28.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a $0.8 million charge for inventory fair value purchase accounting adjustments as compared to $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the effect of these adjustments, gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 29.0% for both years.\nSpecialty Building Products. SBP gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $522.2 million compared to $371.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $150.5 million, or 40.5%. SBP gross profit increased with higher sales volume from both acquisitions and base business growth. Gross profit from our base business contributed $17.8 million of the increase reflecting a 0.6% margin improvement over the prior year and gross profit from acquired businesses contributed the remaining $132.7 million of the increase reflecting a 0.8% margin improvement. SBP gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 29.2% compared to 28.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016. SBP gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a $0.7 million charge for inventory fair value purchase accounting adjustments as compared to $4.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the effect of these adjustments, SBP gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 29.2% as compared to 29.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the effect of the inventory fair value purchase accounting adjustments, the increase in SBP gross margin was primarily due to continued pricing discipline across markets we serve.\nMechanical Insulation. MI gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $75.7 million compared to $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $50.6 million, or 201.6%. MI gross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the timing of the Winroc-SPI acquisition in August 2016 and not realizing a full year ended of results in the prior year. MI gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 27.9% compared to 25.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016. MI gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a $0.1 million charge for inventory fair value purchase accounting adjustments as compared to $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the effect of these adjustments, MI gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 28.0% as compared to 27.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in MI gross margin, excluding the effect of the inventory fair value purchase accounting adjustments, was primarily due to operational efficiencies.\nSelling, General & Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses consist of warehouse, delivery and general and administrative expenses. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $461.6 million compared to $328.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $132.7 million, or 40.4%. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 22.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower transaction costs and improved operating efficiencies.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $76.9 million compared to $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $25.5 million, or 49.6%. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the Winroc-SPI acquisition in August 2016, which significantly increased the value of property and equipment and intangible assets subject to depreciation and amortization.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $61.1 million compared to $52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $8.6 million, or 16.3%. The increase in interest expense is due to the senior secured notes, or the Notes, issued for the Winroc-SPI acquisition being outstanding for the full year.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $81.5 million compared to an expense of $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to a reduction in our Tax Receivable Agreement, or TRA, liability of $68.0 million and the change in fair value of the embedded derivative of $13.2 million, which represents an early prepayment option of our Notes due 2021. See Note 19, Tax Receivable Agreement, and Note 8, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate for years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were (3.3%) and 34.2%, respectively. Our tax rates are affected by recurring items, such as non-deductible transaction costs and varying tax rates between the United States and Canada. They are also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year. In addition to state income taxes, the items that had the most significant impact on the difference between our statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% and our effective tax rate were the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% in the 2017 tax reform legislation, which both significantly reduced our liability under the TRA with our majority stockholder, which resulted in a $68.0 million gain on the write down of the liability that was treated as a non-taxable permanent item and resulted in a 29.8% benefit to the overall effective rate, and the write down of the period-ending deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2017, which resulted in a provisional $9.1 million credit to income tax that gave rise to a provisional 11.4% benefit to the overall effective tax rate. In 2016, non-deductible IPO and acquisition related expenses of $1.5 million resulted in a 3.4% increase to the overall effective tax rate. See Note 5, Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 (Successor)\nThe following table summarizes certain financial information relating to our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\nNet Sales\nNet sales were $1,392.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our base business net sales (net sales from branches that were owned by us since January 1, 2015 and branches that were opened by us during such period) increased $49.7 million, or 9.3%, from $532.8 million to $582.5 million period over period.\nThe table below highlights net sales from our base business and acquired and combined branches:\n\n (1) Represents net sales from branches that were owned by us since January 1, 2015 and branches that were opened by us during such period. \n (2) Represents branches acquired and existing branches combined with acquired branches after January 1, 2015. \nSpecialty Building Products. Net sales were $1,293.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which were driven by the overall market growth in both the commercial and residential construction markets and our increased market share in 2016 versus 2015. Winroc-SPI, which was acquired in August 2016, contributed $193.9 million to the SBP segment. Wallboard accounted for the majority of SBP sales for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nMechanical Insulation. Net sales were $99.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. We entered the mechanical insulation market as a result of the Winroc-SPI acquisition on August 9, 2016, therefore, net sales reflects sales from the acquisition date to December 31, 2016.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold was $995.7 million, or 71.5% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Cost of goods sold was negatively impacted by $6.5 million of inventory fair value adjustments related to our acquisitions.

SG&A expenses were impacted by warehousing and delivery costs driven by increased net sales and acquired branches. Payroll related and other expenses also increased due to our continued investment in infrastructure and support of our operations. We also incurred expenses as a result of our initial public offering and other transaction costs of $23.2 million. ERP system implementation costs for the year were $3.9 million.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was affected by an increase in property and equipment and intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions in 2015 and 2016. Additionally, the historical cost basis of property and equipment and intangible assets was increased to fair value as a result of the Lone Star Acquisition.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due to outstanding indebtedness related to acquisitions and funding of working capital. In addition, we incurred a loss of $7.0 million related to the refinancing of the 2015 asset-based lending credit facility, or the 2015 Credit Facility, in August 2016.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net was $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the $7.1 million change in fair value of the early prepayment option of our Notes.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nAn income tax benefit of $14.7 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016, which represents an effective tax rate of 34.2%.\nPeriod from October 9, 2015 to December 31, 2015 (Successor)\nThe following table summarizes certain financial information relating to our operating results for the period from October 9, 2015 to December 31, 2015:\n\nNet Sales\nNet sales were $192.5 million, all from the SBP segment, which primarily consisted of wallboard and accessories.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold was $143.3 million, which included $7.5 million of inventory fair value adjustments, and resulted in gross profit of $49.2 million, or gross margin of 25.6%.

As of October 9, 2015, we were considered a C-corporation for tax purposes while for periods prior to such date we had subsidiaries that were either nontaxable limited liability companies or taxable C-corporations. The effective tax rate for the period was 37.4%, which differs from the statutory rate primarily due to state taxes.\nPeriod from January 1, 2015 to October 8, 2015 (Predecessor)\nThe following table summarizes certain financial information relating to our operating results for the period from January 1, 2015 to October 8, 2015:\n\nNet Sales\nNet sales were $628.1 million, all from the SBP segment, which primarily consisted of wallboard and accessories.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold was $452.9 million, which included $1.6 million of inventory fair value adjustments, and resulted in gross profit of $175.2 million, or gross margin of 27.9%.

We believe that these sources of funds will be adequate to fund debt service requirements and provide cash, as required, to support our strategy, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, lease obligations and working capital for at least the next twelve months. However, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain future debt or equity financings adequate for our future cash requirements on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The tax receivable agreement may also have a negative impact on our liquidity if, among other things, payments we make under the tax receivable agreement exceed the actual cash savings we and our subsidiaries realize in respect of the tax benefits covered by the tax receivable agreement after we have paid our taxes and other obligations. In addition, as a result of either an early termination of the tax receivable agreement or a change of control, we could be required to make payments under the agreement that exceed our actual cash savings under the tax receivable agreement. In these situations, our obligations under the tax receivable agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing, among other things, capital expenditures and acquisitions.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay additional acquisitions, future investments and capital expenditures, seek additional capital, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, or sell assets. Significant delays in our ability to finance planned acquisitions or capital expenditures may materially and adversely affect our future sales prospects. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the Notes and our ABL Credit Facility, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Our tax receivable agreement requires that, after Lone Star no longer controls us, any senior debt document that refinances or replaces our existing indebtedness permit our subsidiaries to make dividends to us, without any conditions, to the extent required for us to make its payments under the tax receivable agreement, unless Lone Star otherwise consents. At the time of any such refinancing, it may not be possible to include this term in such senior debt documents, and as a result, we may need Lone Star's consent to complete such refinancing. The ABL Credit Agreement and the Indenture restrict our ability to enter into certain asset sales transactions. We may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair, and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had available aggregate undrawn borrowing capacity of approximately $252.5 million under the ABL Credit Facility. For the periods presented, our use of cash was primarily driven by our investing activities, specifically our investments in acquisitions.\nCash Flows\nA summary of net cash provided by, or used in, operating, investing and financing activities is shown in the following table.\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes and the effects of changes in working capital.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $44.2 million to $77.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $33.1 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net income of $110.9 million, higher depreciation and amortization of $25.5 million due to an increase in fixed assets and intangibles as a result of acquisitions, higher amortization of debt issuance costs of $4.0 million related to higher levels of debt as a result of acquisitions and changes in deferred income taxes of $11.6 million due to new tax legislation, partially offset by a reduction in the TRA liability of $68.0 million due to new tax legislation, higher working capital expenditures of $9.9 million, increased unrealized gains related to the change in fair value of our derivatives of $20.0 million, lower inventory fair value adjustments of $5.7 million due to the lower value of acquisitions and lower losses on the extinguishment of debt of $5.4 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, consisted of a net loss of $28.4 million, offset by non-cash items of $61.8 million of which $51.4 million was depreciation and amortization.

Cash provided by working capital was $3.2 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the period from January 1, 2015 to October 8, 2015, consisted of a net loss of $29.5 million, partially offset by non-cash items of $20.5 million, of which $15.6 million was depreciation and amortization. Cash provided by working capital was $28.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities consists primarily of acquisitions and capital expenditures, including purchases of land, buildings, leasehold improvements, fleet assets, information technology and other equipment. Capital expenditures vary depending on prevailing business factors, including current and anticipated market conditions. Historically, capital expenditures generally have been made at relatively low levels in comparison to the operating cash flows generated during the corresponding periods.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $334.9 million to $96.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $431.8 million in the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a lower aggregate purchase price of acquisitions of $324.0 million and net proceeds related to net working capital adjustments from acquisitions of $8.2 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $431.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we acquired Winroc-SPI, Ken Builder Supply, Inc., or Ken API, Kent Gypsum Supply, Co., Mid America Drywall Supply, Inc. and United Drywall Supply for aggregate consideration of $401.9 million. Cash used for capital expenditures was $30.5 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the 2015 Successor period was $660.3 million and primarily related to $549.3 million used in the Lone Star Acquisition and $103.2 million to acquire Gypsum Supply Co., or GSCIL.

(collectively, \"Great Western\"). Cash used for capital expenditures was $9.8 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by, or used in, financing activities consists primarily of borrowings and related repayments under our financing agreements and proceeds from capital contributions.\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $413.8 million to $2.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $416.7 million in the same period in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, IPO proceeds of $164.0 million were used for debt repayments, compared to net borrowings of $350.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $416.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net borrowings of $350.5 million and capital contributions of $66.2 million were used to finance the acquisitions made in 2016 and fund operations.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the 2015 Successor period was $642.7 million, and primarily consisted of net borrowings of $379.8 million to finance the Lone Star Acquisition and capital contributions of $272.9 million, offset by $10.0 million in debt repayments.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the 2015 Predecessor period was $86.6 million was primarily due to financing related to the Great Western acquisition.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017. Some of the amounts included in the table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, our actual payments may vary from those reflected in the table.\n\nWe lease certain facilities and equipment under various operating lease agreements with expiration dates through 2026. These lease agreements typically contain renewal options of five to ten years. Additionally, with the acquisitions of Winroc-SPI and Ken API in 2016, we assumed capital lease obligations with lease terms ranging from five to 15 years.\nABL Credit Facility\nOn August 9, 2016, we entered into the ABL Credit Agreement providing for the ABL Credit Facility, a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, and on September 23, 2016, we entered into an incremental facility amendment to the ABL Credit Facility, increasing the size of the revolving commitments thereunder by $50.0 million. The ABL Credit Facility provides for a $300.0 million revolving credit facility and matures on February 9, 2021. The ABL Credit Facility includes an option to further increase the maximum commitments up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (i) $50.0 million and (ii) such amount as would not cause the total revolving credit commitments under the ABL Credit Facility to exceed the aggregate borrowing base under the ABL Credit Facility by more than $50.0 million, in each case as of the date of such incurrence, subject to the conditions set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement.\nInterest on borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility accrues at a rate equal to LIBOR or Canadian Dollar Offered Rate, or CDOR (as applicable, based on the currency of the borrowing), plus a margin of 1.25% to 1.75% based on average daily excess availability for the most recent fiscal quarter, or if selected by the borrower, ABR or the Canadian prime rate (as applicable, based on the currency of the borrowings) plus a margin of 0.25% to 0.75% based on average daily excess availability for the most recent fiscal quarter, in all such cases subject to an additional 2.0% on overdue amounts during certain default events.\nThe ABL Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, representations and warranties and events of default, including covenants which generally restrict our business and limit our ability to, among other things: dispose of certain assets; incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; enter into new lines of business; make certain investments, intercompany loans or payments in respect of indebtedness; incur or maintain liens; modify certain terms of our or their organizational documents, certain agreements or certain debt instruments; declare or pay dividends or make other restricted payments (including redemption of our stock); engage in certain transactions with affiliates; enter into certain sale leaseback transactions; modify the terms of certain of our existing contractual agreements; and engage in mergers, consolidations or the sale or disposition of substantially all of its assets. The ABL Credit Agreement also includes representations and warranties which we must be able to make in order to obtain borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility, and a financial maintenance covenant and events of default related to, among other things: the non-payment of principal, interest or fees; violations of covenants; material inaccuracy of representations or warranties; failure to timely deliver a borrowing base certificate; certain bankruptcy events; certain events under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; invalidity of guarantees or security interests; default in payment under or the acceleration of other indebtedness; material judgments; and certain change of control events, each of which could result in the facility being terminated and any outstanding debt becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity. The financial maintenance covenant under the ABL Credit Agreement is a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test set at a level of 1.00:1.00, which is based in part on our adjusted EBITDA as calculated pursuant to the ABL Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2017, the fixed charge coverage ratio exceeded the minimum requirement. This covenant is only tested at times when availability under the ABL Credit Facility is less than a certain threshold, which was $30.0 million at December 31, 2017. We were in compliance with all covenants under the ABL Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the majority of our liquidity was from the $252.5 million available under the ABL Credit Facility. The fixed charge coverage ratio is a material term of the ABL Credit Agreement and we believe information about how the covenant is calculated is material to an investor's understanding of the Company's financial condition and liquidity.\nShould we not comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio, we would be in technical default of our ABL Credit Facility which could result in the facility being terminated and any outstanding debt becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity. Should all amounts become due immediately, we may be unable to pay all amounts due under the ABL Credit Facility without a material impact to our business, as we may be forced to liquidate assets to pay for all amounts due under the ABL Credit Facility.\nNotes\nIn August 2016, we completed a private offering of $575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. In the offering we received net proceeds of approximately $563.5 million, which were used in part to repay and terminate the 2015 Credit Facility. The Notes carry a coupon of 8.25% per annum and mature August 15, 2021. The Indenture contains customary covenants, representations and warranties and events of default, including covenants which generally restrict our business and limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, issue certain preferred shares, pay dividends, redeem our stock or make other distributions, make certain investments, limit the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to us or make other intercompany transfers, create liens, sell or transfer certain assets, engage in certain transactions with respect to all or substantially all of our assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates and designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. The Indenture also contains events of default related to, among other things: the non-payment of principal, premium or interest on any Note; violations of any agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture and related documents; certain bankruptcy events; invalidity of guarantees or security interests; default in payment under or the acceleration of other indebtedness; and material judgments, any of which could result in the trustee for the Notes declaring the principal of the Notes together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon to be immediately due and payable. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Indenture as of December 31, 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements or similar obligations, such as financing or unconsolidated variable interest entities.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reported period.\nOn an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates that are more susceptible to change in the near term are the allowance for doubtful accounts, the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory and recoverability of long-lived assets. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when the risks and obligations of ownership have been transferred to the customer, which generally occurs at the time of delivery to the customer. At the time that revenue is recognized we record reductions in sales for customer rebates and discounts including volume, cash and other discounts. Rebates and discounts are recorded based on management's best estimate when products are sold based on historical experience for similar programs and products. Management reviews these rebates and discounts on an ongoing basis and the related accruals are adjusted, if necessary, as additional information becomes available. Historically, our actual customer rebates and discounts have not been materially different from management's original estimates.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe sell to customers using credit terms customary in our industry. Accounts receivables are recorded at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our estimate of credit exposure, determined principally on the basis of our collection experience, aging of our receivables and significant individual account credit risk. If the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance, our operating results would be significantly adversely affected.\nOther Receivables\nOther receivables primarily consist of vendor rebates receivables. Typical arrangements with vendors provide for us to receive a rebate of a specified amount after achieving any of a number of measures generally related to the volume of purchases over a period of time. We record these rebates to effectively reduce the cost of sales in the period in which the product is sold. Throughout the year, our estimates include the amount of rebates receivable for the vendor programs based on the expected level of purchases. We accrue for vendor rebates earned based on purchase volumes and adjust inventories to reflect the reduction in the cost basis for inventories purchased that are subject to vendor", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited, to those described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and elsewhere. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are the second largest specialty distributor of wallboard and suspended ceiling systems in the United States and Canada, and the fastest growing by sales and branch count since our founding in 2011. We are also the second largest specialty distributor and one of the largest fabricators of commercial and industrial mechanical insulation in the United States. We have expanded from a single branch in Southern California to over 200 branches across North America, carrying a broad array of more than 35,000 SKUs. We have grown sales faster than any U.S. publicly traded building products distributor over the same period. Our goal is to be the leading company within specialty building products distribution and to continue expanding into complementary markets.\nWe were founded in 2011 by our President and Chief Executive Officer Ruben Mendoza, our Chief Financial Officer John Gorey and one of our Regional Vice Presidents, Tom Fischbeck. Mr. Mendoza previously served as CEO of Acoustical Material Services where he oversaw the successful growth of the company before it was acquired by Allied Building Products in 2007. In founding our company, Mr. Mendoza applied a proven customer-centric operating model to an organization that would combine strong organic growth with an effective acquisition and integration program across a fragmented industry, where he and other members of management had long and close personal relationships with many private acquisition candidates in our industry. In our early years we were focused on opening or acquiring new branches to leverage our founders' customer focus and strong supplier relationships. In 2012 and 2013, we began rapidly growing through both organic growth and acquisitions, and by the end of 2013, we significantly increased our number of branches and geographic footprint, and expanded from California into the Midwest, Florida and Arizona. This rapid growth resulted in the acquisition of our current ERP platform and information technology structure and added a deep bench of leaders from the acquired companies to prepare for future growth. In addition, in November 2013, we strengthened our management team with the addition of our Chief Operating Officer Pete Welly, who has over 35 years of experience in our industry.\nIn 2014 and 2015, we expanded into Texas through three acquisitions, and acquired branches in Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania. We also increased our market position in California and Arizona with wallboard and metal framing customers. These acquisitions further strengthened our relationship with key suppliers such as Armstrong and USG. Our nationwide presence, as well as our ability to achieve operating efficiencies while leveraging a national purchasing platform, led to favorable margin improvement.\nIn August 2016, we entered the Canadian market through our acquisition of Winroc-SPI for cash consideration of $314.1 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments, which increased our sales and expanded our relationship with Armstrong. Winroc-SPI's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $745.3 million. We also became the second largest specialty distributor and one of the largest fabricators of commercial and industrial mechanical insulation in the United States. The expansion into commercial and industrial insulation products both diversified our customer base and allowed us to capitalize on some of the strengths of our proven operating model given that wallboard distributors and commercial and industrial insulation distributors have similar business models. The Winroc-SPI acquisition strategically opened new markets in both the United States and Canada, added the industry-leading suspended ceiling systems line in additional geographies, and broadened our product offering in many U.S. markets.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn February 15, 2017, we completed our initial public offering of 12,800,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $14.00 per share. Our common stock began trading on the NYSE on February 10, 2017 under the ticker symbol \"FBM\". After underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses payable by us, net proceeds from the IPO were $164.0 million. We used these proceeds to repay borrowings outstanding under our ABL Credit Facility.\nDescription of Segments\nWe have two reportable segments. Resources are allocated and performance is assessed by our CEO, whom we have determined to be our Chief Operating Decision Maker, or CODM. Management evaluates performance for each segment based on gross profit. The reportable segments are described below.\nSpecialty Building Products\nSpecialty building products, or SBP, distributes wallboard, metal framing, suspended ceiling systems and complementary and other products. Complementary and other products include wallboard accessories, stucco and exterior insulation and finish systems, or EIFS, as well as other offerings, such as tools, safety accessories and fasteners. The primary end markets served are new non-residential, new residential and non-residential repair and remodel construction markets.\nMechanical Insulation\nMechanical insulation, or MI, includes insulation solutions for pipes and mechanical systems and the primary end markets served are new non-residential construction, non-residential repair and remodel construction and industrial markets.\nFactors and Trends Affecting Our Business and Results of Operations\nGeneral Economic Conditions and Outlook\nDemand for our products is impacted by changes in general economic conditions, including, in particular, conditions in the U.S. commercial construction and housing markets. Our end markets are broadly categorized as new non-residential construction, new residential construction, non-residential repair and remodel construction and industrial. We believe each of our end markets is currently in an extended period of recovery following a deep and prolonged recession.\nNew Non-Residential Construction\nNon-residential construction encompasses all construction other than residential structures. Non-residential construction growth is primarily influenced by economic growth, business investment, job growth, vacancy rates and availability and cost of capital. Based on U.S. Census Bureau data, growth in commercial construction spending generally lags new residential spending by approximately 18 months and we believe the commercial construction market remains in the early stages of a recovery. According to Dodge Data & Analytics, non-residential construction starts were 1,112 million square feet in 2017 and would need to increase by 22.6% to achieve the historical annual market average. Given the recent growth in the residential market, management believes that non-residential construction remains in the early stages of its recovery and expects volumes to gain momentum in the coming years in areas such as retail, lodging and healthcare. According to Dodge Data & Analytics, non-residential construction starts are expected to grow at approximately a compound annual growth rate of 4.6% from 2017 to 2019.\nNew Residential Construction\nJob growth is an important factor for a healthy housing market and unemployment has fallen from its peak of 10.0% in 2009 to 4.1% as of December 2017 according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, total housing starts in 2017 were 1.2 million. While housing starts have significantly recovered from the 0.55 million seen in 2009, they are still 17.3% below the 50-year average of 1.4 million starts per year. National housing affordability has led to higher household formation rates that are up after years of being below the historical trend line.\nNon-Residential Repair and Remodel Construction\nNon-residential repair and remodeling spending tends to be resilient through economic downturns as new construction spending slows and investments in existing infrastructure increase. From 2013 to 2017 non-residential repair and remodeling starts grew at a 6.7% CAGR and are expected to continue to grow at a 3.5% annual growth rate through 2018 according to Dodge Data & Analytics. The Architectural Billings index also forecasts continued growth, and public construction spending is anticipated to be up modestly in 2018.\nIndustrial\nIndustrial end markets represent a portion of the U.S. mechanical insulation market. Commercial and industrial insulation products are used in industrial end markets for piping and ducting in facilities. Industrial production is expected to be strong in 2018, while higher energy prices support MRO spending. Management estimates that power generation facilities make up the largest component of the industrial end market. Stable demand for insulation is expected as power generators construct new facilities and expand old ones.\nVolume, Costs and Pricing Programs\nOur product costs are directly impacted by fluctuations in supplier pricing and our purchasing volume. As one of the leading wallboard, suspended ceiling systems and commercial and industrial insulation distributors in the United States and Canada, we are able to negotiate volume discounts and favorable pricing terms with our suppliers. We have historically realized purchasing synergies almost immediately after an acquisition by taking advantage of our volume discounts. As we have continued to grow, we have negotiated with our suppliers on a national level in an effort to maximize these programs across our entire branch network, and expect to continue this trend in the future.\nAcquisitions\nWe supplement our organic growth strategy with selective acquisitions, and during the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed 10 acquisitions totaling 19 branches. See Note 3, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that significant opportunities exist to continue to expand our geographic footprint and product offerings by executing additional strategic acquisitions, and we maintain an extensive and active acquisition pipeline. We are typically evaluating several acquisition opportunities at any given time. In executing our acquisition strategy and integrating acquired companies, we focus on the cost savings we can achieve through integrated procurement and pricing programs and brand consolidation. The 10 acquisitions completed in 2017 contributed approximately $78.4 million of net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. As of February 26, 2018, all of the acquisitions made through December 31, 2017 have been fully integrated.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effective Date of Acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Branch Locations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td># of Branches Acquired\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Del-Pro Building Supplies, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ontario, Canada\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MCS Door & Hardware\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>American Wal-Board, LLC, American Materials, LLC, American Drywall & Roofing, LLC and JLS Equipment Leasing, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>TN, MS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceiling and Wall Supply, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MO, IL, KY\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Virginia Builders' Supply, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>VA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wallboard, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gypsum Wallboard Supply, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>WA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trident Distribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>GA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Irwin Builders Supply Corporation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 3, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dominion Interior Supply Corporation and Dominion Interior Supply of Roanoke LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 3, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>VA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs part of our accounting for business combinations, we are required to value inventory acquired in the business combination at its net realizable value. The inventory adjustment is typically fully recognized in cost of goods sold within the first month after completion of an acquisition. This step-up in basis and related expense has a negative effect on margins as the related inventory is sold. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, the period from October 9, 2015 to December 31, 2015 and the period from January 1, 2015 to October 8, 2015, the impact of the acquired step-up in inventory basis to cost of goods sold was $0.8 million, $6.5 million, $7.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively.\nSeasonality\nOur operating results are typically affected by seasonality. Warmer and drier weather during the second and third quarters typically result in higher activity and sales levels. The first and fourth quarters typically have lower levels of activity and lower working capital requirements due to inclement weather conditions.\nBasis of Presentation\nOn October 9, 2015, Lone Star, along with certain members of management, acquired 100% of the outstanding equity of FBM Intermediate Holdings LLC in the Lone Star Acquisition.\nThe period from January 1, 2015 through October 8, 2015 and the period from October 9, 2015 through December 31, 2015 relate, respectively, to the periods in 2015 preceding and succeeding completion of the Lone Star Acquisition. The terms Predecessor and Successor refer to the pre- and post-Lone Star Acquisition financial position and results of the Company, respectively. Due to the Lone Star Acquisition, the basis of accounting changed and reflects the application of the acquisition method. The new basis of accounting primarily impacted the values of our inventory, long-lived assets and intangible assets, and resulted in increased depreciation and amortization.\nResults of

Net sales from acquired branches and existing branches that were strategically combined with acquired branches contributed $452.2 million of the increase, primarily due to the acquisition of Winroc-SPI in August 2016. SBP base business net sales also increased by $44.4 million due to product expansion into new markets and the overall market growth in both the commercial and residential construction markets. The drivers for the increases in net sales of the SBP product categories are consistent with the drivers for consolidated net sales.\nMechanical Insulation. MI net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $270.8 million compared to $99.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. We entered the mechanical insulation market as a result of the Winroc-SPI acquisition on August 9, 2016; therefore, there was a shorter period of sales in this segment during the prior year period.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nConsolidated gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $597.9 million compared to $396.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $201.1 million, or 50.7%. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in sales volume and contributions from acquisitions. Gross profit from our base business contributed $17.8 million of the increase reflecting a 0.6% margin improvement over the prior year and gross profit from acquired businesses contributed the remaining $183.3 million of the increase reflecting a 1.0% margin improvement. Consolidated gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 29.0% compared to 28.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Excluding the effect of the inventory fair value purchase accounting adjustments, the increase in SBP gross margin was primarily due to continued pricing discipline across markets we serve.\nMechanical Insulation. MI gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $75.7 million compared to $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $50.6 million, or 201.6%. MI gross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the timing of the Winroc-SPI acquisition in August 2016 and not realizing a full year ended of results in the prior year. MI gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 27.9% compared to 25.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016. MI gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a $0.1 million charge for inventory fair value purchase accounting adjustments as compared to $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the effect of these adjustments, MI gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 28.0% as compared to 27.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in MI gross margin, excluding the effect of the inventory fair value purchase accounting adjustments, was primarily due to operational efficiencies.\nSelling, General & Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses consist of warehouse, delivery and general and administrative expenses. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $461.6 million compared to $328.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $132.7 million, or 40.4%. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 22.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower transaction costs and improved operating efficiencies.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $76.9 million compared to $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $25.5 million, or 49.6%. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the Winroc-SPI acquisition in August 2016, which significantly increased the value of property and equipment and intangible assets subject to depreciation and amortization.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $61.1 million compared to $52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $8.6 million, or 16.3%. The increase in interest expense is due to the senior secured notes, or the Notes, issued for the Winroc-SPI acquisition being outstanding for the full year.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $81.5 million compared to an expense of $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to a reduction in our Tax Receivable Agreement, or TRA, liability of $68.0 million and the change in fair value of the embedded derivative of $13.2 million, which represents an early prepayment option of our Notes due 2021. See Note 19, Tax Receivable Agreement, and Note 8, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate for years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were (3.3%) and 34.2%, respectively. Our tax rates are affected by recurring items, such as non-deductible transaction costs and varying tax rates between the United States and Canada. They are also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year. In addition to state income taxes, the items that had the most significant impact on the difference between our statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% and our effective tax rate were the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% in the 2017 tax reform legislation, which both significantly reduced our liability under the TRA with our majority stockholder, which resulted in a $68.0 million gain on the write down of the liability that was treated as a non-taxable permanent item and resulted in a 29.8% benefit to the overall effective rate, and the write down of the period-ending deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2017, which resulted in a provisional $9.1 million credit to income tax that gave rise to a provisional 11.4% benefit to the overall effective tax rate. In 2016, non-deductible IPO and acquisition related expenses of $1.5 million resulted in a 3.4% increase to the overall effective tax rate.

Acquisition related expenses were $39.7 million and represents acquisition activity including the Lone Star Acquisition.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $15.6 million, and represented 2.5% of net sales. Depreciation and amortization includes the impact of the addition of property and equipment and intangible assets acquired.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $19.1 million as a result of our outstanding indebtedness.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit was $1.3 million and reflected the fact that we had subsidiaries that were either nontaxable limited liability companies or taxable C-corporations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSummary\nWe depend on cash flow from operations, cash on hand and funds available under our ABL Credit Facility, and in the future may depend on other debt financings allowed under the terms of the Indenture and ABL Credit Agreement and equity financings, to finance our acquisition strategy, working capital needs and capital expenditures. We believe that these sources of funds will be adequate to fund debt service requirements and provide cash, as required, to support our strategy, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, lease obligations and working capital for at least the next twelve months. However, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain future debt or equity financings adequate for our future cash requirements on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The tax receivable agreement may also have a negative impact on our liquidity if, among other things, payments we make under the tax receivable agreement exceed the actual cash savings we and our subsidiaries realize in respect of the tax benefits covered by the tax receivable agreement after we have paid our taxes and other obligations. In addition, as a result of either an early termination of the tax receivable agreement or a change of control, we could be required to make payments under the agreement that exceed our actual cash savings under the tax receivable agreement. In these situations, our obligations under the tax receivable agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing, among other things, capital expenditures and acquisitions.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay additional acquisitions, future investments and capital expenditures, seek additional capital, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, or sell assets. Significant delays in our ability to finance planned acquisitions or capital expenditures may materially and adversely affect our future sales prospects. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the Notes and our ABL Credit Facility, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Our tax receivable agreement requires that, after Lone Star no longer controls us, any senior debt document that refinances or replaces our existing indebtedness permit our subsidiaries to make dividends to us, without any conditions, to the extent required for us to make its payments under the tax receivable agreement, unless Lone Star otherwise consents. At the time of any such refinancing, it may not be possible to include this term in such senior debt documents, and as a result, we may need Lone Star's consent to complete such refinancing. The ABL Credit Agreement and the Indenture restrict our ability to enter into certain asset sales transactions. We may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair, and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had available aggregate undrawn borrowing capacity of approximately $252.5 million under the ABL Credit Facility. For the periods presented, our use of cash was primarily driven by our investing activities, specifically our investments in acquisitions.\nCash Flows\nA summary of net cash provided by, or used in, operating, investing and financing activities is shown in the following table.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 9, 2015\nto\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>January 1, 2015\nto\nOctober 8, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(96,938\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(431,805\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(660,323\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(97,266\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>416,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>642,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes and the effects of changes in working capital.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $44.2 million to $77.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $33.1 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net income of $110.9 million, higher depreciation and amortization of $25.5 million due to an increase in fixed assets and intangibles as a result of acquisitions, higher amortization of debt issuance costs of $4.0 million related to higher levels of debt as a result of acquisitions and changes in deferred income taxes of $11.6 million due to new tax legislation, partially offset by a reduction in the TRA liability of $68.0 million due to new tax legislation, higher working capital expenditures of $9.9 million, increased unrealized gains related to the change in fair value of our derivatives of $20.0 million, lower inventory fair value adjustments of $5.7 million due to the lower value of acquisitions and lower losses on the extinguishment of debt of $5.4 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, consisted of a net loss of $28.4 million, offset by non-cash items of $61.8 million of which $51.4 million was depreciation and amortization. Cash used for working capital was $0.3 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the period from October 9, 2015 to December 31, 2015, consisted of a net loss of $7.9 million, offset by non-cash items of $22.4 million, of which $7.2 million was depreciation and amortization, $7.5 million related to fair value inventory adjustments and $6.5 million related to deferred taxes. Cash provided by working capital was $3.2 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the period from January 1, 2015 to October 8, 2015, consisted of a net loss of $29.5 million, partially offset by non-cash items of $20.5 million, of which $15.6 million was depreciation and amortization. Cash provided by working capital was $28.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities consists primarily of acquisitions and capital expenditures, including purchases of land, buildings, leasehold improvements, fleet assets, information technology and other equipment. Capital expenditures vary depending on prevailing business factors, including current and anticipated market conditions. Historically, capital expenditures generally have been made at relatively low levels in comparison to the operating cash flows generated during the corresponding periods.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $334.9 million to $96.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $431.8 million in the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a lower aggregate purchase price of acquisitions of $324.0 million and net proceeds related to net working capital adjustments from acquisitions of $8.2 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $431.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we acquired Winroc-SPI, Ken Builder Supply, Inc., or Ken API, Kent Gypsum Supply, Co., Mid America Drywall Supply, Inc. and United Drywall Supply for aggregate consideration of $401.9 million. Cash used for capital expenditures was $30.5 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the 2015 Successor period was $660.3 million and primarily related to $549.3 million used in the Lone Star Acquisition and $103.2 million to acquire Gypsum Supply Co., or GSCIL. Cash used for capital expenditures was $2.8 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the 2015 Predecessor period was $97.3 million and primarily related to $87.5 million used to acquire Oxnard Building Materials, Inc., Great Western Building Materials, Inc. and ProWall Building Products, Inc. (collectively, \"Great Western\"). Cash used for capital expenditures was $9.8 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by, or used in, financing activities consists primarily of borrowings and related repayments under our financing agreements and proceeds from capital contributions.\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $413.8 million to $2.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $416.7 million in the same period in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, IPO proceeds of $164.0 million were used for debt repayments, compared to net borrowings of $350.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $416.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net borrowings of $350.5 million and capital contributions of $66.2 million were used to finance the acquisitions made in 2016 and fund operations.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the 2015 Successor period was $642.7 million, and primarily consisted of net borrowings of $379.8 million to finance the Lone Star Acquisition and capital contributions of $272.9 million, offset by $10.0 million in debt repayments.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the 2015 Predecessor period was $86.6 million was primarily due to financing related to the Great Western acquisition.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017. Some of the amounts included in the table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, our actual payments may vary from those reflected in the table.\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>575,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>575,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TRA liability(1)\n</td> <td>15,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>47,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>33,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>3,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Commitments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>650,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,038,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) The TRA liability at December 31, 2017 was $135.8 million. The first payment in the amount of $15.9 million under the TRA will be made in the fourth quarter of 2018 based on the Company's 2017 tax returns. Payments related to the TRA are expected to be funded through one, or a combination of the following: existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, or availability under the ABL Credit Agreement. The discounted present value of the TRA at December 31, 2017, was estimated to be between $85.0 million and $95.0 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe lease certain facilities and equipment under various operating lease agreements with expiration dates through 2026. These lease agreements typically contain renewal options of five to ten years. Additionally, with the acquisitions of Winroc-SPI and Ken API in 2016, we assumed capital lease obligations with lease terms ranging from five to 15 years.\nABL Credit Facility\nOn August 9, 2016, we entered into the ABL Credit Agreement providing for the ABL Credit Facility, a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, and on September 23, 2016, we entered into an incremental facility amendment to the ABL Credit Facility, increasing the size of the revolving commitments thereunder by $50.0 million. The ABL Credit Facility provides for a $300.0 million revolving credit facility and matures on February 9, 2021. The ABL Credit Facility includes an option to further increase the maximum commitments up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (i) $50.0 million and (ii) such amount as would not cause the total revolving credit commitments under the ABL Credit Facility to exceed the aggregate borrowing base under the ABL Credit Facility by more than $50.0 million, in each case as of the date of such incurrence, subject to the conditions set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement.\nInterest on borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility accrues at a rate equal to LIBOR or Canadian Dollar Offered Rate, or CDOR (as applicable, based on the currency of the borrowing), plus a margin of 1.25% to 1.75% based on average daily excess availability for the most recent fiscal quarter, or if selected by the borrower, ABR or the Canadian prime rate (as applicable, based on the currency of the borrowings) plus a margin of 0.25% to 0.75% based on average daily excess availability for the most recent fiscal quarter, in all such cases subject to an additional 2.0% on overdue amounts during certain default events.\nThe ABL Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, representations and warranties and events of default, including covenants which generally restrict our business and limit our ability to, among other things: dispose of certain assets; incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; enter into new lines of business; make certain investments, intercompany loans or payments in respect of indebtedness; incur or maintain liens; modify certain terms of our or their organizational documents, certain agreements or certain debt instruments; declare or pay dividends or make other restricted payments (including redemption of our stock); engage in certain transactions with affiliates; enter into certain sale leaseback transactions; modify the terms of certain of our existing contractual agreements; and engage in mergers, consolidations or the sale or disposition of substantially all of its assets. The ABL Credit Agreement also includes representations and warranties which we must be able to make in order to obtain borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility, and a financial maintenance covenant and events of default related to, among other things: the non-payment of principal, interest or fees; violations of covenants; material inaccuracy of representations or warranties; failure to timely deliver a borrowing base certificate; certain bankruptcy events; certain events under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; invalidity of guarantees or security interests; default in payment under or the acceleration of other indebtedness; material judgments; and certain change of control events, each of which could result in the facility being terminated and any outstanding debt becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity. The financial maintenance covenant under the ABL Credit Agreement is a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test set at a level of 1.00:1.00, which is based in part on our adjusted EBITDA as calculated pursuant to the ABL Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2017, the fixed charge coverage ratio exceeded the minimum requirement. This covenant is only tested at times when availability under the ABL Credit Facility is less than a certain threshold, which was $30.0 million at December 31, 2017. We were in compliance with all covenants under the ABL Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the majority of our liquidity was from the $252.5 million available under the ABL Credit Facility. The fixed charge coverage ratio is a material term of the ABL Credit Agreement and we believe information about how the covenant is calculated is material to an investor's understanding of the Company's financial condition and liquidity.\nShould we not comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio, we would be in technical default of our ABL Credit Facility which could result in the facility being terminated and any outstanding debt becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity. Should all amounts become due immediately, we may be unable to pay all amounts due under the ABL Credit Facility without a material impact to our business, as we may be forced to liquidate assets to pay for all amounts due under the ABL Credit Facility.\nNotes\nIn August 2016, we completed a private offering of $575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. In the offering we received net proceeds of approximately $563.5 million, which were used in part to repay and terminate the 2015 Credit Facility. The Notes carry a coupon of 8.25% per annum and mature August 15, 2021. The Indenture contains customary covenants, representations and warranties and events of default, including covenants which generally restrict our business and limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, issue certain preferred shares, pay dividends, redeem our stock or make other distributions, make certain investments, limit the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to us or make other intercompany transfers, create liens, sell or transfer certain assets, engage in certain transactions with respect to all or substantially all of our assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates and designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. The Indenture also contains events of default related to, among other things: the non-payment of principal, premium or interest on any Note; violations of any agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture and related documents; certain bankruptcy events; invalidity of guarantees or security interests; default in payment under or the acceleration of other indebtedness; and material judgments, any of which could result in the trustee for the Notes declaring the principal of the Notes together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon to be immediately due and payable. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Indenture as of December 31, 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements or similar obligations, such as financing or unconsolidated variable interest entities.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reported period.\nOn an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates that are more susceptible to change in the near term are the allowance for doubtful accounts, the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory and recoverability of long-lived assets. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when the risks and obligations of ownership have been transferred to the customer, which generally occurs at the time of delivery to the customer. At the time that revenue is recognized we record reductions in sales for customer rebates and discounts including volume, cash and other discounts. Rebates and discounts are recorded based on management's best estimate when products are sold based on historical experience for similar programs and products. Management reviews these rebates and discounts on an ongoing basis and the related accruals are adjusted, if necessary, as additional information becomes available. Historically, our actual customer rebates and discounts have not been materially different from management's original estimates.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe sell to customers using credit terms customary in our industry. Accounts receivables are recorded at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our estimate of credit exposure, determined principally on the basis of our collection experience, aging of our receivables and significant individual account credit risk. If the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance, our operating results would be significantly adversely affected.\nOther Receivables\nOther receivables primarily consist of vendor rebates receivables. Typical arrangements with vendors provide for us to receive a rebate of a specified amount after achieving any of a number of measures generally related to the volume of purchases over a period of time. We record these rebates to effectively reduce the cost of sales in the period in which the product is sold. Throughout the year, our estimates include the amount of rebates receivable for the vendor programs based on the expected level of purchases. We accrue for vendor rebates earned based on purchase volumes and adjust inventories to reflect the reduction in the cost basis for inventories purchased that are subject to vendor"}
