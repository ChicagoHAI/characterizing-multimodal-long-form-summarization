Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as of, and for, the periods presented. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding industry outlook, our expectations for the future of our business, and our liquidity and capital resources as well as other non-historical statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties described in Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nCeridian is a global HCM software company. We categorize our solutions into two categories: Cloud and Bureau solutions. Cloud revenue is generated from HCM solutions that are delivered via two cloud offerings: Dayforce, our flagship cloud HCM platform, and Powerpay, a cloud HR and payroll solution for the Canadian small business market. We also continue to support customers using our Bureau solutions, which we generally stopped actively selling to new customers following the acquisition of Dayforce in 2012. We invest in maintenance and necessary updates to support our Bureau customers and continue to migrate them to Dayforce.\nDayforce provides HR, payroll, benefits, workforce management, and talent management functionality. Our platform is used by organizations, regardless of industry or size, to optimize management of the entire employee lifecycle, including attracting, engaging, paying, deploying, and developing their people. Dayforce was built as a single application from the ground up that combines a modern, consumer-grade user experience with proprietary application architecture, including a single employee record and a rules engine spanning all areas of HCM. Dayforce provides continuous real-time calculations across all modules to enable, for example, payroll administrators access to data through the entire pay period, and managers access to real-time data to optimize work schedules. Our platform is designed to make work life better for our customers and their employees by improving HCM decision-making processes, streamlining workflows, exposing strategic organizational insights, and simplifying legislative compliance. The platform is designed to ease administrative work for both employees and managers, creating opportunities for companies to increase employee engagement. We are a founder-led organization, and our culture combines the agility and innovation of a start-up with a history of deep domain and operational expertise.\nWe sell Dayforce through our direct sales force on a subscription per-employee, per-month ( PEPM\u201d) basis. Our subscriptions are typically structured with an initial fixed term of between three and five years, with evergreen renewal thereafter. Dayforce can serve customers of all sizes, ranging from 100 to over 100,000 employees. We have rapidly grown the Dayforce platform to more than 3,700 live Dayforce customers, representing approximately 3.1 million active global users as of December 31, 2018. In 2018, we added over 715 net new live Dayforce customers. Our customers vary across industries, and no single customer constituted more than 1% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. We have experienced significant Cloud revenue growth at scale, particularly from Dayforce, which has grown at a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR\u201d) of more than 55% since 2012. Our annual Cloud revenue retention rate continues to exceed 95% due to our intense focus on solving complex problems and our superior customer experience.\nThe following table presents Dayforce revenue by quarter from 2012 to 2018.\nOur Business Model\nOur business model focuses on supporting the rapid growth of Dayforce and maximizing the lifetime value of our Dayforce customer relationships. Due to our subscription model, where we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period, and high customer retention rates, we have a high level of visibility into our future revenues. The profitability of a customer to our business depends, in large part, on how long they have been a customer. Because in our current business model, PEPM subscription fees are not charged until the customer goes live, and because we incur costs in advance of receiving PEPM revenue that are not offset by our implementation fees, we estimate that it takes an average of 2.5 years before we are able to recover our implementation, customer acquisition, and other direct costs on a new Dayforce customer contract. As the proportion of Dayforce customers who have been live for two or more years increases, our related profitability increases. The following sets forth the number of live Dayforce customers at the end of each quarter presented:\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December\n31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September\n30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June\n30,2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March\n31,2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December\n31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September\n30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June\n30,2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March\n31,2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December\n31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September\n30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June\n30,2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March\n31,2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Live Dayforce\ncustomers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dayforce\ncustomers live\nfor two or\nmore years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proportion\nof Dayforce\ncustomers live\nfor two or\nmore years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOver the lifetime of the customer relationship, we have the opportunity to realize additional PEPM revenue, both as the customer grows or rolls out the Dayforce solution to additional employees, and also by selling additional functionality to existing customers that do not currently utilize our full platform. We also incur costs to manage the account, to retain customers, and to sell additional functionality. These costs, however, are significantly less than the costs initially incurred to acquire and to implement the customer.\nHow We Assess Our Performance\nIn assessing our performance, we consider a variety of performance indicators in addition to revenue and net income. Set forth below is a description of our key performance measures.\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Live Dayforce customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Annual Cloud revenue retention rate (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cloud annualized recurring revenue (ARR) (a)\n(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 506.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 391.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 289.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA (b) (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 157.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Annual Cloud revenue retention rate and Cloud annualized recurring revenue are calculated on an annual basis, and the disclosure reflects data as of the most recent fiscal year end.

As shown in the following table, the number of customers live on Dayforce has increased from 482 as of December 31, 2012 to 3,718 as of December 31, 2018. In addition, we had over 450 net new Dayforce customers contracted, but not yet live on Dayforce as of December 31, 2018. We expect the majority of these Dayforce customers to be taken live in 2019. For 2018, our 3,718 live Dayforce customers represented over 3.1 million active users. We market Dayforce to customers of all sizes, including small (under 500 employees), mid-sized (501 to 2,500 employees), and enterprise (over 2,500 employees). For 2018, small businesses accounted for 14% of the total number of active customer employees, mid-sized businesses accounted for 32% of the total number of active customer employees, and enterprise businesses accounted for 54% of the total number of active customer employees. As our business and go-to-market strategy continues to evolve, in 2019, we will be modifying our customer segmentation for increased relevance.\nFrom 2017 to 2018, live Dayforce customers increased from 3,001 to 3,718, a net increase of 717. Of the customers taken live during 2018, 77% represented net new customers to Dayforce, and the remainder were migration customers from our Bureau solution. Of the net new customers to Dayforce, small businesses accounted for 9% of the total number of active customer employees, mid-sized businesses accounted for 33% of the total number of active customer employees, and enterprise businesses accounted for 58% of the total number of active customer employees. Of the migration customers, small businesses accounted for 23% of the total number of active customer employees, mid-sized businesses accounted for 41% of the total number of active customer employees, and enterprise businesses accounted for 36% of the total number of active customer employees.\nFrom 2016 to 2017, live Dayforce customers increased from 2,339 to 3,001, a net increase of 662. Of the customers taken live during 2017, 58% represented net new customers to Dayforce and the remainder were migration customers from our Bureau solutions. Of the net new customers to Dayforce, small businesses accounted for 13% of the total number of active customer employees, mid-sized businesses accounted for 33% of the total number of active customer employees, and enterprise businesses accounted for 54% of the total number of active customer employees. Of the migration customers, small businesses accounted for 20% of the total number of active customer employees, mid-sized businesses accounted for 48% of the total number of active customer employees, and enterprise businesses accounted for 32% of the total number of active customer employees.\nThe following table sets forth the number of live Dayforce customers at the end of the years presented:\nAnnual Cloud Revenue Retention Rate\nOur annual Cloud revenue retention rate measures the percentage of revenues that we retain from our existing Cloud customers. We use this retention rate as an indicator of customer satisfaction and future revenues. We calculate the annual Cloud revenue retention rate as a percentage, where the numerator is the Cloud annualized recurring revenue for the prior year, less the Cloud annualized recurring revenue from lost Cloud customers during that year; and the denominator is the Cloud annualized recurring revenue for the prior year. Our annual Cloud revenue retention rate has been 95% or above for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. We set annual targets for Cloud revenue retention rate and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis by reviewing known and anticipated customer losses. Our Cloud revenue retention rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the mix of Cloud solutions used by customers, the level of customer satisfaction, and changes in the number of users live on our Cloud solutions.\nCloud Annualized Recurring Revenue ( ARR\u201d)\nWe derive the majority of our Cloud revenues from recurring fees, primarily PEPM subscription charges. We also derive recurring revenue from fees related to the rental and maintenance of clocks, charges for once-a-year services, such as year-end tax statements, and investment income on our customer funds held in trust before such funds are remitted to taxing authorities, customer employees, or other third parties. To calculate Cloud ARR, we start with recurring revenue at year end, subtract the once-a-year charges, annualize the revenue for customers live for less than a full year to reflect the revenue that would have been realized if the customer had been live for a full year, and add back the once-a-year charges. We set annual targets for Cloud ARR and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP financial measures, are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are components of our management incentive plan and are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as adjusted to exclude net income or loss from discontinued operations, sponsor management fees, non-cash charges for asset impairments, gains or losses on assets and liabilities held in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of a company subsidiary, share-based compensation expense, severance charges, restructuring consulting fees, transaction costs, and environmental reserve charges. Adjusted EBITDA margin is determined by calculating the percentage Adjusted EBITDA is of Total Revenue. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin exclude the results of decisions that are outside the normal course of our business operations. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating profit, please see Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d\nOur History\nCeridian was acquired in 2007 by affiliates and co-investors of the Sponsors. In April 2012, Ceridian acquired Dayforce Corporation, which had built Dayforce, a cloud HCM solution. In the months following the acquisition, Dayforce founder, David D. Ossip, was named Chief Executive Officer of Ceridian HCM, and shortly thereafter, we generally stopped actively selling our Bureau solutions to new customers in the United States to focus our resources on expanding the Dayforce platform and growing Cloud solutions. For each quarter since September 30, 2016, our Cloud revenue has surpassed our Bureau revenue. Cloud revenue grew from 39% of total revenue during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 to 74% of total revenue during the quarter ended December 31, 2018.\nAs part of our strategy to focus on the growth of our Cloud solutions business, we undertook the following initiatives to simplify our business model:\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (i)\n</td> <td> sold our consumer-directed benefit services business in 2013,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (ii)\n</td> <td> merged Comdata, our payment systems business unit, with FleetCor Technologies in 2014,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (iii)\n</td> <td> sold our benefits administration and post-employment compliance business in 2015,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (iv)\n</td> <td> sold our United Kingdom and Ireland Bureau businesses and a portion of our operations that supported such businesses in Mauritius in 2016, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (v)\n</td> <td> contributed our LifeWorks employee assistance program business to a joint venture, LifeWorks, in 2016, then distributed our ownership in this joint venture to a holding company owned by our stockholders in April 2018 (the LifeWorks Disposition\u201d).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of these transactions, we only actively sell Dayforce and Powerpay, which we believe simplifies our business model and positions us well for continued growth.\nOur benefits administration and post-employee compliance business, our United Kingdom and Ireland businesses, our divested Mauritius operations, and our LifeWorks joint venture are presented as discontinued operations in our financial statements. Our consumer-directed benefits services business and our benefits administration and post-employment compliance business are collectively referred to as our Divested Benefits Businesses.\u201d After the LifeWorks Disposition, management has concluded that we have one operating and reportable segment. This conclusion aligns with how management monitors operating performance, allocates resources, and deploys capital. Please refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these transactions.\nOn April 30, 2018, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold 21,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. We granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase an additional 3,150,000 shares of common stock at the offering price, which was exercised in full. A total of 24,150,000 shares of common stock were issued on April 30, 2018, with gross proceeds of $531.3 million from the IPO before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses. Immediately subsequent to the closing of our IPO on April 30, 2018, THL / Cannae Investors LLC, one of our existing stockholders controlled by our Sponsors, purchased from us in a private placement $100.0 million of our common stock at a price per share equal to the offering price. Based on the offering price of $22.00 per share, 4,545,455 shares were issued in this private placement. Please refer to Note 1, Organization,\u201d for further discussion of the IPO transaction.\nWe applied a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to satisfy and to discharge the indenture governing our outstanding $475.0 million principal amount Senior Notes, and they were redeemed on May 30, 2018. Concurrently, we also refinanced our remaining debt under our (i) $702.0 million (original principal amount) Senior Term Debt and (ii) $130.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, including accrued interest and related costs and expenses, with new senior credit facilities consisting of a $680.0 million term loan debt facility and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility. Please refer to Note 9, Debt,\u201d for further discussion of the debt transactions.\nThe IPO, private placement, and debt refinancing had the following impacts to our results of operations and cash during 2018:\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Impacts to\nStatement of\nOperations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Impact to Cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross proceeds from the IPO and private placement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 631.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs capitalized within stockholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (36.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Redemption of Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (475.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt refinancing fees, reflected as a reduction to long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> IPO and debt refinancing related expenses reflected\nwithin results of operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general, and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact on operating profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact on net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (51.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (51.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash IPO-related share-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash interest expense adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash to balance sheet from the IPO and private placement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from issuance of the new $680.0 million Senior Term Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 680.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repayment of the $702.0 million Senior Term Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (657.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash to balance sheet from the IPO, private placement, and\ndebt refinancing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 91.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn November 16, 2018, we completed a secondary offering, in which certain of our stockholders (the Selling Stockholders\u201d) sold 11,000,000 shares of common stock, in an underwritten public offering at $36.00 per share. The Selling Stockholders granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase an additional 1,650,000 shares of common stock at the offering price, which was exercised in full. A total of 12,650,000 shares of common stock were sold by the Selling Stockholders on November 16, 2018, with all proceeds going to the Selling Stockholders. We incurred expenses of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, related to the secondary offering within selling, general, and administrative expense.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe generate recurring revenues primarily from recurring fees charged for the use of our Cloud solutions, Dayforce and Powerpay, as well as from our Bureau solutions. We also generate professional services and other revenue associated primarily with the work performed to assist customers with the planning, design, implementation, and staging of their cloud-based solution. Our solutions are typically provided through long-term customer relationships that result in a high level of recurring revenue. We also generate recurring services revenue from investment income on our Cloud and Bureau customer funds held in trust before such funds are remitted to taxing authorities, customer employees, or other third parties. We refer to this investment income as float revenue.\nFor Dayforce, we primarily charge monthly recurring fees on a PEPM basis, generally one-month in advance of service, based on the number and type of solutions provided to the customer and the number of employees and other users at the customer. Our standard Dayforce contracts are generally for a three to five-year period. The average time it takes to implement Dayforce typically ranges from three months for smaller customers to nine months for larger customers. Once Dayforce is implemented, the customer goes live, and we begin to generate recurring revenue. We also provide outsourced human resource solutions to certain of our Dayforce customers, which are tailored to meet their individual needs, and entail performing the duties of a customer's human resources department, including payroll processing, time and labor management, performance management, and recruiting, as needed.\nThe Powerpay offering is our solution designed primarily for small market Canadian customers. The typical Powerpay customer has fewer than 20 employees, and the majority of the revenue is generated from recurring fees charged on a per-employee, per-process basis. Typical processes include the customer's payroll runs, year-end tax packages, and delivery of customers' remittance advices or checks. Powerpay can typically be implemented on a remote basis within one to three days, at which point we start receiving recurring fees.\nFor our Bureau solutions, we typically charge recurring fees on a per-process basis. Typical processes include the customer's payroll runs, year-end tax packages, and delivery of customers' remittance advices or checks. In addition to customers who use our payroll services, certain customers use our tax filing services on a stand-alone basis. Our outsourced human resource solutions are tailored to meet the needs of individual customers, and entail our contracting to perform many of the duties of a customer's human resources department, including payroll processing, time and labor management, performance management, and recruiting. We also perform individual services for customers, such as check printing, wage attachment and disbursement, and ACA management.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of costs to deliver our solutions. Most of these costs are recognized as incurred. Some costs of revenue are recognized in the period that a service is sold and delivered. Other costs of revenue are recognized over the period of use or in proportion to the related revenue.\nThe costs recognized as incurred consist primarily of customer service staff costs, customer technical support costs, implementation personnel costs, costs of hosting applications, consulting and purchased services, delivery services, and royalties. The costs of revenue recognized over the period of use are depreciation and amortization, rentals of facilities and equipment, and direct and incremental costs associated with deferred implementation service revenue.\nCost of recurring services revenues primarily consists of costs to provide maintenance and technical support to our customers and the costs of hosting our applications. The cost of recurring services revenues also includes compensation and other employee-related expenses for data center staff, payments to outside service providers, data center expenses, and networking expenses.\nCost of professional services and other revenues primarily consists of costs to provide implementation consulting services and training to our customers, as well as the cost of time clocks. Costs to provide implementation consulting services include compensation and other employee-related expenses for professional services staff, costs of subcontractors, and travel. Implementation consulting services are expected to continue to be primarily associated with the implementation of our Cloud solutions.\nProduct development and management expense, included in cost of revenue, consists of costs related to software development activities that do not qualify for capitalization, such as development, quality assurance, testing of new technologies, and enhancements to our existing solutions that do not result in additional functionality. Product development and management expense also includes costs related to the management of our solutions.\nDepreciation and amortization related to cost of revenue primarily consists of amortization of capitalized software.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expense\nSelling expense includes costs related to maintaining a direct marketing infrastructure and sales force and other direct marketing efforts, such as marketing events, advertising, telemarketing, direct mail, and trade shows. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Our sales and marketing expenses are expected to continue to be primarily associated with selling and marketing our Cloud solutions.\nGeneral and administrative expense includes costs that are not directly related to delivery of services, selling efforts, or product development and management, primarily consisting of corporate-level costs, such as administration, finance, legal, and human resources, as well as management fees payable to affiliates of our Sponsors, FNF and THLM, until termination of the management agreements upon IPO in April 2018. Also included in this category are depreciation, and amortization of other intangible assets not reflected in cost of revenue, the provision for doubtful accounts receivable, and net periodic pension costs.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net includes the results of transactions that are not appropriately classified in another category. These items include certain foreign currency translation gains and losses resulting mainly from intercompany receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary's functional currency, environmental reserve charges, and charges related to the impairment of asset values.\nIncome Tax Provision\nOur income tax provision represents federal, state, and international taxes on our income recognized for financial statement purposes and includes the effects of temporary differences between financial statement income and income recognized for tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as adjusted for the expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to reflect the net deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized. In assessing the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of pre-tax book income, expiration of net operating losses, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, as well as current tax laws. As of December 31, 2018, we continue to record a full valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets that are not offset by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities. In the future, if it is determined that we no longer have a requirement to record a valuation allowance against all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, the release of the valuation allowance would have a positive impact on our income tax provision.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act legislation (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted. The Tax Act amended the Code to reduce tax rates and to modify policies, credits, and deductions for businesses. For businesses, the Tax Act reduced the corporate federal tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31,

This increase was primarily driven by an increase in Cloud revenue of $130.0 million, or 32.2% from $404.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $534.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Cloud revenue increase was primarily due to an increase of $106.9 million, or 31.8%, in Cloud recurring services revenue, and $23.1 million, or 33.9%, in Cloud professional services and other revenue. The increase in Cloud recurring services revenue of $106.9 million was attributable to increases of $76.0 million from new customers, add-ons, and revenue uplift from migrations of Bureau customers; $22.9 million from the migration of Bureau customers; and $20.0 million from increased float revenue related to Cloud recurring services revenue, partially offset by customer attrition of $12.0 million. The increase in Cloud revenue was partially offset by a decline in Bureau revenue of $54.4 million, or 20.4%. There was an immaterial impact on revenue due to changes in foreign currency rate fluctuations. Please refer to the table above for our revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis.\nOf the decline in Bureau revenue, approximately 58% was driven by customer attrition and approximately 42% was attributable to customer migrations to Dayforce. Excluding the impact of migrations, our annual Bureau revenue retention rate was 86.9% in 2018 and 89.7% in 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, recurring services revenue from payroll Bureau customers accounted for $161.2 million, and tax-only Bureau recurring services revenue accounted for $48.2 million. The payroll Bureau customers consist of approximately 1.5 million active users, of which approximately 1.4 million are customers that we believe could be candidates for migration to Dayforce. Some of our customers are not candidates to migrate to Dayforce due to a variety of factors, including the type of functionality that they require and their system configuration. Of the approximately 1.4 million active users that we believe could be candidates for migration to Dayforce, small businesses accounted for 21% of the total number of active users, mid-sized businesses accounted for 28% of the total number of active users, and enterprise businesses accounted for 51% of the total number of active users.\nCloud revenue by solution. The following table presents our Cloud revenue for both recurring and professional services and other, for both our Dayforce and Powerpay solution for the periods presented.\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Growth rate\nyear-over-\nyear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Growth rate\non a constant\ncurrency\nbasis\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dayforce\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 443.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 319.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Powerpay\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Cloud Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 534.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 404.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCloud revenue was $534.3 million for 2018, an increase of 32.2% when compared to 2017. Dayforce revenue grew 38.5%, and Powerpay revenue grew 8.2% in 2018 as compared to 2017. There was an immaterial impact on revenue due to changes in foreign currency rate fluctuations. Please refer to the table above for our revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis. Our new business sales to Dayforce and Powerpay customers comprised 82% of our increase in Cloud revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the remaining 18% consisted primarily of customer migration to Dayforce from our Bureau solutions. As we migrate our Bureau customers to Dayforce, we typically experience a revenue increase from such customers driven by increased product density on the Dayforce platform. This revenue increase can vary by customer, but has been 22% on average since 2016, as measured at the time of initial migration.\nFloat revenue. Investment income from invested customer trust funds included in revenue was $67.0 million and $46.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The average float balance for our customer trust funds for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3,361.5 million, compared to $3,228.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The average yield was 2.00% during the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 55 basis points compared to the average yield for the year ended December 31, 2017. Based on current investment practices, an increase in market investment rates of 100 basis points would increase float revenue by approximately $17 million over the twelve months following a rate increase. In addition to interest rate risks, we also have exposure to risks associated with changes in laws and regulations that may affect customer fund balances. For example, a change in regulations, either reducing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities, would reduce our average customer trust fund balances and float revenue. There are no incremental costs of revenue associated with increases or declines in float revenue.\nCost of revenue. Total cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $425.8 million, an increase of $18.3 million, or 4.5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Of the total $18.3 million increase, $2.1 million was attributable to IPO-related share-based compensation expense. Excluding IPO-related items, cost of revenue increased $16.2 million.\nRecurring services cost of revenue increased by $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due to additional costs incurred to support the growing Dayforce customer base, partially offset by reductions in costs to support our Bureau customers.\nThe reduction in cost of revenue for professional services and other of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to productivity improvements in implementing new customers.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 350, we are required to capitalize certain software development costs. Please refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d for further discussion of our accounting policy for internally developed software costs. Costs related to software development activities that do not qualify for capitalization, such as development, quality assurance, testing of new technologies, enhancements to our existing solutions that do not result in additional functionality, and costs related to the management of our solutions are presented as product development and management expense. The increase in product development and management expense of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, reflects increases in Dayforce product development efforts. For the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, our investment in software development was $54.9 million and $45.0 million, respectively, consisting of $29.6 million and $19.0 million of research and development expense, which is included within product development and management expense, and $25.3 million and $26.0 million of capitalized software development, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization expense associated with cost of revenue increased by $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, as we continue to capitalize Dayforce related and other development costs and subsequently amortize those costs.\nThe table below presents total gross margin and solution gross margins for the periods presented:\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin by solution:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cloud recurring services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bureau recurring services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional services and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (40.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (87.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal gross margin is defined as total gross profit as a percentage of total revenue, inclusive of product development and management costs as well as depreciation and amortization associated with cost of revenue. Gross margin for each solution in the table above is defined as total revenue less cost of revenue for the applicable solution as a percentage of total revenue for that related solution, exclusive of any product development and management or depreciation and amortization cost allocations.\nThe overall 11.3% increase in revenue outpaced the 4.5% increase in cost of revenue, and gross profit increased by $57.3 million, or 21.8%, as we continued to leverage our investment in people and processes to realize economies of scale.\nCloud recurring services gross margin was 68.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 62.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in Cloud recurring services gross margin reflects an increase in the proportion of Dayforce customers live for more than two years, which increased from 59% as of December 31, 2017 to 63% as of December 31, 2018, and was also attributable to consistent configuration of new customers, which enabled us to realize economies of scale in customer support and hosting costs. Professional services and other gross margin was (40.8)% for the year ended December 31, 2018, improving from (87.8)% for the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting an increase in profitable post go-live professional services and productivity improvements in implementing new customers.\nSelling, general, and administrative expense. Selling, general, and administrative expense increased $47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Of the total $47.7 million increase, $24.5 million was attributable to transaction expenses associated with our IPO, debt refinancing, and secondary offering, including $11.3 million in sponsor management termination fees, $6.0 million in IPO-related share-based compensation expense, $3.7 million in other IPO transactions costs, and $3.5 million in restructuring consulting expenses. Excluding transaction-related items, selling, general, and administrative expense increased $23.2 million, primarily due to sales and marketing expense, which increased by $13.4 million. We continue to invest in our sales and marketing efforts, as we drive growth in our Cloud solutions, particularly in Dayforce. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses also reflected increases in employee related costs and increased costs associated with being a public company.\nOther (income) expense, net. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $2.9 million of other income, net, compared to $7.3 million of other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The other (income) expense, net, for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, was primarily related to remeasurement gains and losses an intercompany payable denominated in a foreign currency, which was repaid in the second quarter of 2018.\nOperating profit. We realized operating profit of $52.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to an operating profit of $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Excluding the impact of $24.5 million in transaction costs within selling, general, and administrative expense, and $2.1 million in other increased share-based compensation expense related to the IPO within cost of revenue, operating profit would have been $79.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This $46.4 million increase was primarily due to a $75.6 million increase in revenue and gross margin improvement.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $83.2 million, compared to $87.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This reduction was primarily due to the refinancing of our debt, which resulted in a reduction in interest expense of $30.6 million upon the extinguishment of the Senior Notes in April 2018, representing seven fewer months of interest on the Senior Notes as compared to the prior year, partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt of $25.7 million. As of December 31, 2018, a 100 point basis increase in the London Inter-bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) rates would result in an approximately $7 million increase in our interest expense over the ensuring twelve-month period. Please refer to Note 9, Debt,\u201d for additional information.\nIncome tax expense. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had income tax expense of $7.7 million, compared to income tax benefit of $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $57.3 million increase in tax expense is primarily attributable to the $59.4 million tax benefit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities upon the initial implementation of the Tax Act.\nLoss from discontinued operations. As a result of the LifeWorks Disposition, the financial results of the LifeWorks business have been included within discontinued operations for all periods presented. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had a loss from discontinued operations of $25.8 million, compared to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, is primarily related to income tax expense incurred as a result of the LifeWorks Disposition.\nNet loss attributable to Ceridian. Net loss attributable to Ceridian was $63.4 for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to $52.3 million of expenses incurred related to our IPO, debt refinancing, and secondary offering transactions, partially offset by an increase in gross profit. Net loss attributable to Ceridian was $9.2 for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a tax benefit of approximately $59.4 million related to the 2017 tax reform legislation. Please refer to the Our History\u201d section above for additional information on the financial statement impacts of our IPO, debt refinancing, and secondary offering transactions.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, and Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 21.0% in 2018 from 17.6% in 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented.\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

This increase was primarily driven by an increase in Cloud revenue of $106.5 million, or 35.8%, from $297.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $404.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Cloud revenue increase was driven by an increase of $96.7 million, or 40.4%, in Cloud recurring services revenue, and $9.8 million, or 16.8%, in Cloud professional services and other revenue. The increase in Cloud recurring services revenue of $96.7 million was due to $68.0 million from new customers, add-ons, and revenue uplift from migrations of Bureau customers; $28.1 million from the migration of Bureau customers; $10.0 million from increased float revenue related to Cloud recurring services revenue; partially offset by customer losses of $9.4 million. The increase in Cloud revenue was partially offset by a decline in Bureau recurring services revenue of $56.7 million, or 17.8%.\nOn a constant currency basis, total revenue grew 6.8%. This adjusted revenue growth was driven by an increase of 34.5% in Cloud revenue, partially offset by a decline of 18.6% in Bureau revenue. On a constant currency basis, Cloud revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was driven by Cloud recurring services revenue, which increased by 39.0%, and professional services and other revenue, which increased by 15.9%, as we continued to sign and to activate new customers.\nOf the decline in Bureau revenue, approximately 50% was driven by customer attrition and approximately 50% was driven by customer migrations to Dayforce. Excluding the impact of migrations, our annual Bureau revenue retention rate was 89.7% in 2017 and 87.4% in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, recurring services revenue from payroll Bureau customers accounted for $210.2 million and tax-only Bureau recurring services revenue accounted for $52.1 million. The payroll Bureau customers consist of approximately 1.9 million active users, of which approximately 1.7 million of these active users are with customers that we believe could be candidates for migration to Dayforce. Some of our customers are not candidates to migrate to Dayforce due to a variety of factors, including the type of functionality that they require and their system configuration. Of the approximately 1.7 million active users, small businesses accounted for 20% of the total number of active users, mid-sized businesses accounted for 30% of the total number of active users, and enterprise businesses accounted for 50% of the total number of active users.\nCloud revenue by solution. The following table presents our Cloud revenue for both recurring and professional services and other, for both our Dayforce and Powerpay solution for the periods presented.\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Growth rate\nyear-over-\nyear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Growth rate\non a constant\ncurrency\nbasis\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dayforce\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 319.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 219.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Powerpay\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Cloud Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 404.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 297.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCloud revenue was $404.3 million during 2017, an increase of 35.8% when compared to 2016. Dayforce revenue grew 46.1%, and Powerpay revenue grew 7.1% during 2017 as compared to 2016. Our new business sales to Dayforce customers comprised 74% of our increase in Cloud revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, and the remaining 26% consisted primarily of customer migration to Dayforce from our Bureau solutions.\nFloat revenue. Investment income from invested customer trust funds included in revenue was $46.5 million and $39.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The average float balance for our customer trust funds for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $3,228.2 million, compared to $3,260.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The yield was 1.44% during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 24 basis points compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition to interest rate risks, we also have exposure to risks associated with changes in laws and regulations that may affect customer fund balances. For example, a change in regulations, either reducing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities, would reduce our average customer trust fund balances and float revenue. There are no incremental costs of revenue associated with increases or declines in float revenue.\nCost of revenue. Total cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $407.5 million, an increase of $11.1 million, or 2.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDuring 2017, we changed the presentation and classification of certain expenses within our statements of operations to better facilitate comparisons with revenue and expenses of similar businesses, to better align our income statement presentation with the way management and reporting of our business has evolved internally, and to enhance our overall disclosure and understanding of the business for external users. We reallocated certain expenses between cost of recurring services revenue, cost of professional services and other revenue, and selling, general, and administrative expense. The net impact of these reallocations was to increase total cost of revenue by $3.4 million and to reduce selling, general, and administrative expense by $3.4 million. These changes in presentation and classification represent a change in estimate and have been accounted for on a prospective basis. Therefore, to facilitate the discussion in this section, the following table presents the actual reported costs and expenses as well as the costs and expenses on a pro forma basis as if the changes to allocation methodologies in 2017 had been in effect in 2016:\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pro Forma\nIncrease (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPro Forma\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recurring services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 196.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 214.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 182.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional services and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 135.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 115.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 138.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product development and management\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 407.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 396.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 399.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general, and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 223.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 225.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 221.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in total cost of revenue for year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, included a net reallocation of $3.4 million from selling, general, and administrative expense due to a change in estimate of expense allocations. Excluding the effect of these reallocations, total cost of revenue would have increased by $7.7 million, or 1.9%.\nRecurring services cost of revenue was reduced by $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This reduction included a reallocation of $31.5 million of costs from recurring services cost of revenue, consisting primarily of $13.4 million in technology and facilities expenses, $10.9 million in finance related expenses, and $9.3 million in corporate function expenses. Excluding the effect of these reallocations, recurring services cost of revenue would have increased by $13.9 million due to additional costs incurred to support the growing Dayforce customer base, partially offset by reductions in Bureau costs.\nThe increase in cost of revenue for professional services and other of $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, included a net reallocation of $23.1 million of costs to professional services and other cost of revenue, primarily $23.2 million of technology and facilities expenses. Excluding the effect of these reallocations, professional services and other cost of revenue would have been reduced by $2.9 million, as we achieved productivity improvements in implementing new customers.\nThe increase in product development and management expense of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, included the reallocation of $3.6 million of costs to product development and management, primarily $7.9 million in technology and facilities expenses, offset by $2.8 million in corporate function expenses. Excluding the effect of these reallocations, product development and management expense would have been reduced by $3.3 million, due to reductions in product management costs associated with our Bureau solution and technology expenses, partially offset by higher headcount to support the continued development of the Dayforce platform.\nDepreciation and amortization expense associated with cost of revenue increased by $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the effect of these reallocations of $8.2 million, depreciation and amortization expense would have been consistent with 2016.\nThe table below presents total gross margin and solution gross margins for the periods presented, both as presented and on a pro forma basis as if the changes to allocation methodologies of certain costs in 2017 discussed above had been in effect in 2016.\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPro Forma\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin by solution:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cloud recurring services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bureau recurring services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional services and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (87.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (78.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (113.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general, and administrative expense. Selling, general, and administrative expense was reduced by $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This reduction included the reallocation of $3.4 million of costs. Excluding the effect of these reallocations, selling, general, and administrative expense would have increased by $1.1 million, reflecting increases in sales and marketing expenses and share-based compensation expense, partially offset by reductions in restructuring consulting fees, severance expense, sponsor management fees and other cost reduction measures related to our declining Bureau solutions.\nOther expense, net. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred $7.3 million of other expense, net, compared to $12.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily related to foreign currency remeasurement losses on intercompany receivables or payables denominated in foreign currencies. The other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily related to an impairment of $10.2 million to our trade name intangible asset and an increase of $5.9 million to our environmental reserve liability to reflect more stringent remediation requirements, partially offset by foreign currency remeasurement gains on intercompany receivables or payables denominated in foreign currencies. Please refer to Note 12, Supplementary Data to Statement of Operations,\u201d for further discussion.\nOperating profit (loss). We realized operating profit of $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to an operating loss of $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This $44.2 million increase was primarily due to a $47.4 million increase in revenue and gross margin improvement.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $87.1 million, compared to $87.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had an income tax benefit of $49.6 million, compared to income tax expense of $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily related to a tax benefit of approximately $59.4 million related to the 2017 tax reform legislation, of which $26.4 million was attributable to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and $33.0 million was attributable to the reduction in our valuation allowance.\n(Loss) income from discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had a loss from discontinued operations of $6.0 million, compared to income from discontinued operation of $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily related to our LifeWorks business. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily attributable to proceeds of $10.7 million from our Divested Benefits Businesses, net of tax, which were sold in a series of transactions in the third quarter of 2015, and our United Kingdom business, which was sold in the second quarter of 2016, resulting in a gain on sale of $5.9 million.\nNet loss attributable to Ceridian. Net loss attributable to Ceridian improved by $83.7 million to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, and Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 17.6% in 2017 from 13.7% in 2016.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth statements of operations data for each of the quarters presented. We have prepared the quarterly statements of operations data on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the financial information reflects all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data. This information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes. The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td>

activities, borrowings under our credit facilities, and proceeds from equity offerings. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and equivalents of $217.8 million and availability under our revolving credit facility of $300.0 million. No cash amounts were drawn on the revolving credit facility during 2018. Our total indebtedness was $678.3 million as of December 31, 2018. Please refer to Note 9, Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements, for further information on our debt.\nOur primary liquidity needs are related to funding of general business requirements, including the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and product development.\nOur customer trust funds are held and invested with the primary objectives being to protect the principal balance and to ensure adequate liquidity to meet cash flow requirements. Accordingly, we maintain on average approximately 46% of customer trust funds in liquidity portfolios with maturities ranging from one to 120 days, consisting of high-quality bank deposits, money market mutual funds, commercial paper, or collateralized short-term investments; and we maintain on average approximately 54% of customer trust funds in fixed income portfolios with maturities ranging from 120 days to 10 years, consisting of U.S. Treasury and agency securities, Canada government and provincial securities, as well as highly rated asset-backed, mortgage-backed, municipal, corporate and bank securities. To maintain sufficient liquidity in the trust to meet payment obligations, we also have financing arrangements and may pledge fixed income securities for short-term financing. The assets held in trust are intended for the specific purpose of satisfying client fund obligations and therefore are not freely available for our general business use.\nWe believe that our cash flow from operations, availability under our revolving credit facility, and available cash and equivalents will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the issuance of equity, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, or a combination thereof. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms, or at all. Additionally, our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and to fund our capital requirements are also dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, and other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available from additional indebtedness or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs. Although we have no specific current plans to do so, if we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions, which would result in additional expenses or dilution.\nStatements of Cash Flows\nChanges in cash flows due to purchases of customer trust fund marketable securities, proceeds from the sale or maturity of customer trust fund marketable securities, and the net increase (decrease) of restricted cash held to satisfy customer trust fund obligations, as well as the carrying value of customer trust fund accounts as of period end dates can vary significantly due to several factors, including the specific day of the week the period ends, which impacts the timing of funds collected from customers and payments made to satisfy customer obligations to employees, taxing authorities, and others. For example, December 31, 2018 was a Monday, when trust fund balances are generally lower; whereas, the last business day of 2017 was a Friday, when trust fund balances are generally higher. The customer trust funds are fully segregated from our operating cash accounts and are evaluated and tracked separately by management. Therefore, to provide meaningful information to the readers, the following discussion is regarding the net cash flows excluding customer trust funds.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of $10.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily attributable to operating profit of $52.8 million, partially offset by a $45.0 million reduction in cash as a result of net changes in working capital. The $45.0 million reduction in net working capital was primarily attributable to a reduction of $22.1 million in liabilities for employee compensation and benefits, primarily due to payments of accrued incentive compensation and pension contributions, and a $15.7 million reduction in liabilities for accrued interest, associated with our debt refinancing. Included within net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $74.5 million in cash interest payments on our long-term debt, $18.5 million in pension payments, and $16.7 million in cash taxes, net of refunds received.\nNet cash used in operating activities from continuing operations of $29.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily attributable to operating losses of $4.5 million, net changes in working capital of $37.2 million, and a deferred tax benefit of $62.3 million, partially offset by certain non-cash items, primarily $53.8 million of depreciation and amortization and $16.1 million of share-based compensation expense. Net changes in working capital were driven by employee compensation and benefits, primarily pension contributions, accrued taxes, and prepaid expenses.\nNet cash used in operating activities from continuing operations of $73.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily attributable to operating losses of $105.3 million with offsetting adjustments for certain non-cash items and net changes in working capital. The adjustments for non-cash items included $53.2 million of depreciation and amortization, $12.5 million of share-based compensation expense, a $10.4 million asset impairment, and a $5.9 million adjustment to our environmental reserve liability, partially offset by $8.3 million of deferred income tax benefit. Net changes in working capital of $49.3 million were primarily driven by pension contributions exceeding pension expense.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations, excluding customer trust fund activity, was $40.2 million, including $32.2 million in capital expenditures for software and technology and $8.0 million in capital expenditures for property and equipment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations excluding customer trust fund activity was $51.1 million, primarily related to capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from divestitures. Our capital expenditures included $33.1 million for software and technology and $17.5 million for property and equipment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations excluding customer trust fund activity was $68.7 million, primarily related to the net proceeds from divestitures of $101.6 million, offset by capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures included $25.5 million for software and technology and $7.4 million for property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations, excluding the change in customer trust fund obligations, was $163.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. This cash inflow is primarily attributable to the net proceeds received from our IPO and concurrent private placement of $595.0 million, a net increase in the principal of our term loan of $23.0 million, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options of $45.8 million, partially offset by a $475.0 million payment to redeem our Senior Notes and debt refinancing costs of $23.3 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations excluding the change in customer trust fund obligations was $50.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily related to the funding of the remaining $75.2 million from the issuance of Senior Preferred Stock, partially offset by a $25.9 million payment made on our term debt.\nNet cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations excluding the change in customer trust fund obligation was $63.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, related to proceeds received from the issuance of Senior Preferred Stock, partially offset by payments made on our term debt.\nCash Flows from Discontinued Operations\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in discontinued operations was $1.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in discontinued operations was $10.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in discontinued operations was $1.9 million. The cash flows from discontinued operations for all periods primarily relate to changes in working capital.\nBacklog\nWe do not believe that any measure of backlog is a meaningful indicator of revenues that can be expected for a particular future period as the amount and timing can be influenced by multiple factors, including the timing of the completion of implementation, the accuracy and success of implementation services provided by us and by third parties, the timing in which new customers go-live, and our ability to meet service level commitments.\nSeasonality\nWe have in the past and expect in the future to experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and new customer contracts with the fourth quarter historically being our strongest quarter for new customer contracts, renewals, and customer go-lives. Although the growth of our Cloud solutions and the ratable nature of our fees makes this seasonality less apparent in our overall results of operations, we expect our revenue to fluctuate quarterly and to be higher in the fourth and first quarters of each year. Fourth quarter revenue is driven by year-end processing fees and Dayforce customer go-lives; and first quarter revenue is driven by revenue earned for printing of year-end tax packages.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements\u201d (as such term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K).\nOur Indebtedness\nOn April 30, 2018, Ceridian entered into a credit agreement pursuant to which the lenders agreed to provide Senior Credit Facilities, consisting of the Senior Term Loan in the original principal amount of $680.0 million and a $300.0 million Revolving Facility. The Revolving Facility may, at our option, be made available in United States Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Euros and/or Pounds Sterling; up to $70.0 million may, at our option, be made available for letters of credit and $100.0 million may, at our option, be made available for swingline loans (denominated in Canadian Dollars and/or United States Dollars).\nThe Senior Term Loan will mature on April 30, 2025. We are required to make annual amortization payments in respect of the Senior Term Loan in an amount equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount thereof, payable in equal quarterly installments of 0.25% of the original principal amount of the first lien term loan. The Revolving Facility matures on April 30, 2023 and does not require amortization payments.\nThe obligations of Ceridian under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured by first priority security interests in substantially all of the assets of Ceridian and the guarantors, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions. All of our subsidiaries are guarantors under the Senior Credit Facilities, subject to certain exceptions. The Senior Credit Facilities contain financial covenants and certain business covenants, including restrictions on dividend payments, which Ceridian must comply with during the term of the agreement. As of December 31, 2018, Ceridian was in full compliance with the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities.\nBorrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate per annum equal to:\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.\n</td> <td> in the case of borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars on any day (a) at Ceridian's election, either (i) an amount (not less than 1.00%) equal to the greater of (A) a base rate determined by reference to the rate of interest per annum announced by Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch ( DBNY\u201d) as its prime rate on such day, (B) the federal funds effective rate on such date plus 1/2 of 1.00% and (C) the London interbank offered rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus 1.00% or (ii) if available, LIBOR for U.S. dollars determined by reference to the applicable Reuters screen page two business days prior to the commencement of the interest period relevant to the subject borrowing, adjusted for certain additional costs, which may not be less than 0.00% plus (b) an applicable margin;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.\n</td> <td> in the case of borrowings under the Revolving Facility denominated in Canadian Dollars on any day (a) at Ceridian's election, either (i) the rate of interest per annum quoted or established as the prime rate\u201d of Deutsche Bank AG Canada Branch plus an applicable margin or (ii) CDOR for Canadian dollars determined by reference to the applicable Reuters screen page on date of the commencement of the interest period relevant to the subject borrowing, adjusted for certain additional costs, which may not be less than 0.00% plus (b) an applicable margin;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.\n</td> <td> in the case of borrowings under the Revolving Facility denominated in Euros on any day, (a) The London interbank offered rate in Euros ( EURIBOR\u201d) determined by reference to the applicable Reuters screen page two business days prior to the commencement of the interest period relevant to the subject borrowing, which may not be less than 0.00% plus (b) an applicable margin; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.\n</td> <td> in the case of borrowings under the Revolving Facility denominated in Pounds Sterling, (a) Sterling LIBOR determined by reference to the applicable Reuters screen page one business day prior to the commencement of the interest period relevant to the subject borrowing, which may not be less than 0.00% plus (b) an applicable margin.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe applicable margin for the Senior Term Loan is (i) 3.25% per annum, in the case of LIBOR loans and (ii) 2.25% per annum, in the case of base rate loans.

We conduct substantially all of our operations in leased facilities. Most of these leases contain renewal options and require payments for taxes, insurance, and maintenance. We also lease equipment for use in our business.\nPayments of retirement plan obligations include employer commitments to fund our defined benefit and postretirement plans and do not include estimated future benefit payments to participants expected to be made from liquidation of the assets in our defined benefit plan trusts. At December 31, 2018, our defined benefit pension plans had a projected benefit obligation that exceeded the fair value of the plans' assets by $145.8 million and our postretirement benefit plan had an accumulated benefit obligation that exceeded the fair value of the plans' assets by $16.8 million. We expect to satisfy these remaining obligations through investment income from and appreciation in the fair value of plan assets held in trust and from future employer contributions.\nThe amount of our obligation to vendors for capital expenditures at December 31, 2018 was not material, and no such amount is included in the table above.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related notes requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers, and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on-going basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.\nPlease refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d for a description of our significant accounting policies. The accounting policies that we believe to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and that require the most complex and subjective management judgments are discussed below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from the sale of our services, net of applicable sales taxes, when the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. We rely on a signed contract with the customer as the persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement.\nWe enter into revenue arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables based on the needs of our customers. For example, our services address a broad range of employment process needs, such as payroll, payroll-related tax filing, human resource information, employee self-service capabilities, time and labor management, and recruitment and applicant screening. A customer arrangement may contain any of these elements with different elements delivered across multiple reporting periods.\nWe have a single unit of accounting for each deliverable in a contract based on the use of estimated selling price ( ESP\u201d) in those cases where vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price ( VSOE\u201d) or third party evidence ( TPE\u201d) cannot be established. Our determination of ESP involves the consideration of several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of each contract. Specifically, we consider the cost to produce or to provide the deliverable, the anticipated margin on that deliverable, the selling price and profit margin for similar services, the value of any enhancements that have been built into the deliverable, and the characteristics of the varying markets in which the deliverable will be sold.\nWhen we are unable to establish a selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use ESP in the allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a standalone basis.\nWe regularly review VSOE, TPE, and ESP and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates. There were no material impacts during the period, nor do we currently expect a material impact in the near term from changes in VSOE, TPE, or ESP.\nDeferred revenue consists primarily of customer billings in advance of revenues being recognized from our contracts. Deferred revenue also includes certain deferred professional services fees that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting with subscription fees and are recognized as revenues over the same period as the related customer contract. Deferred revenue that is anticipated to be recognized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue, and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d for a full discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP financial measures, are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a component of our management incentive plan and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as adjusted to exclude net income or loss from discontinued operations, sponsor management fees, non-cash charges for asset impairments, gains or losses on assets and liabilities held in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of a company subsidiary, share-based compensation expense, severance charges, restructuring consulting fees, transaction costs, and environmental reserve charges. Adjusted EBITDA margin is determined by calculating the percentage Adjusted EBITDA is of total revenue. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin exclude the results of decisions that are outside the control of operating management.\nOur presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are intended as supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit (loss), net income (loss), earnings per share, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as measures of operating cash flows or liquidity. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by similar items to those eliminated in this presentation. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are included in this discussion because they are key metrics used by management to assess our operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not defined under GAAP, are not measures of net income, operating income, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, and are subject to important limitations. Our use of the terms Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry and are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any charges for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may need to be replaced in the future;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect the impact of share-based compensation upon our results of operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;

"item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as of, and for, the periods presented. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding industry outlook, our expectations for the future of our business, and our liquidity and capital resources as well as other non-historical statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties described in Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nCeridian is a global HCM software company. We categorize our solutions into two categories: Cloud and Bureau solutions. Cloud revenue is generated from HCM solutions that are delivered via two cloud offerings: Dayforce, our flagship cloud HCM platform, and Powerpay, a cloud HR and payroll solution for the Canadian small business market. We also continue to support customers using our Bureau solutions, which we generally stopped actively selling to new customers following the acquisition of Dayforce in 2012. We invest in maintenance and necessary updates to support our Bureau customers and continue to migrate them to Dayforce.\nDayforce provides HR, payroll, benefits, workforce management, and talent management functionality. Our platform is used by organizations, regardless of industry or size, to optimize management of the entire employee lifecycle, including attracting, engaging, paying, deploying, and developing their people. Dayforce was built as a single application from the ground up that combines a modern, consumer-grade user experience with proprietary application architecture, including a single employee record and a rules engine spanning all areas of HCM. Dayforce provides continuous real-time calculations across all modules to enable, for example, payroll administrators access to data through the entire pay period, and managers access to real-time data to optimize work schedules. Our platform is designed to make work life better for our customers and their employees by improving HCM decision-making processes, streamlining workflows, exposing strategic organizational insights, and simplifying legislative compliance. The platform is designed to ease administrative work for both employees and managers, creating opportunities for companies to increase employee engagement. We are a founder-led organization, and our culture combines the agility and innovation of a start-up with a history of deep domain and operational expertise.\nWe sell Dayforce through our direct sales force on a subscription per-employee, per-month ( PEPM\u201d) basis. Our subscriptions are typically structured with an initial fixed term of between three and five years, with evergreen renewal thereafter. Dayforce can serve customers of all sizes, ranging from 100 to over 100,000 employees. We have rapidly grown the Dayforce platform to more than 3,700 live Dayforce customers, representing approximately 3.1 million active global users as of December 31, 2018. In 2018, we added over 715 net new live Dayforce customers. Our customers vary across industries, and no single customer constituted more than 1% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. We have experienced significant Cloud revenue growth at scale, particularly from Dayforce, which has grown at a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR\u201d) of more than 55% since 2012. Our annual Cloud revenue retention rate continues to exceed 95% due to our intense focus on solving complex problems and our superior customer experience.\nThe following table presents Dayforce revenue by quarter from 2012 to 2018.\nOur Business Model\nOur business model focuses on supporting the rapid growth of Dayforce and maximizing the lifetime value of our Dayforce customer relationships. Due to our subscription model, where we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period, and high customer retention rates, we have a high level of visibility into our future revenues. The profitability of a customer to our business depends, in large part, on how long they have been a customer. Because in our current business model, PEPM subscription fees are not charged until the customer goes live, and because we incur costs in advance of receiving PEPM revenue that are not offset by our implementation fees, we estimate that it takes an average of 2.5 years before we are able to recover our implementation, customer acquisition, and other direct costs on a new Dayforce customer contract. As the proportion of Dayforce customers who have been live for two or more years increases, our related profitability increases. The following sets forth the number of live Dayforce customers at the end of each quarter presented:\n\nOver the lifetime of the customer relationship, we have the opportunity to realize additional PEPM revenue, both as the customer grows or rolls out the Dayforce solution to additional employees, and also by selling additional functionality to existing customers that do not currently utilize our full platform. We also incur costs to manage the account, to retain customers, and to sell additional functionality. These costs, however, are significantly less than the costs initially incurred to acquire and to implement the customer.\nHow We Assess Our Performance\nIn assessing our performance, we consider a variety of performance indicators in addition to revenue and net income. Set forth below is a description of our key performance measures.\n\n (a) Annual Cloud revenue retention rate and Cloud annualized recurring revenue are calculated on an annual basis, and the disclosure reflects data as of the most recent fiscal year end. Please see below for further explanation. \n (b) For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating profit, please see Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d \nLive Dayforce Customers\nWe use the number of customers live on Dayforce as an indicator of future revenue and the overall performance of the business and to assess the performance of our implementation services. As shown in the following table, the number of customers live on Dayforce has increased from 482 as of December 31, 2012 to 3,718 as of December 31, 2018. In addition, we had over 450 net new Dayforce customers contracted, but not yet live on Dayforce as of December 31, 2018. We expect the majority of these Dayforce customers to be taken live in 2019. For 2018, our 3,718 live Dayforce customers represented over 3.1 million active users. We market Dayforce to customers of all sizes, including small (under 500 employees), mid-sized (501 to 2,500 employees), and enterprise (over 2,500 employees). For 2018, small businesses accounted for 14% of the total number of active customer employees, mid-sized businesses accounted for 32% of the total number of active customer employees, and enterprise businesses accounted for 54% of the total number of active customer employees. As our business and go-to-market strategy continues to evolve, in 2019, we will be modifying our customer segmentation for increased relevance.\nFrom 2017 to 2018, live Dayforce customers increased from 3,001 to 3,718, a net increase of 717. Of the customers taken live during 2018, 77% represented net new customers to Dayforce, and the remainder were migration customers from our Bureau solution. Of the net new customers to Dayforce, small businesses accounted for 9% of the total number of active customer employees, mid-sized businesses accounted for 33% of the total number of active customer employees, and enterprise businesses accounted for 58% of the total number of active customer employees. Of the migration customers, small businesses accounted for 23% of the total number of active customer employees, mid-sized businesses accounted for 41% of the total number of active customer employees, and enterprise businesses accounted for 36% of the total number of active customer employees.\nFrom 2016 to 2017, live Dayforce customers increased from 2,339 to 3,001, a net increase of 662. Of the customers taken live during 2017, 58% represented net new customers to Dayforce and the remainder were migration customers from our Bureau solutions. Of the net new customers to Dayforce, small businesses accounted for 13% of the total number of active customer employees, mid-sized businesses accounted for 33% of the total number of active customer employees, and enterprise businesses accounted for 54% of the total number of active customer employees. Of the migration customers, small businesses accounted for 20% of the total number of active customer employees, mid-sized businesses accounted for 48% of the total number of active customer employees, and enterprise businesses accounted for 32% of the total number of active customer employees.\nThe following table sets forth the number of live Dayforce customers at the end of the years presented:\nAnnual Cloud Revenue Retention Rate\nOur annual Cloud revenue retention rate measures the percentage of revenues that we retain from our existing Cloud customers. We use this retention rate as an indicator of customer satisfaction and future revenues. We calculate the annual Cloud revenue retention rate as a percentage, where the numerator is the Cloud annualized recurring revenue for the prior year, less the Cloud annualized recurring revenue from lost Cloud customers during that year; and the denominator is the Cloud annualized recurring revenue for the prior year. Our annual Cloud revenue retention rate has been 95% or above for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. We set annual targets for Cloud revenue retention rate and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis by reviewing known and anticipated customer losses. Our Cloud revenue retention rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the mix of Cloud solutions used by customers, the level of customer satisfaction, and changes in the number of users live on our Cloud solutions.\nCloud Annualized Recurring Revenue ( ARR\u201d)\nWe derive the majority of our Cloud revenues from recurring fees, primarily PEPM subscription charges. We also derive recurring revenue from fees related to the rental and maintenance of clocks, charges for once-a-year services, such as year-end tax statements, and investment income on our customer funds held in trust before such funds are remitted to taxing authorities, customer employees, or other third parties. To calculate Cloud ARR, we start with recurring revenue at year end, subtract the once-a-year charges, annualize the revenue for customers live for less than a full year to reflect the revenue that would have been realized if the customer had been live for a full year, and add back the once-a-year charges. We set annual targets for Cloud ARR and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP financial measures, are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are components of our management incentive plan and are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as adjusted to exclude net income or loss from discontinued operations, sponsor management fees, non-cash charges for asset impairments, gains or losses on assets and liabilities held in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of a company subsidiary, share-based compensation expense, severance charges, restructuring consulting fees, transaction costs, and environmental reserve charges. Adjusted EBITDA margin is determined by calculating the percentage Adjusted EBITDA is of Total Revenue. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin exclude the results of decisions that are outside the normal course of our business operations. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating profit, please see Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d\nOur History\nCeridian was acquired in 2007 by affiliates and co-investors of the Sponsors. In April 2012, Ceridian acquired Dayforce Corporation, which had built Dayforce, a cloud HCM solution. In the months following the acquisition, Dayforce founder, David D. Ossip, was named Chief Executive Officer of Ceridian HCM, and shortly thereafter, we generally stopped actively selling our Bureau solutions to new customers in the United States to focus our resources on expanding the Dayforce platform and growing Cloud solutions. For each quarter since September 30, 2016, our Cloud revenue has surpassed our Bureau revenue. Cloud revenue grew from 39% of total revenue during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 to 74% of total revenue during the quarter ended December 31, 2018.\nAs part of our strategy to focus on the growth of our Cloud solutions business, we undertook the following initiatives to simplify our business model:\n (i) sold our consumer-directed benefit services business in 2013, \n (ii) merged Comdata, our payment systems business unit, with FleetCor Technologies in 2014, \n (iii) sold our benefits administration and post-employment compliance business in 2015, \n (iv) sold our United Kingdom and Ireland Bureau businesses and a portion of our operations that supported such businesses in Mauritius in 2016, and \n (v) contributed our LifeWorks employee assistance program business to a joint venture, LifeWorks, in 2016, then distributed our ownership in this joint venture to a holding company owned by our stockholders in April 2018 (the LifeWorks Disposition\u201d). \nAs a result of these transactions, we only actively sell Dayforce and Powerpay, which we believe simplifies our business model and positions us well for continued growth.\nOur benefits administration and post-employee compliance business, our United Kingdom and Ireland businesses, our divested Mauritius operations, and our LifeWorks joint venture are presented as discontinued operations in our financial statements. Our consumer-directed benefits services business and our benefits administration and post-employment compliance business are collectively referred to as our Divested Benefits Businesses.\u201d After the LifeWorks Disposition, management has concluded that we have one operating and reportable segment. This conclusion aligns with how management monitors operating performance, allocates resources, and deploys capital. Please refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these transactions.\nOn April 30, 2018, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold 21,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. We granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase an additional 3,150,000 shares of common stock at the offering price, which was exercised in full. A total of 24,150,000 shares of common stock were issued on April 30, 2018, with gross proceeds of $531.3 million from the IPO before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses. Immediately subsequent to the closing of our IPO on April 30, 2018, THL / Cannae Investors LLC, one of our existing stockholders controlled by our Sponsors, purchased from us in a private placement $100.0 million of our common stock at a price per share equal to the offering price. Based on the offering price of $22.00 per share, 4,545,455 shares were issued in this private placement. Please refer to Note 1, Organization,\u201d for further discussion of the IPO transaction.\nWe applied a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to satisfy and to discharge the indenture governing our outstanding $475.0 million principal amount Senior Notes, and they were redeemed on May 30, 2018. Concurrently, we also refinanced our remaining debt under our (i) $702.0 million (original principal amount) Senior Term Debt and (ii) $130.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, including accrued interest and related costs and expenses, with new senior credit facilities consisting of a $680.0 million term loan debt facility and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility. Please refer to Note 9, Debt,\u201d for further discussion of the debt transactions.\nThe IPO, private placement, and debt refinancing had the following impacts to our results of operations and cash during 2018:\n\nOn November 16, 2018, we completed a secondary offering, in which certain of our stockholders (the Selling Stockholders\u201d) sold 11,000,000 shares of common stock, in an underwritten public offering at $36.00 per share. The Selling Stockholders granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase an additional 1,650,000 shares of common stock at the offering price, which was exercised in full. A total of 12,650,000 shares of common stock were sold by the Selling Stockholders on November 16, 2018, with all proceeds going to the Selling Stockholders. We incurred expenses of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, related to the secondary offering within selling, general, and administrative expense.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe generate recurring revenues primarily from recurring fees charged for the use of our Cloud solutions, Dayforce and Powerpay, as well as from our Bureau solutions. We also generate professional services and other revenue associated primarily with the work performed to assist customers with the planning, design, implementation, and staging of their cloud-based solution. Our solutions are typically provided through long-term customer relationships that result in a high level of recurring revenue. We also generate recurring services revenue from investment income on our Cloud and Bureau customer funds held in trust before such funds are remitted to taxing authorities, customer employees, or other third parties. We refer to this investment income as float revenue.\nFor Dayforce, we primarily charge monthly recurring fees on a PEPM basis, generally one-month in advance of service, based on the number and type of solutions provided to the customer and the number of employees and other users at the customer. Our standard Dayforce contracts are generally for a three to five-year period. The average time it takes to implement Dayforce typically ranges from three months for smaller customers to nine months for larger customers. Once Dayforce is implemented, the customer goes live, and we begin to generate recurring revenue. We also provide outsourced human resource solutions to certain of our Dayforce customers, which are tailored to meet their individual needs, and entail performing the duties of a customer's human resources department, including payroll processing, time and labor management, performance management, and recruiting, as needed.\nThe Powerpay offering is our solution designed primarily for small market Canadian customers. The typical Powerpay customer has fewer than 20 employees, and the majority of the revenue is generated from recurring fees charged on a per-employee, per-process basis. Typical processes include the customer's payroll runs, year-end tax packages, and delivery of customers' remittance advices or checks. Powerpay can typically be implemented on a remote basis within one to three days, at which point we start receiving recurring fees.\nFor our Bureau solutions, we typically charge recurring fees on a per-process basis. Typical processes include the customer's payroll runs, year-end tax packages, and delivery of customers' remittance advices or checks. In addition to customers who use our payroll services, certain customers use our tax filing services on a stand-alone basis. Our outsourced human resource solutions are tailored to meet the needs of individual customers, and entail our contracting to perform many of the duties of a customer's human resources department, including payroll processing, time and labor management, performance management, and recruiting. We also perform individual services for customers, such as check printing, wage attachment and disbursement, and ACA management.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of costs to deliver our solutions. Most of these costs are recognized as incurred. Some costs of revenue are recognized in the period that a service is sold and delivered. Other costs of revenue are recognized over the period of use or in proportion to the related revenue.\nThe costs recognized as incurred consist primarily of customer service staff costs, customer technical support costs, implementation personnel costs, costs of hosting applications, consulting and purchased services, delivery services, and royalties. The costs of revenue recognized over the period of use are depreciation and amortization, rentals of facilities and equipment, and direct and incremental costs associated with deferred implementation service revenue.\nCost of recurring services revenues primarily consists of costs to provide maintenance and technical support to our customers and the costs of hosting our applications. The cost of recurring services revenues also includes compensation and other employee-related expenses for data center staff, payments to outside service providers, data center expenses, and networking expenses.\nCost of professional services and other revenues primarily consists of costs to provide implementation consulting services and training to our customers, as well as the cost of time clocks. Costs to provide implementation consulting services include compensation and other employee-related expenses for professional services staff, costs of subcontractors, and travel. Implementation consulting services are expected to continue to be primarily associated with the implementation of our Cloud solutions.\nProduct development and management expense, included in cost of revenue, consists of costs related to software development activities that do not qualify for capitalization, such as development, quality assurance, testing of new technologies, and enhancements to our existing solutions that do not result in additional functionality. Product development and management expense also includes costs related to the management of our solutions.\nDepreciation and amortization related to cost of revenue primarily consists of amortization of capitalized software.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expense\nSelling expense includes costs related to maintaining a direct marketing infrastructure and sales force and other direct marketing efforts, such as marketing events, advertising, telemarketing, direct mail, and trade shows. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Our sales and marketing expenses are expected to continue to be primarily associated with selling and marketing our Cloud solutions.\nGeneral and administrative expense includes costs that are not directly related to delivery of services, selling efforts, or product development and management, primarily consisting of corporate-level costs, such as administration, finance, legal, and human resources, as well as management fees payable to affiliates of our Sponsors, FNF and THLM, until termination of the management agreements upon IPO in April 2018. Also included in this category are depreciation, and amortization of other intangible assets not reflected in cost of revenue, the provision for doubtful accounts receivable, and net periodic pension costs.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net includes the results of transactions that are not appropriately classified in another category. These items include certain foreign currency translation gains and losses resulting mainly from intercompany receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary's functional currency, environmental reserve charges, and charges related to the impairment of asset values.\nIncome Tax Provision\nOur income tax provision represents federal, state, and international taxes on our income recognized for financial statement purposes and includes the effects of temporary differences between financial statement income and income recognized for tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as adjusted for the expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to reflect the net deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized. In assessing the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of pre-tax book income, expiration of net operating losses, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, as well as current tax laws. As of December 31, 2018, we continue to record a full valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets that are not offset by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities. In the future, if it is determined that we no longer have a requirement to record a valuation allowance against all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, the release of the valuation allowance would have a positive impact on our income tax provision.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act legislation (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted. The Tax Act amended the Code to reduce tax rates and to modify policies, credits, and deductions for businesses. For businesses, the Tax Act reduced the corporate federal tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented.\n\n (a) For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating profit, please see Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d \nRevenue. The following table sets forth certain information regarding our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\n (a) We present revenue growth in a constant currency to assess how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We calculate percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis by applying a fixed $1.30 Canadian dollar to $1.00 U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate to revenues originally booked in Canadian dollars for all applicable periods. \nTotal revenue increased $75.6 million, or 11.3%, to $746.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $670.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in Cloud revenue of $130.0 million, or 32.2% from $404.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $534.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Cloud revenue increase was primarily due to an increase of $106.9 million, or 31.8%, in Cloud recurring services revenue, and $23.1 million, or 33.9%, in Cloud professional services and other revenue. The increase in Cloud recurring services revenue of $106.9 million was attributable to increases of $76.0 million from new customers, add-ons, and revenue uplift from migrations of Bureau customers; $22.9 million from the migration of Bureau customers; and $20.0 million from increased float revenue related to Cloud recurring services revenue, partially offset by customer attrition of $12.0 million. The increase in Cloud revenue was partially offset by a decline in Bureau revenue of $54.4 million, or 20.4%. There was an immaterial impact on revenue due to changes in foreign currency rate fluctuations. Please refer to the table above for our revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis.\nOf the decline in Bureau revenue, approximately 58% was driven by customer attrition and approximately 42% was attributable to customer migrations to Dayforce. Excluding the impact of migrations, our annual Bureau revenue retention rate was 86.9% in 2018 and 89.7% in 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, recurring services revenue from payroll Bureau customers accounted for $161.2 million, and tax-only Bureau recurring services revenue accounted for $48.2 million. The payroll Bureau customers consist of approximately 1.5 million active users, of which approximately 1.4 million are customers that we believe could be candidates for migration to Dayforce. Some of our customers are not candidates to migrate to Dayforce due to a variety of factors, including the type of functionality that they require and their system configuration. Of the approximately 1.4 million active users that we believe could be candidates for migration to Dayforce, small businesses accounted for 21% of the total number of active users, mid-sized businesses accounted for 28% of the total number of active users, and enterprise businesses accounted for 51% of the total number of active users.\nCloud revenue by solution. The following table presents our Cloud revenue for both recurring and professional services and other, for both our Dayforce and Powerpay solution for the periods presented.\n\nCloud revenue was $534.3 million for 2018, an increase of 32.2% when compared to 2017. Dayforce revenue grew 38.5%, and Powerpay revenue grew 8.2% in 2018 as compared to 2017. There was an immaterial impact on revenue due to changes in foreign currency rate fluctuations. Please refer to the table above for our revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis. Our new business sales to Dayforce and Powerpay customers comprised 82% of our increase in Cloud revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the remaining 18% consisted primarily of customer migration to Dayforce from our Bureau solutions. As we migrate our Bureau customers to Dayforce, we typically experience a revenue increase from such customers driven by increased product density on the Dayforce platform. This revenue increase can vary by customer, but has been 22% on average since 2016, as measured at the time of initial migration.\nFloat revenue. Investment income from invested customer trust funds included in revenue was $67.0 million and $46.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The average float balance for our customer trust funds for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3,361.5 million, compared to $3,228.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The average yield was 2.00% during the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 55 basis points compared to the average yield for the year ended December 31, 2017. Based on current investment practices, an increase in market investment rates of 100 basis points would increase float revenue by approximately $17 million over the twelve months following a rate increase. In addition to interest rate risks, we also have exposure to risks associated with changes in laws and regulations that may affect customer fund balances. For example, a change in regulations, either reducing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities, would reduce our average customer trust fund balances and float revenue. There are no incremental costs of revenue associated with increases or declines in float revenue.\nCost of revenue. Total cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $425.8 million, an increase of $18.3 million, or 4.5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Of the total $18.3 million increase, $2.1 million was attributable to IPO-related share-based compensation expense. Excluding IPO-related items, cost of revenue increased $16.2 million.\nRecurring services cost of revenue increased by $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due to additional costs incurred to support the growing Dayforce customer base, partially offset by reductions in costs to support our Bureau customers.\nThe reduction in cost of revenue for professional services and other of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to productivity improvements in implementing new customers.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 350, we are required to capitalize certain software development costs. Please refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d for further discussion of our accounting policy for internally developed software costs. Costs related to software development activities that do not qualify for capitalization, such as development, quality assurance, testing of new technologies, enhancements to our existing solutions that do not result in additional functionality, and costs related to the management of our solutions are presented as product development and management expense. The increase in product development and management expense of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, reflects increases in Dayforce product development efforts. For the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, our investment in software development was $54.9 million and $45.0 million, respectively, consisting of $29.6 million and $19.0 million of research and development expense, which is included within product development and management expense, and $25.3 million and $26.0 million of capitalized software development, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization expense associated with cost of revenue increased by $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, as we continue to capitalize Dayforce related and other development costs and subsequently amortize those costs.\nThe table below presents total gross margin and solution gross margins for the periods presented:\n\nTotal gross margin is defined as total gross profit as a percentage of total revenue, inclusive of product development and management costs as well as depreciation and amortization associated with cost of revenue. Gross margin for each solution in the table above is defined as total revenue less cost of revenue for the applicable solution as a percentage of total revenue for that related solution, exclusive of any product development and management or depreciation and amortization cost allocations.\nThe overall 11.3% increase in revenue outpaced the 4.5% increase in cost of revenue, and gross profit increased by $57.3 million, or 21.8%, as we continued to leverage our investment in people and processes to realize economies of scale.\nCloud recurring services gross margin was 68.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 62.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in Cloud recurring services gross margin reflects an increase in the proportion of Dayforce customers live for more than two years, which increased from 59% as of December 31, 2017 to 63% as of December 31, 2018, and was also attributable to consistent configuration of new customers, which enabled us to realize economies of scale in customer support and hosting costs. Professional services and other gross margin was (40.8)% for the year ended December 31, 2018, improving from (87.8)% for the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting an increase in profitable post go-live professional services and productivity improvements in implementing new customers.\nSelling, general, and administrative expense. Selling, general, and administrative expense increased $47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Of the total $47.7 million increase, $24.5 million was attributable to transaction expenses associated with our IPO, debt refinancing, and secondary offering, including $11.3 million in sponsor management termination fees, $6.0 million in IPO-related share-based compensation expense, $3.7 million in other IPO transactions costs, and $3.5 million in restructuring consulting expenses. Excluding transaction-related items, selling, general, and administrative expense increased $23.2 million, primarily due to sales and marketing expense, which increased by $13.4 million. We continue to invest in our sales and marketing efforts, as we drive growth in our Cloud solutions, particularly in Dayforce. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses also reflected increases in employee related costs and increased costs associated with being a public company.\nOther (income) expense, net. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $2.9 million of other income, net, compared to $7.3 million of other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The other (income) expense, net, for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, was primarily related to remeasurement gains and losses an intercompany payable denominated in a foreign currency, which was repaid in the second quarter of 2018.\nOperating profit. We realized operating profit of $52.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to an operating profit of $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Excluding the impact of $24.5 million in transaction costs within selling, general, and administrative expense, and $2.1 million in other increased share-based compensation expense related to the IPO within cost of revenue, operating profit would have been $79.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This $46.4 million increase was primarily due to a $75.6 million increase in revenue and gross margin improvement.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $83.2 million, compared to $87.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This reduction was primarily due to the refinancing of our debt, which resulted in a reduction in interest expense of $30.6 million upon the extinguishment of the Senior Notes in April 2018, representing seven fewer months of interest on the Senior Notes as compared to the prior year, partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt of $25.7 million. As of December 31, 2018, a 100 point basis increase in the London Inter-bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) rates would result in an approximately $7 million increase in our interest expense over the ensuring twelve-month period. Please refer to Note 9, Debt,\u201d for additional information.\nIncome tax expense. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had income tax expense of $7.7 million, compared to income tax benefit of $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $57.3 million increase in tax expense is primarily attributable to the $59.4 million tax benefit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities upon the initial implementation of the Tax Act.\nLoss from discontinued operations. As a result of the LifeWorks Disposition, the financial results of the LifeWorks business have been included within discontinued operations for all periods presented. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had a loss from discontinued operations of $25.8 million, compared to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, is primarily related to income tax expense incurred as a result of the LifeWorks Disposition.\nNet loss attributable to Ceridian. Net loss attributable to Ceridian was $63.4 for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to $52.3 million of expenses incurred related to our IPO, debt refinancing, and secondary offering transactions, partially offset by an increase in gross profit. Net loss attributable to Ceridian was $9.2 for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a tax benefit of approximately $59.4 million related to the 2017 tax reform legislation. Please refer to the Our History\u201d section above for additional information on the financial statement impacts of our IPO, debt refinancing, and secondary offering transactions.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, and Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 21.0% in 2018 from 17.6% in 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented.\n\n (a) For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating profit, please see Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d \nRevenue. The following table sets forth certain information regarding our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with the year ended December 31, 2016.\n Year Ended December 31, Growth", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as of, and for, the periods presented. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding industry outlook, our expectations for the future of our business, and our liquidity and capital resources as well as other non-historical statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties described in Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nCeridian is a global HCM software company. We categorize our solutions into two categories: Cloud and Bureau solutions. Cloud revenue is generated from HCM solutions that are delivered via two cloud offerings: Dayforce, our flagship cloud HCM platform, and Powerpay, a cloud HR and payroll solution for the Canadian small business market. We also continue to support customers using our Bureau solutions, which we generally stopped actively selling to new customers following the acquisition of Dayforce in 2012. We invest in maintenance and necessary updates to support our Bureau customers and continue to migrate them to Dayforce.\nDayforce provides HR, payroll, benefits, workforce management, and talent management functionality. Our platform is used by organizations, regardless of industry or size, to optimize management of the entire employee lifecycle, including attracting, engaging, paying, deploying, and developing their people. Dayforce was built as a single application from the ground up that combines a modern, consumer-grade user experience with proprietary application architecture, including a single employee record and a rules engine spanning all areas of HCM. Dayforce provides continuous real-time calculations across all modules to enable, for example, payroll administrators access to data through the entire pay period, and managers access to real-time data to optimize work schedules. Our platform is designed to make work life better for our customers and their employees by improving HCM decision-making processes, streamlining workflows, exposing strategic organizational insights, and simplifying legislative compliance. The platform is designed to ease administrative work for both employees and managers, creating opportunities for companies to increase employee engagement. We are a founder-led organization, and our culture combines the agility and innovation of a start-up with a history of deep domain and operational expertise.\nWe sell Dayforce through our direct sales force on a subscription per-employee, per-month ( PEPM\u201d) basis. Our subscriptions are typically structured with an initial fixed term of between three and five years, with evergreen renewal thereafter. Dayforce can serve customers of all sizes, ranging from 100 to over 100,000 employees. We have rapidly grown the Dayforce platform to more than 3,700 live Dayforce customers, representing approximately 3.1 million active global users as of December 31, 2018. In 2018, we added over 715 net new live Dayforce customers. Our customers vary across industries, and no single customer constituted more than 1% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. We have experienced significant Cloud revenue growth at scale, particularly from Dayforce, which has grown at a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR\u201d) of more than 55% since 2012. Our annual Cloud revenue retention rate continues to exceed 95% due to our intense focus on solving complex problems and our superior customer experience.\nThe following table presents Dayforce revenue by quarter from 2012 to 2018.\nOur Business Model\nOur business model focuses on supporting the rapid growth of Dayforce and maximizing the lifetime value of our Dayforce customer relationships. Due to our subscription model, where we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period, and high customer retention rates, we have a high level of visibility into our future revenues. The profitability of a customer to our business depends, in large part, on how long they have been a customer. Because in our current business model, PEPM subscription fees are not charged until the customer goes live, and because we incur costs in advance of receiving PEPM revenue that are not offset by our implementation fees, we estimate that it takes an average of 2.5 years before we are able to recover our implementation, customer acquisition, and other direct costs on a new Dayforce customer contract. As the proportion of Dayforce customers who have been live for two or more years increases, our related profitability increases. The following sets forth the number of live Dayforce customers at the end of each quarter presented:\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December\n31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September\n30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June\n30,2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March\n31,2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December\n31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September\n30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June\n30,2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March\n31,2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December\n31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September\n30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June\n30,2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March\n31,2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Live Dayforce\ncustomers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dayforce\ncustomers live\nfor two or\nmore years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proportion\nof Dayforce\ncustomers live\nfor two or\nmore years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOver the lifetime of the customer relationship, we have the opportunity to realize additional PEPM revenue, both as the customer grows or rolls out the Dayforce solution to additional employees, and also by selling additional functionality to existing customers that do not currently utilize our full platform. We also incur costs to manage the account, to retain customers, and to sell additional functionality. These costs, however, are significantly less than the costs initially incurred to acquire and to implement the customer.\nHow We Assess Our Performance\nIn assessing our performance, we consider a variety of performance indicators in addition to revenue and net income. Set forth below is a description of our key performance measures.\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Live Dayforce customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Annual Cloud revenue retention rate (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cloud annualized recurring revenue (ARR) (a)\n(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 506.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 391.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 289.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA (b) (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 157.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Annual Cloud revenue retention rate and Cloud annualized recurring revenue are calculated on an annual basis, and the disclosure reflects data as of the most recent fiscal year end.

As shown in the following table, the number of customers live on Dayforce has increased from 482 as of December 31, 2012 to 3,718 as of December 31, 2018. In addition, we had over 450 net new Dayforce customers contracted, but not yet live on Dayforce as of December 31, 2018. We expect the majority of these Dayforce customers to be taken live in 2019. For 2018, our 3,718 live Dayforce customers represented over 3.1 million active users. We market Dayforce to customers of all sizes, including small (under 500 employees), mid-sized (501 to 2,500 employees), and enterprise (over 2,500 employees). For 2018, small businesses accounted for 14% of the total number of active customer employees, mid-sized businesses accounted for 32% of the total number of active customer employees, and enterprise businesses accounted for 54% of the total number of active customer employees. As our business and go-to-market strategy continues to evolve, in 2019, we will be modifying our customer segmentation for increased relevance.\nFrom 2017 to 2018, live Dayforce customers increased from 3,001 to 3,718, a net increase of 717. Of the customers taken live during 2018, 77% represented net new customers to Dayforce, and the remainder were migration customers from our Bureau solution. Of the net new customers to Dayforce, small businesses accounted for 9% of the total number of active customer employees, mid-sized businesses accounted for 33% of the total number of active customer employees, and enterprise businesses accounted for 58% of the total number of active customer employees. Of the migration customers, small businesses accounted for 23% of the total number of active customer employees, mid-sized businesses accounted for 41% of the total number of active customer employees, and enterprise businesses accounted for 36% of the total number of active customer employees.\nFrom 2016 to 2017, live Dayforce customers increased from 2,339 to 3,001, a net increase of 662. Of the customers taken live during 2017, 58% represented net new customers to Dayforce and the remainder were migration customers from our Bureau solutions. Of the net new customers to Dayforce, small businesses accounted for 13% of the total number of active customer employees, mid-sized businesses accounted for 33% of the total number of active customer employees, and enterprise businesses accounted for 54% of the total number of active customer employees. Of the migration customers, small businesses accounted for 20% of the total number of active customer employees, mid-sized businesses accounted for 48% of the total number of active customer employees, and enterprise businesses accounted for 32% of the total number of active customer employees.\nThe following table sets forth the number of live Dayforce customers at the end of the years presented:\nAnnual Cloud Revenue Retention Rate\nOur annual Cloud revenue retention rate measures the percentage of revenues that we retain from our existing Cloud customers. We use this retention rate as an indicator of customer satisfaction and future revenues. We calculate the annual Cloud revenue retention rate as a percentage, where the numerator is the Cloud annualized recurring revenue for the prior year, less the Cloud annualized recurring revenue from lost Cloud customers during that year; and the denominator is the Cloud annualized recurring revenue for the prior year. Our annual Cloud revenue retention rate has been 95% or above for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. We set annual targets for Cloud revenue retention rate and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis by reviewing known and anticipated customer losses. Our Cloud revenue retention rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the mix of Cloud solutions used by customers, the level of customer satisfaction, and changes in the number of users live on our Cloud solutions.\nCloud Annualized Recurring Revenue ( ARR\u201d)\nWe derive the majority of our Cloud revenues from recurring fees, primarily PEPM subscription charges. We also derive recurring revenue from fees related to the rental and maintenance of clocks, charges for once-a-year services, such as year-end tax statements, and investment income on our customer funds held in trust before such funds are remitted to taxing authorities, customer employees, or other third parties. To calculate Cloud ARR, we start with recurring revenue at year end, subtract the once-a-year charges, annualize the revenue for customers live for less than a full year to reflect the revenue that would have been realized if the customer had been live for a full year, and add back the once-a-year charges. We set annual targets for Cloud ARR and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP financial measures, are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are components of our management incentive plan and are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as adjusted to exclude net income or loss from discontinued operations, sponsor management fees, non-cash charges for asset impairments, gains or losses on assets and liabilities held in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of a company subsidiary, share-based compensation expense, severance charges, restructuring consulting fees, transaction costs, and environmental reserve charges. Adjusted EBITDA margin is determined by calculating the percentage Adjusted EBITDA is of Total Revenue. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin exclude the results of decisions that are outside the normal course of our business operations. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating profit, please see Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d\nOur History\nCeridian was acquired in 2007 by affiliates and co-investors of the Sponsors. In April 2012, Ceridian acquired Dayforce Corporation, which had built Dayforce, a cloud HCM solution. In the months following the acquisition, Dayforce founder, David D. Ossip, was named Chief Executive Officer of Ceridian HCM, and shortly thereafter, we generally stopped actively selling our Bureau solutions to new customers in the United States to focus our resources on expanding the Dayforce platform and growing Cloud solutions. For each quarter since September 30, 2016, our Cloud revenue has surpassed our Bureau revenue. Cloud revenue grew from 39% of total revenue during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 to 74% of total revenue during the quarter ended December 31, 2018.\nAs part of our strategy to focus on the growth of our Cloud solutions business, we undertook the following initiatives to simplify our business model:\n (i) sold our consumer-directed benefit services business in 2013, \n (ii) merged Comdata, our payment systems business unit, with FleetCor Technologies in 2014, \n (iii) sold our benefits administration and post-employment compliance business in 2015, \n (iv) sold our United Kingdom and Ireland Bureau businesses and a portion of our operations that supported such businesses in Mauritius in 2016, and \n (v) contributed our LifeWorks employee assistance program business to a joint venture, LifeWorks, in 2016, then distributed our ownership in this joint venture to a holding company owned by our stockholders in April 2018 (the LifeWorks Disposition\u201d). \nAs a result of these transactions, we only actively sell Dayforce and Powerpay, which we believe simplifies our business model and positions us well for continued growth.\nOur benefits administration and post-employee compliance business, our United Kingdom and Ireland businesses, our divested Mauritius operations, and our LifeWorks joint venture are presented as discontinued operations in our financial statements. Our consumer-directed benefits services business and our benefits administration and post-employment compliance business are collectively referred to as our Divested Benefits Businesses.\u201d After the LifeWorks Disposition, management has concluded that we have one operating and reportable segment. This conclusion aligns with how management monitors operating performance, allocates resources, and deploys capital. Please refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these transactions.\nOn April 30, 2018, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold 21,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. We granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase an additional 3,150,000 shares of common stock at the offering price, which was exercised in full. A total of 24,150,000 shares of common stock were issued on April 30, 2018, with gross proceeds of $531.3 million from the IPO before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses. Immediately subsequent to the closing of our IPO on April 30, 2018, THL / Cannae Investors LLC, one of our existing stockholders controlled by our Sponsors, purchased from us in a private placement $100.0 million of our common stock at a price per share equal to the offering price. Based on the offering price of $22.00 per share, 4,545,455 shares were issued in this private placement. Please refer to Note 1, Organization,\u201d for further discussion of the IPO transaction.\nWe applied a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to satisfy and to discharge the indenture governing our outstanding $475.0 million principal amount Senior Notes, and they were redeemed on May 30, 2018. Concurrently, we also refinanced our remaining debt under our (i) $702.0 million (original principal amount) Senior Term Debt and (ii) $130.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, including accrued interest and related costs and expenses, with new senior credit facilities consisting of a $680.0 million term loan debt facility and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility. Please refer to Note 9, Debt,\u201d for further discussion of the debt transactions.\nThe IPO, private placement, and debt refinancing had the following impacts to our results of operations and cash during 2018:\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Impacts to\nStatement of\nOperations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Impact to Cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross proceeds from the IPO and private placement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 631.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs capitalized within stockholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (36.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Redemption of Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (475.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt refinancing fees, reflected as a reduction to long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> IPO and debt refinancing related expenses reflected\nwithin results of operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general, and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact on operating profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact on net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (51.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (51.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash IPO-related share-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash interest expense adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash to balance sheet from the IPO and private placement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from issuance of the new $680.0 million Senior Term Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 680.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repayment of the $702.0 million Senior Term Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (657.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash to balance sheet from the IPO, private placement, and\ndebt refinancing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 91.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn November 16, 2018, we completed a secondary offering, in which certain of our stockholders (the Selling Stockholders\u201d) sold 11,000,000 shares of common stock, in an underwritten public offering at $36.00 per share. The Selling Stockholders granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase an additional 1,650,000 shares of common stock at the offering price, which was exercised in full. A total of 12,650,000 shares of common stock were sold by the Selling Stockholders on November 16, 2018, with all proceeds going to the Selling Stockholders. We incurred expenses of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, related to the secondary offering within selling, general, and administrative expense.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe generate recurring revenues primarily from recurring fees charged for the use of our Cloud solutions, Dayforce and Powerpay, as well as from our Bureau solutions. We also generate professional services and other revenue associated primarily with the work performed to assist customers with the planning, design, implementation, and staging of their cloud-based solution. Our solutions are typically provided through long-term customer relationships that result in a high level of recurring revenue. We also generate recurring services revenue from investment income on our Cloud and Bureau customer funds held in trust before such funds are remitted to taxing authorities, customer employees, or other third parties. We refer to this investment income as float revenue.\nFor Dayforce, we primarily charge monthly recurring fees on a PEPM basis, generally one-month in advance of service, based on the number and type of solutions provided to the customer and the number of employees and other users at the customer. Our standard Dayforce contracts are generally for a three to five-year period. The average time it takes to implement Dayforce typically ranges from three months for smaller customers to nine months for larger customers. Once Dayforce is implemented, the customer goes live, and we begin to generate recurring revenue. We also provide outsourced human resource solutions to certain of our Dayforce customers, which are tailored to meet their individual needs, and entail performing the duties of a customer's human resources department, including payroll processing, time and labor management, performance management, and recruiting, as needed.\nThe Powerpay offering is our solution designed primarily for small market Canadian customers. The typical Powerpay customer has fewer than 20 employees, and the majority of the revenue is generated from recurring fees charged on a per-employee, per-process basis. Typical processes include the customer's payroll runs, year-end tax packages, and delivery of customers' remittance advices or checks. Powerpay can typically be implemented on a remote basis within one to three days, at which point we start receiving recurring fees.\nFor our Bureau solutions, we typically charge recurring fees on a per-process basis. Typical processes include the customer's payroll runs, year-end tax packages, and delivery of customers' remittance advices or checks. In addition to customers who use our payroll services, certain customers use our tax filing services on a stand-alone basis. Our outsourced human resource solutions are tailored to meet the needs of individual customers, and entail our contracting to perform many of the duties of a customer's human resources department, including payroll processing, time and labor management, performance management, and recruiting. We also perform individual services for customers, such as check printing, wage attachment and disbursement, and ACA management.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of costs to deliver our solutions. Most of these costs are recognized as incurred. Some costs of revenue are recognized in the period that a service is sold and delivered. Other costs of revenue are recognized over the period of use or in proportion to the related revenue.\nThe costs recognized as incurred consist primarily of customer service staff costs, customer technical support costs, implementation personnel costs, costs of hosting applications, consulting and purchased services, delivery services, and royalties. The costs of revenue recognized over the period of use are depreciation and amortization, rentals of facilities and equipment, and direct and incremental costs associated with deferred implementation service revenue.\nCost of recurring services revenues primarily consists of costs to provide maintenance and technical support to our customers and the costs of hosting our applications. The cost of recurring services revenues also includes compensation and other employee-related expenses for data center staff, payments to outside service providers, data center expenses, and networking expenses.\nCost of professional services and other revenues primarily consists of costs to provide implementation consulting services and training to our customers, as well as the cost of time clocks. Costs to provide implementation consulting services include compensation and other employee-related expenses for professional services staff, costs of subcontractors, and travel. Implementation consulting services are expected to continue to be primarily associated with the implementation of our Cloud solutions.\nProduct development and management expense, included in cost of revenue, consists of costs related to software development activities that do not qualify for capitalization, such as development, quality assurance, testing of new technologies, and enhancements to our existing solutions that do not result in additional functionality. Product development and management expense also includes costs related to the management of our solutions.\nDepreciation and amortization related to cost of revenue primarily consists of amortization of capitalized software.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expense\nSelling expense includes costs related to maintaining a direct marketing infrastructure and sales force and other direct marketing efforts, such as marketing events, advertising, telemarketing, direct mail, and trade shows. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Our sales and marketing expenses are expected to continue to be primarily associated with selling and marketing our Cloud solutions.\nGeneral and administrative expense includes costs that are not directly related to delivery of services, selling efforts, or product development and management, primarily consisting of corporate-level costs, such as administration, finance, legal, and human resources, as well as management fees payable to affiliates of our Sponsors, FNF and THLM, until termination of the management agreements upon IPO in April 2018. Also included in this category are depreciation, and amortization of other intangible assets not reflected in cost of revenue, the provision for doubtful accounts receivable, and net periodic pension costs.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net includes the results of transactions that are not appropriately classified in another category. These items include certain foreign currency translation gains and losses resulting mainly from intercompany receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary's functional currency, environmental reserve charges, and charges related to the impairment of asset values.\nIncome Tax Provision\nOur income tax provision represents federal, state, and international taxes on our income recognized for financial statement purposes and includes the effects of temporary differences between financial statement income and income recognized for tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as adjusted for the expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to reflect the net deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized. In assessing the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of pre-tax book income, expiration of net operating losses, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, as well as current tax laws. As of December 31, 2018, we continue to record a full valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets that are not offset by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities. In the future, if it is determined that we no longer have a requirement to record a valuation allowance against all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, the release of the valuation allowance would have a positive impact on our income tax provision.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act legislation (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted. The Tax Act amended the Code to reduce tax rates and to modify policies, credits, and deductions for businesses. For businesses, the Tax Act reduced the corporate federal tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31,

We calculate percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis by applying a fixed $1.30 Canadian dollar to $1.00 U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate to revenues originally booked in Canadian dollars for all applicable periods. \nTotal revenue increased $75.6 million, or 11.3%, to $746.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $670.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in Cloud revenue of $130.0 million, or 32.2% from $404.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $534.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Cloud revenue increase was primarily due to an increase of $106.9 million, or 31.8%, in Cloud recurring services revenue, and $23.1 million, or 33.9%, in Cloud professional services and other revenue. The increase in Cloud recurring services revenue of $106.9 million was attributable to increases of $76.0 million from new customers, add-ons, and revenue uplift from migrations of Bureau customers; $22.9 million from the migration of Bureau customers; and $20.0 million from increased float revenue related to Cloud recurring services revenue, partially offset by customer attrition of $12.0 million. The increase in Cloud revenue was partially offset by a decline in Bureau revenue of $54.4 million, or 20.4%. There was an immaterial impact on revenue due to changes in foreign currency rate fluctuations. Please refer to the table above for our revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis.\nOf the decline in Bureau revenue, approximately 58% was driven by customer attrition and approximately 42% was attributable to customer migrations to Dayforce. Excluding the impact of migrations, our annual Bureau revenue retention rate was 86.9% in 2018 and 89.7% in 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, recurring services revenue from payroll Bureau customers accounted for $161.2 million, and tax-only Bureau recurring services revenue accounted for $48.2 million. The payroll Bureau customers consist of approximately 1.5 million active users, of which approximately 1.4 million are customers that we believe could be candidates for migration to Dayforce. Some of our customers are not candidates to migrate to Dayforce due to a variety of factors, including the type of functionality that they require and their system configuration. Of the approximately 1.4 million active users that we believe could be candidates for migration to Dayforce, small businesses accounted for 21% of the total number of active users, mid-sized businesses accounted for 28% of the total number of active users, and enterprise businesses accounted for 51% of the total number of active users.\nCloud revenue by solution. The following table presents our Cloud revenue for both recurring and professional services and other, for both our Dayforce and Powerpay solution for the periods presented.\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Growth rate\nyear-over-\nyear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Growth rate\non a constant\ncurrency\nbasis\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dayforce\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 443.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 319.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Powerpay\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Cloud Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 534.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 404.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCloud revenue was $534.3 million for 2018, an increase of 32.2% when compared to 2017. Dayforce revenue grew 38.5%, and Powerpay revenue grew 8.2% in 2018 as compared to 2017. There was an immaterial impact on revenue due to changes in foreign currency rate fluctuations. Please refer to the table above for our revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis. Our new business sales to Dayforce and Powerpay customers comprised 82% of our increase in Cloud revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the remaining 18% consisted primarily of customer migration to Dayforce from our Bureau solutions. As we migrate our Bureau customers to Dayforce, we typically experience a revenue increase from such customers driven by increased product density on the Dayforce platform. This revenue increase can vary by customer, but has been 22% on average since 2016, as measured at the time of initial migration.\nFloat revenue. Investment income from invested customer trust funds included in revenue was $67.0 million and $46.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The average float balance for our customer trust funds for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3,361.5 million, compared to $3,228.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The average yield was 2.00% during the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 55 basis points compared to the average yield for the year ended December 31, 2017. Based on current investment practices, an increase in market investment rates of 100 basis points would increase float revenue by approximately $17 million over the twelve months following a rate increase. In addition to interest rate risks, we also have exposure to risks associated with changes in laws and regulations that may affect customer fund balances. For example, a change in regulations, either reducing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities, would reduce our average customer trust fund balances and float revenue. There are no incremental costs of revenue associated with increases or declines in float revenue.\nCost of revenue. Total cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $425.8 million, an increase of $18.3 million, or 4.5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Of the total $18.3 million increase, $2.1 million was attributable to IPO-related share-based compensation expense. Excluding IPO-related items, cost of revenue increased $16.2 million.\nRecurring services cost of revenue increased by $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due to additional costs incurred to support the growing Dayforce customer base, partially offset by reductions in costs to support our Bureau customers.\nThe reduction in cost of revenue for professional services and other of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to productivity improvements in implementing new customers.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 350, we are required to capitalize certain software development costs. Please refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d for further discussion of our accounting policy for internally developed software costs. Costs related to software development activities that do not qualify for capitalization, such as development, quality assurance, testing of new technologies, enhancements to our existing solutions that do not result in additional functionality, and costs related to the management of our solutions are presented as product development and management expense. The increase in product development and management expense of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, reflects increases in Dayforce product development efforts. For the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, our investment in software development was $54.9 million and $45.0 million, respectively, consisting of $29.6 million and $19.0 million of research and development expense, which is included within product development and management expense, and $25.3 million and $26.0 million of capitalized software development, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization expense associated with cost of revenue increased by $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, as we continue to capitalize Dayforce related and other development costs and subsequently amortize those costs.\nThe table below presents total gross margin and solution gross margins for the periods presented:\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin by solution:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cloud recurring services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bureau recurring services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional services and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (40.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (87.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal gross margin is defined as total gross profit as a percentage of total revenue, inclusive of product development and management costs as well as depreciation and amortization associated with cost of revenue. Gross margin for each solution in the table above is defined as total revenue less cost of revenue for the applicable solution as a percentage of total revenue for that related solution, exclusive of any product development and management or depreciation and amortization cost allocations.\nThe overall 11.3% increase in revenue outpaced the 4.5% increase in cost of revenue, and gross profit increased by $57.3 million, or 21.8%, as we continued to leverage our investment in people and processes to realize economies of scale.\nCloud recurring services gross margin was 68.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 62.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in Cloud recurring services gross margin reflects an increase in the proportion of Dayforce customers live for more than two years, which increased from 59% as of December 31, 2017 to 63% as of December 31, 2018, and was also attributable to consistent configuration of new customers, which enabled us to realize economies of scale in customer support and hosting costs. Professional services and other gross margin was (40.8)% for the year ended December 31, 2018, improving from (87.8)% for the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting an increase in profitable post go-live professional services and productivity improvements in implementing new customers.\nSelling, general, and administrative expense. Selling, general, and administrative expense increased $47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Of the total $47.7 million increase, $24.5 million was attributable to transaction expenses associated with our IPO, debt refinancing, and secondary offering, including $11.3 million in sponsor management termination fees, $6.0 million in IPO-related share-based compensation expense, $3.7 million in other IPO transactions costs, and $3.5 million in restructuring consulting expenses. Excluding transaction-related items, selling, general, and administrative expense increased $23.2 million, primarily due to sales and marketing expense, which increased by $13.4 million. We continue to invest in our sales and marketing efforts, as we drive growth in our Cloud solutions, particularly in Dayforce. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses also reflected increases in employee related costs and increased costs associated with being a public company.\nOther (income) expense, net. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $2.9 million of other income, net, compared to $7.3 million of other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The other (income) expense, net, for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, was primarily related to remeasurement gains and losses an intercompany payable denominated in a foreign currency, which was repaid in the second quarter of 2018.\nOperating profit. We realized operating profit of $52.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to an operating profit of $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Excluding the impact of $24.5 million in transaction costs within selling, general, and administrative expense, and $2.1 million in other increased share-based compensation expense related to the IPO within cost of revenue, operating profit would have been $79.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This $46.4 million increase was primarily due to a $75.6 million increase in revenue and gross margin improvement.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $83.2 million, compared to $87.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This reduction was primarily due to the refinancing of our debt, which resulted in a reduction in interest expense of $30.6 million upon the extinguishment of the Senior Notes in April 2018, representing seven fewer months of interest on the Senior Notes as compared to the prior year, partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt of $25.7 million. As of December 31, 2018, a 100 point basis increase in the London Inter-bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) rates would result in an approximately $7 million increase in our interest expense over the ensuring twelve-month period. Please refer to Note 9, Debt,\u201d for additional information.\nIncome tax expense. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had income tax expense of $7.7 million, compared to income tax benefit of $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $57.3 million increase in tax expense is primarily attributable to the $59.4 million tax benefit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities upon the initial implementation of the Tax Act.\nLoss from discontinued operations. As a result of the LifeWorks Disposition, the financial results of the LifeWorks business have been included within discontinued operations for all periods presented. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had a loss from discontinued operations of $25.8 million, compared to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, is primarily related to income tax expense incurred as a result of the LifeWorks Disposition.\nNet loss attributable to Ceridian. Net loss attributable to Ceridian was $63.4 for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to $52.3 million of expenses incurred related to our IPO, debt refinancing, and secondary offering transactions, partially offset by an increase in gross profit. Net loss attributable to Ceridian was $9.2 for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a tax benefit of approximately $59.4 million related to the 2017 tax reform legislation. Please refer to the Our History\u201d section above for additional information on the financial statement impacts of our IPO, debt refinancing, and secondary offering transactions.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, and Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 21.0% in 2018 from 17.6% in 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented.\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>
