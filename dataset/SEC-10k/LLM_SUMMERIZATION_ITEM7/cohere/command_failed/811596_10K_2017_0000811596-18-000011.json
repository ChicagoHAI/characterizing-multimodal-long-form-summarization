Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (\"MD&A\") is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Management Review of 2017 and Outlook for the Future;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Results of Operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Liquidity and Capital Resources;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>New Accounting Pronouncements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Report.\nThis information contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the company. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, we have provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure in the accompanying tables. The non-GAAP financial measures used within this presentation are value added revenue, operating income excluding non-run-rate items and ratios related thereto. These measures are presented because management uses this information to monitor and evaluate financial results and trends and believes this information to also be useful for investors.\nIn the discussion of operating results below, we refer to certain items as \"non-run-rate items.\" For purposes of such discussion, non-run-rate items are items that, while they may recur from period-to-period: (i) are particularly material to results; (ii) affect costs primarily as a result of external market factors; and (iii) may not recur in future periods if the same level of underlying performance were to occur. Non-run-rate items are part of our business and operating environment but are worthy of being highlighted for the benefit of readers of our financial statements. Our intent is to allow users of the financial statements to consider our results both in light of and separately from items such as unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses on derivatives related to fluctuations in underlying metal and energy prices and currency exchange rates, lower of cost or market inventory write-downs, non-cash impairments, the impact of discount rate changes on workers' compensation liabilities, legacy environmental expenses related to predecessor operations and gains or losses related to our voluntary employee beneficiary associations (\"VEBAs\"). For a reconciliation of operating income (loss) excluding non-run-rate items to operating income (loss), see \"Results of Operations - Segment and Business Unit Information\" below.\nTo allow users of our financial statements to consider the impact of metal cost on our Net sales, we disclose Net sales as well as \"value added revenue,\" which is Net sales less the Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal. As used in this discussion, \"Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal\" is the cost of our metal inputs at the Midwest Transaction Price of aluminum (\"Midwest Price\") plus the cost of alloying elements and any realized gains and/or losses on settled hedges related to the metal sold in the referenced period. The Midwest Price reflects supply and demand dynamics for primary aluminum in North America. For a reconciliation of value added revenue to Net sales, see \"Results of Operations - Segment and Business Unit Information\" below.\nManagement Review of 2017 and Outlook for the Future\nReview\nFor the full year 2017, we had strong operating performance and achieved record shipments, despite headwinds from aerospace supply chain destocking, lower-than-anticipated automotive build rates, competitive price pressure and construction-related disruptions at our rolling mill in Spokane, Washington (\"Trentwood\").\nGrowth in overall shipments was driven by strong demand for our general engineering and automotive applications that more than offset tempered demand for aerospace applications due to supply chain destocking. Value added revenue declined from the prior year as a result of the leaner mix and the impact of price pressure on higher value added revenue products. Sales margins were compressed on high value added products as competitive price pressure prevented pass through of the increasing contained metal costs. Favorable scrap raw material prices and our initiatives to achieve more efficient raw material utilization partially offset the impact from reduced sales margins.\nDespite the inefficiencies at Trentwood resulting from construction-related project work, overall manufacturing cost efficiency continued to improve as strong performance across our manufacturing platform more than offset Trentwood inefficiencies. Considering the extent of construction-related disruption at Trentwood during the year, our 2017 manufacturing efficiency improvement was a significant accomplishment, particularly given the step-change and record level we achieved in 2016.\nDuring the year, we continued to execute on our capital investment program to further enhance quality and efficiency, expand capacity and sustain strong competitive manufacturing capabilities. Our $75.5 million capital spending in 2017 was primarily focused on modernizing the hot line and light gauge heat treat plate equipment at Trentwood. The 2017 project work around the hot line and thin gauge heat treat plate equipment led to significant construction-related downtime, but will also have a very positive impact on quality, cost and capacity in the future. Additional capital investments will be made as we complete the $150.0 million five-year modernization program.\nIn addition to investments to support further organic growth, during the year we returned $114.5 million of cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Consistent with our capital deployment priorities, we have steadily increased our quarterly dividend over the past seven years, increasing it 11% to $0.50 per share in early 2017 and an additional 10% to $0.55 per share in early 2018.\nGoing forward, we will continue to invest in organic growth and asset integrity initiatives. In addition, we will seek complementary inorganic growth opportunities to create additional value for our shareholders. Furthermore, we will continue to return cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends and disciplined share repurchases.\nOutlook\nAs we look to our aerospace/high strength applications (\"Aero/HS products\"), we expect improving demand in 2018 and 2019 as supply chain destocking runs its course in 2018 and as airframe manufacturers continue to ramp-up build rates to address the large nine-year order backlog. In addition, the new defense budget strengthens the demand for the Joint Strike Fighter program and other military applications. We are very well-positioned in the marketplace and, with supply chain destocking moderating as we proceed through the year, we expect mid-single-digit year-over-year growth in our 2018 shipments for these applications. However, we continue to expect higher contained metal costs and competitive price pressure to continue in 2018.\nFor our automotive extrusion applications (\"Automotive Extrusions\"), North American build rates are expected to improve 1%-2% year-over-year following the 4% decline in builds in 2017. We expect mid-single digit year-over-year growth in 2018 for our automotive shipments and value added revenue.\nWe have generated a 6% compound annual growth rate in both our shipments and value added revenue for general engineering applications (\"GE products\") over the past three years driven by improving, broad-based industrial demand. We are cautiously optimistic about underlying demand for our GE products as we look forward. However, as we have previously discussed, we continue to experience price pressure on our high value-added products from both imports and increasing metal costs.\nOverall for the full year 2018, we anticipate mid-single-digit growth in total shipments and value added revenue compared to 2017. Major maintenance costs in 2018 are expected to be similar to 2017. Capital investment over the next three years, from 2018 through 2020, will remain focused on continued improvement in quality and cost efficiency. Total annual spending is expected to be approximately $80.0 million, with sustaining capital reinvestment expected to be equivalent to approximately 75% of our annual depreciation expense.\nAs we proceed through 2018 and look longer-term, we anticipate improving results driven by growing demand for our Aero/HS products, Automotive Extrusions and GE products and continued improvement in underlying manufacturing cost efficiency.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal 2017 Summary\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our reported operating income for 2017 was $150.7 million, including items that we consider to be non-run-rate, which netted to a charge of $8.4 million.

See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further information regarding segments.\nNet Sales. We reported Net sales for 2017 of $1,397.5 million, compared to $1,330.6 million for 2016 and $1,391.9 million for 2015. The increase in Net sales during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily reflected a 2% increase in Fabricated Products segment shipment volume and a 3% increase in average realized sales price per pound. Fabricated Products segment shipment volume increased due primarily to: (i) a 8.1 million pound, or 9%, increase in Automotive Extrusions primarily related to significantly higher bumper shipments and (ii) a 14.8 million pound, or 6%, increase in GE products reflecting the continued solid underlying demand for our general engineering applications, partially offset by a 10.2 million pound, or 4%, decrease in Aero/HS products due to: (i) aerospace supply chain destocking and (ii) temporary plate capacity constraints due to the installation of upgraded equipment and controls at Trentwood. The increase in average realized sales price per pound reflected a 0.12/lb, or 14%, increase in average Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal prices per pound, partially offset by a 0.06/lb, or 5%, decrease in average value added revenue per pound. The decrease in average value added revenue per pound reflected competitive price pressure on spot sales of Aero/HS and GE products and a leaner value added product mix with less volume of Aero/HS products and more volume of Automotive Extrusions and GE products. See the table in \"Segment and Business Unit Information\" below for further details.\nThe decrease in Net sales during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily reflected a 4% decrease in total average realized sales price per pound due to a $0.13/lb, or 13%, decrease in average Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal prices per pound, partially offset by a $0.04/lb, or 3%, increase in average value added revenue per pound. The increase in average value added revenue per pound reflected benefits of pricing improvements on some Aero/HS products and the benefit from lower contained metal prices on some high value added products. Fabricated Products segment shipment volume declined slightly in 2016 compared to 2015 as lower shipments of other industrial products (\"Other products\") were largely offset by an increase in shipments of GE\nproducts. Additionally, Aero/HS products and Automotive Extrusions declined slightly compared to 2015. See the table in \"Segment and Business Unit Information\" below for further details.\nCost of Products Sold, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization and Other Items. Cost of products sold, excluding depreciation and amortization and other items for 2017 totaled $1,105.3 million, or 79% of Net sales, compared to $1,019.5 million, or 77% of Net sales, in 2016 and $1,115.4 million, or 80% of Net sales, in 2015. The increase during 2017 compared to 2016 of $85.8 million was comprised of a $93.6 million increase in Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal, partially offset by a $7.8 million reduction in net manufacturing conversion and other costs. The reduction in net manufacturing conversion and other costs reflected: (i) a $10.9 million favorable impact from efficient raw material usage, primarily due to favorable scrap aluminum pricing and (ii) $1.6 million of lower energy pricing, partially offset by: (i) $3.2 million of higher planned major maintenance expense and (ii) a net $1.5 million manufacturing cost increase as incremental conversion costs associated with higher shipment volume in 2017 were mitigated by favorable manufacturing cost efficiency. Of the $93.6 million increase in Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal, $83.9 million was due to higher hedged metal prices and $9.7 million was due to higher shipment volume, as discussed in \"Net Sales\" above. See \"Segment and Business Unit Information\" below for a further discussion of the comparative results of operations for 2017 and 2016.\nThe decrease during 2016 compared to 2015 of $95.9 million was comprised of a decrease of $84.4 million related to lower Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal and a decrease of $11.5 million in net manufacturing conversion and other costs. Virtually all of the $84.4 million decrease in Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal was due to lower hedged metal prices. The $11.5 million decrease in net manufacturing conversion and other costs reflected: (i) a $14.0 million reduction in controllable manufacturing conversion costs from efficiency improvements; (ii) a $12.6 million reduction in costs resulting from coordinated efforts to increase utilization of recycled scrap aluminum in lieu of more expensive primary aluminum and alloying raw materials; and (iii) a decrease of $2.3 million from lower energy pricing. Offsetting these favorable conversion cost factors were: (i) $7.7 million of incremental costs related to a change in product mix; (ii) a $4.2 million increase in workers' compensation and benefits costs; and (iii) $5.4 million of LIFO and other charges. See \"Segment and Business Unit Information\" below for a further discussion of the comparative results of operations for 2016 and 2015.\nLower of Cost or Market Inventory Write-Down. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information on our inventory lower of cost or market value adjustments.\nUnrealized (Gain) Loss on Derivative Instruments. Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, which is included in Cost of products sold, is primarily due to changes in underlying commodity prices as well as derivative settlements and are related to our operational hedges. These hedges are intended to mitigate our exposure to changes in prices for certain products sold and consumed by us and, to a lesser extent, to mitigate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments was $(19.4) million, $(18.7) million and $3.4 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Unrealized gain in 2017 was comprised of a $20.9 million gain on aluminum hedge positions offset by a $1.4 million loss on natural gas hedge positions and $0.1 million loss on electricity hedge positions. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for details on the unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments for 2016 and 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for 2017 was $39.7 million compared to $36.0 million for 2016 and $32.4 million for 2015. The $3.7 million increase in Depreciation and amortization in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to various construction-in-progress projects being placed in service during 2017 and the second half of 2016 related to capital upgrades at several of our extrusion facilities to support automotive programs that will launch over the next few years and other manufacturing cost efficiency and quality initiatives. Approximately $3.6 million of the increase in Depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to various construction-in-progress projects being placed in service during 2016 and the second half of 2015 related to capital upgrades at several of our extrusion facilities.\nSelling, General, Administrative, Research and Development (\"SG&A and R&D\"). SG&A and R&D expense totaled $97.5 million in 2017 compared to $105.0 million in 2016. The decrease was due primarily to: (i) a $6.2 million decrease in short-term incentive compensation expense based on performance factors and modifiers; (ii) a $2.0 million decrease in salaries and benefits; and (iii) $0.6 million decrease in professional fees and services, partially offset by an increase of $1.3 million in long-term incentive compensation expense.\nSG&A and R&D expense totaled $105.0 million in 2016 compared to $88.1 million in 2015. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to increases of: (i) $9.1 million in our short-term incentive compensation expense; (ii) $2.3 million in our long-term incentive compensation expense; (iii) $1.3 million in professional fees and services; (iv) $1.4 million in management development; and (v) approximately $1.7 million in expenses for workers' compensation, environmental costs and salaries and benefits. The increase in SG&A and R&D was also due to $1.2 million of insurance settlement proceeds we received during 2015.\nNet Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost Relating to Salaried VEBA. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information regarding the Salaried VEBA.\n(Gain) Loss on Removal of Union VEBA Net Assets. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for details on the Loss on removal of Union VEBA net assets in 2015 and our estimated liability for the final remaining variable cash contribution to be paid in 2018.\nGoodwill Impairment. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further details.\nOther Operating Charges, Net. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further details.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense represents cash and non-cash interest expense incurred on our revolving credit facility, our 5.875% senior notes due 2024 (\"5.875% Senior Notes\"), our 8.25% senior notes due 2020 (\"8.25% Senior Notes\"), which were redeemed on June 1, 2016, and our 4.5% cash convertible senior notes due 2015 (\"Convertible Notes\"), which were settled on April 1, 2015, net of capitalized interest. Interest expense was $22.2 million, $20.3 million and $24.1 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, net of $2.2 million, $2.9 million and $1.8 million of interest expense capitalized as part of construction-in-progress, respectively, for the three periods. Non-cash amortization of the discount on the Convertible Notes accounted for $2.4 million of the total interest expense in 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), Net. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for details.\nIncome Tax (Provision) Benefit. The income tax provision for 2017 was $87.6 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 65.9%. The difference between the effective tax rate and the projected blended statutory tax rate for 2017 was primarily due to the passage of H.R.1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). Incremental income tax expense related to the Tax Act included: (i) $29.0 million (or 21.8% of taxable income) related to the write down of deferred tax assets to reflect the new 21% federal corporate tax rate; (ii) $5.9 million (or 4.5% of taxable income) for transition and withholding tax associated with foreign undistributed earnings, including $2.2 million of foreign withholding tax since our earnings in Canada are no longer permanently reinvested; and (iii) $2.3 million (or 1.7% of taxable income) for certain executive compensation that can no longer be deducted under the Tax Act (see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further discussion on the Tax Act).\nThe income tax provision for 2016 was $55.5 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 37.7%. There was no material difference between the effective tax rate and the projected blended statutory tax rate for 2016.\nThe income tax benefit for 2015 was $135.2 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 36.4%. The difference between the effective tax rate and the projected blended statutory tax rate for 2015 was primarily due to: (i) a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of $1.8 million (or 0.5% of taxable income); (ii) state tax rate and apportionment changes in various states resulting in an increase of $4.7 million (or 1.3% of taxable income); and (iii) an increase in the valuation allowance for federal and certain state net operating losses of $2.0 million (or 0.5% of taxable income).\nAs a result of the Tax Act, our long-term effective tax rate is estimated to be in the mid 20% range on a go-forward basis.\nSegment and Business Unit Information\nConsistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker reviews and evaluates our business, we have one operating segment, which we refer to as Fabricated Products, that produces semi-fabricated specialty aluminum products, such as aluminum plate and sheet and extruded and drawn products, for the following end market applications: Aero/HS products, Automotive Extrusions, GE products and Other products.\nWe also have a business unit, All Other, which provides general and administrative support for our operations. For purposes of segment reporting under United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), we treat the Fabricated Products segment as a reportable segment. All Other is not considered a reportable segment.\nThe following data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Report. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further information regarding segments.\nFabricated Products\nThe table below provides selected operational and financial information for our Fabricated Products segment for each period presented (in millions of dollars):\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>201.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact to segment operating income of non-run-rate items:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to plant-level LIFO1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mark-to-market gain (loss) on derivative instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash lower of cost or market inventory write-down2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' compensation benefit (cost) due to discounting\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental expenses4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-run-rate items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income excluding non-run-rate items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>205.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.\n</td> <td>We manage our Fabricated Products segment business on a monthly LIFO basis at each plant, but report inventory externally on an annual LIFO basis in accordance with GAAP on a consolidated basis.

Lower operating income excluding non-run-rate items reflected: (i) a $20.5 million unfavorable sales impact due primarily to a leaner product mix and compressed sales margins, partially offset by favorable price spreads for scrap raw material purchases; (ii) $3.6 million of higher depreciation and amortization expense; and (iii) $3.2 million of higher planned major maintenance expense, partially offset by: (i) a $4.7 million improvement in net manufacturing conversion and other costs; (ii) a $5.0 million decrease in overhead and other benefits and costs; (iii) a $2.2 million decrease in incentive compensation expense; and (iv) $1.6 million of lower energy pricing.\nSegment operating income excluding non-run-rate items for 2016 was $27.2 million higher than segment operating income excluding such items for 2015. The increase primarily reflected: (i) a $15.3 million favorable sales impact; (ii) a $14.0 million improvement in controllable manufacturing conversion costs; (iii) $12.6 million of favorable impact from coordinated efforts by our metal procurement group and manufacturing operations to increase utilization of recycled scrap aluminum in lieu of more expensive primary aluminum and alloying raw materials; and (iv) a $2.3 million benefit from lower energy prices. These favorable impacts were partially offset by: (i) a $5.3 million increase in incentive compensation expense; (ii) a $3.7 million increase in workers' compensation expense; (iii) a $4.6 million increase in overhead and other benefits and costs; and (iv) $3.5 million of higher depreciation expense.

Cash used in investing activities during 2016 of $200.6 million primarily consisted of $200.1 million net cash outflow in conducting investment activities with respect to our available for sale securities and capital expenditures of $0.5 million. Cash provided by investing activities during 2015 of $82.8 million primarily consisted of proceeds from the disposition of available for sale securities. A portion of the proceeds was used to settle the Convertible Notes on April 1, 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nFabricated Products - Cash used in financing activities was insignificant during 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nAll Other - Cash used in financing activities in 2017 was $119.0 million, representing: (i) $79.5 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program; (ii) $35.0 million of cash dividends paid to stockholders, including the holders of restricted stock, and in dividend equivalents to the holders of certain restricted stock units; and (iii) $4.5 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock to satisfy withholding taxes resulting from the vesting of employee restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2016 was $94.8 million, representing $375.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of our 5.875% Senior Notes and $1.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by: (i) $206.0 million for the redemption of the 8.25% Senior Notes; (ii) $32.4 million of cash dividends paid to our stockholders, including holders of restricted stock, and dividend equivalents paid to holders of certain restricted stock units and to holders of performance shares granted prior to 2014, with respect to the target number of underlying shares of common stock (constituting approximately one-half of the maximum payout); (iii) $33.3 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program; (iv) $6.8 million of debt issuance costs; and (v) $2.9 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock to satisfy withholding taxes resulting from the vesting of employee restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares.\nCash used in financing activities in 2015 was $284.4 million, representing: (i) net cash outlay of $175.0 million to settle the Convertible Notes; (ii) $49.2 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program; (iii) $28.1 million of cash dividends paid to our stockholders, including holders of restricted stock, and dividend equivalents paid to holders of certain restricted stock units and to holders of performance shares granted prior to 2014, with respect to the target number of underlying shares of common stock (constituting approximately one-half of the maximum payout); (iv) a $30.0 million payment related to the repurchase of $27.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.25% Senior Notes; (v) $2.8 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock to satisfy withholding taxes resulting from the vesting of employee restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares; and (vi) $0.6 million of cash paid for financing costs related to the renewal of our Revolving Credit Facility. Cash used in financing activities in 2015 was partially offset by $1.3 million of additional tax benefit in connection with the vesting of employee non-vested shares, restricted stock units and performance shares.\nSources of Liquidity\nWe believe our available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and funds generated from operations are our most significant sources of liquidity. While we believe these sources will be sufficient to finance our working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures and investments, debt service obligations and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months, our ability to fund such cash requirements will depend upon our future operating performance (which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions) and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility matures in December 2020 and provides for borrowings up to $300.0 million (subject to borrowing base limitations), of which up to a maximum of $20.0 million may be utilized for letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility may, subject to certain conditions and the agreement of lenders thereunder, be increased up to $400.0 million.\nThe table below summarizes recent availability and usage of our Revolving Credit Facility (in millions of dollars except for borrowing rate):\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>February 15, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving Credit Facility borrowing commitment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowing base availability\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Outstanding borrowings under Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Outstanding letters of credit under Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net remaining borrowing availability\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowing rate (if applicable)1\n</td> <td>4.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.\n</td> <td>Such borrowing rate, if applicable, represents the interest rate for any overnight borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We do not believe that covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility are reasonably likely to limit our ability to raise additional debt or equity should we choose to do so during the next 12 months, nor do we believe it is likely that during the next 12 months we will trigger the availability threshold that would require measuring and maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio.\nSee Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for a description of our Revolving Credit Facility.\nDebt\nSee \"Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements - Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\" below for mandatory principal and cash interest payments on the outstanding borrowings under the 5.875% Senior Notes. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further details with respect to the 5.875% Senior Notes and the redemption of our 8.25% Senior Notes.\nWe do not believe that covenants in the indenture governing the 5.875% Senior Notes are reasonably likely to limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing should we choose to do so during the next 12 months.\nCapital Expenditures and Investments\nWe strive to strengthen our competitive position through strategic capital investment. Significant investments over the past decade have positioned us well with increased capacity and expanded manufacturing capabilities while more recent capital projects have focused on further improving product quality and manufacturing cost efficiency, which we believe are critical to maintaining and strengthening our position in an increasingly competitive market environment over the coming decade.\nThe Trentwood efficiency and modernization initiative is a multi-year, $150.0 million capital investment initiative to upgrade equipment throughout the Trentwood process flow to reduce conversion costs, increase efficiency and further improve our competitive cost position on all of Trentwood's products. To differentiate our product quality, the modernization will also replace legacy equipment and improve the process flow for thin gauge plate to achieve KaiserSelect\u00ae quality enhancements for\nboth Aero/HS and GE products. A byproduct of the manufacturing efficiency improvements from upgrades completed during 2017 is incremental manufacturing capacity to enable sales growth in 2018 and beyond. The Trentwood modernization initiative was announced in December 2015 and will span several years. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 40% of the total $150.0 million capital investment remained to be spent.\nTotal capital expenditures were $75.5 million, $76.1 million and $63.1 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A significant portion of our capital spending during 2017 and 2016 was related to the Trentwood modernization project. Additionally, in all three years, we invested to support our automotive growth initiative, including upgrades to existing extrusion presses at several of our automotive-focused facilities, a new extrusion press at our London, Ontario facility in 2015 and a new extrusion press and related equipment at our Sherman, Texas facility in 2015 and 2016. The remainder of our capital spending in all three years was allocated among our manufacturing locations on projects expected to reduce operating costs, improve quality, increase capacity or enhance operational security.\nWe anticipate our capital spending in 2018 will be approximately $80.0 million and include continued spending on the Trentwood modernization and spending at multiple locations for efficiency improvements and operational security. Capital investment will be funded using cash generated from operations, available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or other third-party financing arrangements. The level of anticipated capital expenditures may be adjusted from time to time depending on our business plans, our price outlook for fabricated aluminum products, our ability to maintain adequate liquidity and other factors. No assurance can be provided as to the timing of any such expenditures or the operational benefits expected therefrom.\nDividends\nSee Note 13 and Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding dividends paid during 2017, 2016 and 2015, and declared subsequent to December 31, 2017. See Item 5 of this Report for disclosure regarding the future declaration and payment of dividends.\nRepurchases of Common Stock\nSee Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding repurchases of common stock in 2017 and 2016 and the amounts authorized and available for future repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase program.\nSee Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding minimum statutory tax withholding obligations arising during 2017, 2016 and 2015 in connection with the vesting of non-vested shares, restricted stock units and performance shares.\nRestrictions Related to Equity Capital\nAs discussed elsewhere in this Report, to preserve our ability to fully use our net operating loss carryforwards and other significant tax attributes, we have: (i) adopted a tax asset protection rights plan (\"Tax Asset Rights Plan\"), which is designed to deter transfers of our common stock that could result in an ownership change pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (\"Code\") and (ii) implemented stock transfer restrictions (\"Transfer Restrictions\"), which restrict transfers of our stock by any person who owns, or would become an owner of, 4.99% or more of our stock as determined under Section 382 of the Code. The Tax Asset Rights Plan will expire on April 7, 2019, and the Transfer Restrictions will expire on May 26, 2019.\nEnvironmental Commitments and Contingencies\nSee Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding our environmental commitments and contingencies.\nContractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table and discussion provide a summary of our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December

</tr>\n</table>\nPrincipal and Interest on 5.875% Senior Notes. Cash outlays related to our 5.875% Senior Notes consist of our principal obligations and interest obligations based on scheduled interest payments.\nStandby Letters of Credit. Of the $8.4 million of standby letters of credit, $0.3 million are cash collateralized and $8.1 million represents letters of credit issued under our Revolving Credit Facility. The letters of credit provide financial assurance of our payment of obligations, primarily related to workers' compensation and environmental compliance. The specific timing of payments with respect to such matters is uncertain. The letters of credit generally automatically renew every 12 months and terminate when the underlying obligations no longer require assurance or upon the maturity of our Revolving Credit Facility in September 2020 (for those letters of credit issued under that facility).\nUncertain Tax Liabilities. At December 31, 2017, we had uncertain tax positions which ultimately could result in tax payments. As the amount of ultimate tax payments beyond 2018 is contingent on the tax authorities' assessment, it is not practical to present annual payment information.\nDeferred Compensation Plan Liability. The deferred compensation liability amount relates to our deferred compensation plan for certain key employees. As the distribution amount is contingent upon investment performance, vesting and other eligibility requirements, including retirement dates, it is not practical to present annual payment information.\nCapital Leases. Capital lease spending represents non-cancelable capital commitments as of December 31, 2017. We expect capital leases to be funded through available cash generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and/or other third-party financing arrangements.\nVEBA Obligations. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information regarding our variable cash contributions to the VEBAs.\nPurchase Obligations. Cash outlays for purchase obligations consist primarily of commitments to purchase aluminum, energy and equipment. We have various contracts with suppliers of aluminum that require us to purchase minimum quantities of aluminum in future years at a price to be determined at the time of purchase based primarily on the underlying metal price at that time. Amounts included in the table are based on minimum quantities at the metal price at December 31, 2017. We believe the minimum quantities are lower than our current requirements for aluminum. Actual quantities and actual metal prices at the time of purchase could be different. Physical delivery commitments with energy companies are in place to cover our exposure to fluctuations in electricity and natural gas prices and are based on fixed contractual rates and quantities. Equipment purchase obligations are based on scheduled payments to equipment manufacturers.\nOperating Leases. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain manufacturing facilities, warehouses, office space and equipment.\nCommitment Fees on Revolving Credit Facility. Future commitment fees on our Revolving Credit Facility are estimated based on the amount of unused credit under the facility at December 31, 2017 and assuming no extension of terms beyond the current maturity date of our Revolving Credit Facility, which is in December 2020. No borrowings were outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility either throughout the year or as of December 31, 2017.\nOther Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn addition to our off-balance sheet items discussed in the contractual obligations and commercial commitments section above:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding our participation in multi-employer pension plans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding our long-term employee incentive plans.

In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.\nIn addition to the accounting estimates we discuss in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report, management believes that the following accounting estimates are critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Judgments and Uncertainties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Potential Effect If Actual Results\nDiffer From Assumptions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Self-insured workers' compensation liabilities.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>We are primarily self-insured for workers' compensation benefits provided to employees.

We consider our historical experience, severity factors, actuarial analysis and existing stop loss insurance in estimating our ultimate insurance liability. In addition, since recorded obligations represent the present value of expected payments over the life of the claims, decreases in the discount rate (used to compute the present value of the payments) would cause the estimated obligations to increase. Conversely, an increase in the discount rate would cause the estimated present value of expected payments to decrease. If our workers' compensation claim trends were to differ significantly from our historic claims experience and as the discount rate changes, we would make a corresponding adjustment to our workers' compensation accruals.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>The rate used to discount future estimated workers' compensation liabilities is determined based on the U.S. Treasury bond rate with a five-year maturity date which resembles the remaining estimated life of the workers' compensation claims.

In order to determine the effective tax rate to apply to interim periods, estimates and judgments are made (by taxable jurisdiction) as to the amount of taxable income that may be generated, the availability of deductions and credits expected and the availability of net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes to offset taxable income.\nMaking such estimates and judgments is subject to inherent uncertainties given the difficulty of predicting future tax rates, market conditions, customer requirements, the cost for key inputs such as energy and primary aluminum, overall operating efficiency and other factors. However, if, among other things: (i) actual results vary from our forecasts due to one or more of the factors cited above or elsewhere in this Report; (ii) income is distributed differently than expected among tax jurisdictions; (iii) one or more material events or transactions occur which were not contemplated; or (iv) certain expected deductions, credits or carryforwards are not available, it is possible that the effective tax rate for a year could vary materially from the assessments used to prepare the interim consolidated financial statements. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional discussion of these matters.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as well as on an interim basis as events and changes in circumstances occur.\nIn January 2017, we prospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which eliminates the second step of the two-step goodwill impairment test that required companies to determine the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit to measure goodwill impairment.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets acquired are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, to reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed. In the event the pattern cannot be reliably determined, we use a straight-line amortization method.

Additionally, as of December 31, 2017, we do not believe any of our reporting units are at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and fair values assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we may be exposed to losses from impairment charges that could be material.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Judgments and Uncertainties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Potential Effect If Actual Results\nDiffer From Assumptions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaried VEBA.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At December 31, 2017, our financial statements include the Salaried VEBA, which we are required to reflect on our financial statements as a defined benefit postretirement plan, despite our limited legal obligations to the Salaried VEBA in regards to that plan. Liabilities and expenses for postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the long-term rate of return (\"LTRR\") on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (i.e., retirement age and mortality). The most significant assumptions used in determining the estimated year-end obligations include the assumed discount rate and the LTRR.\nIn addition to the above assumptions used in the actuarial valuation, changes in plan provisions could also have a material impact on the net funded status of the Salaried VEBA. Our obligation to the Salaried VEBA is to pay an annual variable contribution amount based on the level of our cash flow. The funding status of the Salaried VEBA has no impact on our annual variable contribution amount. We have no control over any aspect of the plan. We rely on information provided to us by the Salaried VEBA administrator with respect to specific plan provisions such as annual benefits expected to be paid. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information on our benefit plans.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Since the recorded obligation represents the present value of expected postretirement benefit payments over the life of the plan, decreases in the discount rate (used to compute the present value of the payments) would cause the estimated obligation to increase. Conversely, an increase in the discount rate would cause the estimated present value of the obligation to decline.\nThe LTRR on plan assets reflects an assumption regarding what the amount of earnings would be on existing plan assets (before considering any future contributions to the plan). Increases in the assumed LTRR would cause the projected value of plan assets available to satisfy postretirement obligations to increase, yielding a reduced net expense of these obligations. A reduction in the LTRR would reduce the amount of projected net assets available to satisfy postretirement obligations and, thus, cause the net expense of these obligations to increase.\nA change in plan provisions could cause the estimated obligations to change. An increase in annual benefits expected to be paid would increase the estimated present value of the obligations and conversely, a decrease in annual benefits expected to be paid would decrease the estimated present value of the obligations.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>The rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined taking into consideration the rates available at year-end on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan. In relation to the Salaried VEBA, a change in the discount rate of 1/4 of 1% would impact the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $2.2 million, impact service and interest costs by $0.1 million and have an immaterial impact on 2018 expense. The LTRR on plan assets is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations. A change in the assumption for LTRR on plan assets of 1/4 of 1% would impact expense by approximately $0.1 million in 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (\"MD&A\") is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections:\n \u2022 Management Review of 2017 and Outlook for the Future; \n \u2022 Results of Operations; \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources; \n \u2022 Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements; \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies; and \n \u2022 New Accounting Pronouncements.  Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Report.\nThis information contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the company. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, we have provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure in the accompanying tables. The non-GAAP financial measures used within this presentation are value added revenue, operating income excluding non-run-rate items and ratios related thereto. These measures are presented because management uses this information to monitor and evaluate financial results and trends and believes this information to also be useful for investors.\nIn the discussion of operating results below, we refer to certain items as \"non-run-rate items.\" For purposes of such discussion, non-run-rate items are items that, while they may recur from period-to-period: (i) are particularly material to results; (ii) affect costs primarily as a result of external market factors; and (iii) may not recur in future periods if the same level of underlying performance were to occur. Non-run-rate items are part of our business and operating environment but are worthy of being highlighted for the benefit of readers of our financial statements. Our intent is to allow users of the financial statements to consider our results both in light of and separately from items such as unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses on derivatives related to fluctuations in underlying metal and energy prices and currency exchange rates, lower of cost or market inventory write-downs, non-cash impairments, the impact of discount rate changes on workers' compensation liabilities, legacy environmental expenses related to predecessor operations and gains or losses related to our voluntary employee beneficiary associations (\"VEBAs\"). For a reconciliation of operating income (loss) excluding non-run-rate items to operating income (loss), see \"Results of Operations - Segment and Business Unit Information\" below.\nTo allow users of our financial statements to consider the impact of metal cost on our Net sales, we disclose Net sales as well as \"value added revenue,\" which is Net sales less the Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal. As used in this discussion, \"Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal\" is the cost of our metal inputs at the Midwest Transaction Price of aluminum (\"Midwest Price\") plus the cost of alloying elements and any realized gains and/or losses on settled hedges related to the metal sold in the referenced period. The Midwest Price reflects supply and demand dynamics for primary aluminum in North America. For a reconciliation of value added revenue to Net sales, see \"Results of Operations - Segment and Business Unit Information\" below.\nManagement Review of 2017 and Outlook for the Future\nReview\nFor the full year 2017, we had strong operating performance and achieved record shipments, despite headwinds from aerospace supply chain destocking, lower-than-anticipated automotive build rates, competitive price pressure and construction-related disruptions at our rolling mill in Spokane, Washington (\"Trentwood\").\nGrowth in overall shipments was driven by strong demand for our general engineering and automotive applications that more than offset tempered demand for aerospace applications due to supply chain destocking. Value added revenue declined from the prior year as a result of the leaner mix and the impact of price pressure on higher value added revenue products. Sales margins were compressed on high value added products as competitive price pressure prevented pass through of the increasing contained metal costs. Favorable scrap raw material prices and our initiatives to achieve more efficient raw material utilization partially offset the impact from reduced sales margins.\nDespite the inefficiencies at Trentwood resulting from construction-related project work, overall manufacturing cost efficiency continued to improve as strong performance across our manufacturing platform more than offset Trentwood inefficiencies. Considering the extent of construction-related disruption at Trentwood during the year, our 2017 manufacturing efficiency improvement was a significant accomplishment, particularly given the step-change and record level we achieved in 2016.\nDuring the year, we continued to execute on our capital investment program to further enhance quality and efficiency, expand capacity and sustain strong competitive manufacturing capabilities. Our $75.5 million capital spending in 2017 was primarily focused on modernizing the hot line and light gauge heat treat plate equipment at Trentwood. The 2017 project work around the hot line and thin gauge heat treat plate equipment led to significant construction-related downtime, but will also have a very positive impact on quality, cost and capacity in the future. Additional capital investments will be made as we complete the $150.0 million five-year modernization program.\nIn addition to investments to support further organic growth, during the year we returned $114.5 million of cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Consistent with our capital deployment priorities, we have steadily increased our quarterly dividend over the past seven years, increasing it 11% to $0.50 per share in early 2017 and an additional 10% to $0.55 per share in early 2018.\nGoing forward, we will continue to invest in organic growth and asset integrity initiatives. In addition, we will seek complementary inorganic growth opportunities to create additional value for our shareholders. Furthermore, we will continue to return cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends and disciplined share repurchases.\nOutlook\nAs we look to our aerospace/high strength applications (\"Aero/HS products\"), we expect improving demand in 2018 and 2019 as supply chain destocking runs its course in 2018 and as airframe manufacturers continue to ramp-up build rates to address the large nine-year order backlog. In addition, the new defense budget strengthens the demand for the Joint Strike Fighter program and other military applications. We are very well-positioned in the marketplace and, with supply chain destocking moderating as we proceed through the year, we expect mid-single-digit year-over-year growth in our 2018 shipments for these applications. However, we continue to expect higher contained metal costs and competitive price pressure to continue in 2018.\nFor our automotive extrusion applications (\"Automotive Extrusions\"), North American build rates are expected to improve 1%-2% year-over-year following the 4% decline in builds in 2017. We expect mid-single digit year-over-year growth in 2018 for our automotive shipments and value added revenue.\nWe have generated a 6% compound annual growth rate in both our shipments and value added revenue for general engineering applications (\"GE products\") over the past three years driven by improving, broad-based industrial demand. We are cautiously optimistic about underlying demand for our GE products as we look forward. However, as we have previously discussed, we continue to experience price pressure on our high value-added products from both imports and increasing metal costs.\nOverall for the full year 2018, we anticipate mid-single-digit growth in total shipments and value added revenue compared to 2017. Major maintenance costs in 2018 are expected to be similar to 2017. Capital investment over the next three years, from 2018 through 2020, will remain focused on continued improvement in quality and cost efficiency. Total annual spending is expected to be approximately $80.0 million, with sustaining capital reinvestment expected to be equivalent to approximately 75% of our annual depreciation expense.\nAs we proceed through 2018 and look longer-term, we anticipate improving results driven by growing demand for our Aero/HS products, Automotive Extrusions and GE products and continued improvement in underlying manufacturing cost efficiency.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal 2017 Summary\n \u2022 Our reported operating income for 2017 was $150.7 million, including items that we consider to be non-run-rate, which netted to a charge of $8.4 million. See \"Segment and Business Unit Information\" below for further discussion of our operating income before non-run-rate items. \n \u2022 We recorded incremental income tax expense of $37.2 million due to tax law changes enacted in December 2017, which, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The tax rate reduction required that we reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax assets related to our net operating loss carryforwards and caused the majority of the incremental tax expense. \n \u2022 Our liquidity was approximately $526.7 million as of December 31, 2017, comprised of our cash balances, short-term investments and net borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility (on which there were no outstanding borrowings). \n \u2022 We invested $75.5 million in capital spending for further growth, manufacturing efficiency, quality and operational security. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Expenditures and Investments\" below. \n \u2022 In 2017, we paid $2.9 million to the Salaried VEBA and $17.1 million to the Union VEBA for our cash contributions with respect to 2016. In 2018, we expect to pay another $2.9 million to the Salaried VEBA with respect to 2017 and $12.8 million to the Union VEBA with respect to the nine months ended September 30, 2017. This $12.8 million payment will be our final cash contribution to the Union VEBA. \n \u2022 We paid a total of approximately $35.0 million, or $2.00 per common share, in cash dividends to stockholders, including holders of restricted stock, and dividend equivalents to holders of certain restricted stock units. \n \u2022 We repurchased 938,680 shares of common stock in 2017 for a total cost of $77.8 million pursuant to a stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors.  Consolidated Selected Operational and Financial Information\nThe following data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Report. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further information regarding segments.\nNet Sales. We reported Net sales for 2017 of $1,397.5 million, compared to $1,330.6 million for 2016 and $1,391.9 million for 2015. The increase in Net sales during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily reflected a 2% increase in Fabricated Products segment shipment volume and a 3% increase in average realized sales price per pound. Fabricated Products segment shipment volume increased due primarily to: (i) a 8.1 million pound, or 9%, increase in Automotive Extrusions primarily related to significantly higher bumper shipments and (ii) a 14.8 million pound, or 6%, increase in GE products reflecting the continued solid underlying demand for our general engineering applications, partially offset by a 10.2 million pound, or 4%, decrease in Aero/HS products due to: (i) aerospace supply chain destocking and (ii) temporary plate capacity constraints due to the installation of upgraded equipment and controls at Trentwood. The increase in average realized sales price per pound reflected a 0.12/lb, or 14%, increase in average Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal prices per pound, partially offset by a 0.06/lb, or 5%, decrease in average value added revenue per pound. The decrease in average value added revenue per pound reflected competitive price pressure on spot sales of Aero/HS and GE products and a leaner value added product mix with less volume of Aero/HS products and more volume of Automotive Extrusions and GE products. See the table in \"Segment and Business Unit Information\" below for further details.\nThe decrease in Net sales during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily reflected a 4% decrease in total average realized sales price per pound due to a $0.13/lb, or 13%, decrease in average Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal prices per pound, partially offset by a $0.04/lb, or 3%, increase in average value added revenue per pound. The increase in average value added revenue per pound reflected benefits of pricing improvements on some Aero/HS products and the benefit from lower contained metal prices on some high value added products. Fabricated Products segment shipment volume declined slightly in 2016 compared to 2015 as lower shipments of other industrial products (\"Other products\") were largely offset by an increase in shipments of GE\nproducts. Additionally, Aero/HS products and Automotive Extrusions declined slightly compared to 2015. See the table in \"Segment and Business Unit Information\" below for further details.\nCost of Products Sold, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization and Other Items. Cost of products sold, excluding depreciation and amortization and other items for 2017 totaled $1,105.3 million, or 79% of Net sales, compared to $1,019.5 million, or 77% of Net sales, in 2016 and $1,115.4 million, or 80% of Net sales, in 2015. The increase during 2017 compared to 2016 of $85.8 million was comprised of a $93.6 million increase in Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal, partially offset by a $7.8 million reduction in net manufacturing conversion and other costs. The reduction in net manufacturing conversion and other costs reflected: (i) a $10.9 million favorable impact from efficient raw material usage, primarily due to favorable scrap aluminum pricing and (ii) $1.6 million of lower energy pricing, partially offset by: (i) $3.2 million of higher planned major maintenance expense and (ii) a net $1.5 million manufacturing cost increase as incremental conversion costs associated with higher shipment volume in 2017 were mitigated by favorable manufacturing cost efficiency. Of the $93.6 million increase in Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal, $83.9 million was due to higher hedged metal prices and $9.7 million was due to higher shipment volume, as discussed in \"Net Sales\" above. See \"Segment and Business Unit Information\" below for a further discussion of the comparative results of operations for 2017 and 2016.\nThe decrease during 2016 compared to 2015 of $95.9 million was comprised of a decrease of $84.4 million related to lower Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal and a decrease of $11.5 million in net manufacturing conversion and other costs. Virtually all of the $84.4 million decrease in Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal was due to lower hedged metal prices. The $11.5 million decrease in net manufacturing conversion and other costs reflected: (i) a $14.0 million reduction in controllable manufacturing conversion costs from efficiency improvements; (ii) a $12.6 million reduction in costs resulting from coordinated efforts to increase utilization of recycled scrap aluminum in lieu of more expensive primary aluminum and alloying raw materials; and (iii) a decrease of $2.3 million from lower energy pricing. Offsetting these favorable conversion cost factors were: (i) $7.7 million of incremental costs related to a change in product mix; (ii) a $4.2 million increase in workers' compensation and benefits costs; and (iii) $5.4 million of LIFO and other charges. See \"Segment and Business Unit Information\" below for a further discussion of the comparative results of operations for 2016 and 2015.\nLower of Cost or Market Inventory Write-Down. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information on our inventory lower of cost or market value adjustments.\nUnrealized (Gain) Loss on Derivative Instruments. Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, which is included in Cost of products sold, is primarily due to changes in underlying commodity prices as well as derivative settlements and are related to our operational hedges. These hedges are intended to mitigate our exposure to changes in prices for certain products sold and consumed by us and, to a lesser extent, to mitigate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments was $(19.4) million, $(18.7) million and $3.4 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Unrealized gain in 2017 was comprised of a $20.9 million gain on aluminum hedge positions offset by a $1.4 million loss on natural gas hedge positions and $0.1 million loss on electricity hedge positions. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for details on the unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments for 2016 and 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for 2017 was $39.7 million compared to $36.0 million for 2016 and $32.4 million for 2015. The $3.7 million increase in Depreciation and amortization in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to various construction-in-progress projects being placed in service during 2017 and the second half of 2016 related to capital upgrades at several of our extrusion facilities to support automotive programs that will launch over the next few years and other manufacturing cost efficiency and quality initiatives. Approximately $3.6 million of the increase in Depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to various construction-in-progress projects being placed in service during 2016 and the second half of 2015 related to capital upgrades at several of our extrusion facilities.\nSelling, General, Administrative, Research and Development (\"SG&A and R&D\"). SG&A and R&D expense totaled $97.5 million in 2017 compared to $105.0 million in 2016. The decrease was due primarily to: (i) a $6.2 million decrease in short-term incentive compensation expense based on performance factors and modifiers; (ii) a $2.0 million decrease in salaries and benefits; and (iii) $0.6 million decrease in professional fees and services, partially offset by an increase of $1.3 million in long-term incentive compensation expense.\nSG&A and R&D expense totaled $105.0 million in 2016 compared to $88.1 million in 2015. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to increases of: (i) $9.1 million in our short-term incentive compensation expense; (ii) $2.3 million in our long-term incentive compensation expense; (iii) $1.3 million in professional fees and services; (iv) $1.4 million in management development; and (v) approximately $1.7 million in expenses for workers' compensation, environmental costs and salaries and benefits. The increase in SG&A and R&D was also due to $1.2 million of insurance settlement proceeds we received during 2015.\nNet Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost Relating to Salaried VEBA. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information regarding the Salaried VEBA.\n(Gain) Loss on Removal of Union VEBA Net Assets. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for details on the Loss on removal of Union VEBA net assets in 2015 and our estimated liability for the final remaining variable cash contribution to be paid in 2018.\nGoodwill Impairment. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further details.\nOther Operating Charges, Net. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further details.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense represents cash and non-cash interest expense incurred on our revolving credit facility, our 5.875% senior notes due 2024 (\"5.875% Senior Notes\"), our 8.25% senior notes due 2020 (\"8.25% Senior Notes\"), which were redeemed on June 1, 2016, and our 4.5% cash convertible senior notes due 2015 (\"Convertible Notes\"), which were settled on April 1, 2015, net of capitalized interest. Interest expense was $22.2 million, $20.3 million and $24.1 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, net of $2.2 million, $2.9 million and $1.8 million of interest expense capitalized as part of construction-in-progress, respectively, for the three periods. Non-cash amortization of the discount on the Convertible Notes accounted for $2.4 million of the total interest expense in 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), Net. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for details.\nIncome Tax (Provision) Benefit. The income tax provision for 2017 was $87.6 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 65.9%. The difference between the effective tax rate and the projected blended statutory tax rate for 2017 was primarily due to the passage of H.R.1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). Incremental income tax expense related to the Tax Act included: (i) $29.0 million (or 21.8% of taxable income) related to the write down of deferred tax assets to reflect the new 21% federal corporate tax rate; (ii) $5.9 million (or 4.5% of taxable income) for transition and withholding tax associated with foreign undistributed earnings, including $2.2 million of foreign withholding tax since our earnings in Canada are no longer permanently reinvested; and (iii) $2.3 million (or 1.7% of taxable income) for certain executive compensation that can no longer be deducted under the Tax Act (see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further discussion on the Tax Act).\nThe income tax provision for 2016 was $55.5 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 37.7%. There was no material difference between the effective tax rate and the projected blended statutory tax rate for 2016.\nThe income tax benefit for 2015 was $135.2 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 36.4%. The difference between the effective tax rate and the projected blended statutory tax rate for 2015 was primarily due to: (i) a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of $1.8 million (or 0.5% of taxable income); (ii) state tax rate and apportionment changes in various states resulting in an increase of $4.7 million (or 1.3% of taxable income); and (iii) an increase in the valuation allowance for federal and certain state net operating losses of $2.0 million (or 0.5% of taxable income).\nAs a result of the Tax Act, our long-term effective tax rate is estimated to be in the mid 20% range on a go-forward basis.\nSegment and Business Unit Information\nConsistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker reviews and evaluates our business, we have one operating segment, which we refer to as Fabricated Products, that produces semi-fabricated specialty aluminum products, such as aluminum plate and sheet and extruded and drawn products, for the following end market applications: Aero/HS products, Automotive Extrusions, GE products and Other products.\nWe also have a business unit, All Other, which provides general and administrative support for our operations. For purposes of segment reporting under United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), we treat the Fabricated Products segment as a reportable segment. All Other is not considered a reportable segment.\nThe following data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Report. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further information regarding segments.\nFabricated Products\nThe table below provides selected operational and financial information for our Fabricated Products segment for each period presented (in millions of dollars):\n\n_____________________\n 1. We manage our Fabricated Products segment business on a monthly LIFO basis at each plant, but report inventory externally on an annual LIFO basis in accordance with GAAP on a consolidated basis. This amount represents the conversion from GAAP LIFO applied on a consolidated basis for the Fabricated Products segment to monthly LIFO applied on a plant-by-plant basis. \n 2. The $4.9 million lower of cost or market inventory write-down in 2016 was due primarily to a decrease in our net realizable value of inventory (less a normal profit margin). The $2.6 million lower of cost or market inventory write-down in 2015 was due primarily to declining metal prices. \n 3. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information relating to the impairment of goodwill and one of our customer relationship intangible assets. \n 4. Non-run-rate environmental expenses within Fabricated Products are related to activities that occurred at operating facilities prior to July 6, 2006, while such facilities were occupied by a predecessor. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information relating to the environmental expenses.  As noted above, segment operating income excluding non-run-rate items for 2017 was $13.8 million lower than segment operating income excluding such items for 2016. Lower operating income excluding non-run-rate items reflected: (i) a $20.5 million unfavorable sales impact due primarily to a leaner product mix and compressed sales margins, partially offset by favorable price spreads for scrap raw material purchases; (ii) $3.6 million of higher depreciation and amortization expense; and (iii) $3.2 million of higher planned major maintenance expense, partially offset by: (i) a $4.7 million improvement in net manufacturing conversion and other costs; (ii) a $5.0 million decrease in overhead and other benefits and costs; (iii) a $2.2 million decrease in incentive compensation expense; and (iv) $1.6 million of lower energy pricing.\nSegment operating income excluding non-run-rate items for 2016 was $27.2 million higher than segment operating income excluding such items for 2015. The increase primarily reflected: (i) a $15.3 million favorable sales impact; (ii) a $14.0 million improvement in controllable manufacturing conversion costs; (iii) $12.6 million of favorable impact from coordinated efforts by our metal procurement group and manufacturing operations to increase utilization of recycled scrap aluminum in lieu of more expensive primary aluminum and alloying raw materials; and (iv) a $2.3 million benefit from lower energy prices. These favorable impacts were partially offset by: (i) a $5.3 million increase in incentive compensation expense; (ii) a $3.7 million increase in workers' compensation expense; (iii) a $4.6 million increase in overhead and other benefits and costs; and (iv) $3.5 million of higher depreciation expense. The favorable sales impact reflected expanded sales margins due to price improvements on certain Aero/HS products, as well as lower contained metal prices on certain high value added products.\nThe table below provides our Fabricated Products segment shipment and value added revenue information (in millions of dollars, except shipments and value added revenue per pound) by end market applications for each period presented:\n\nFor 2017, Net sales of Fabricated Products increased by $66.9 million to $1,397.5 million, as compared to 2016, primarily reflecting a 3% increase in total average realized sales price per pound and a 2% increase in Fabricated Products segment shipments. See \"Consolidated Selected Operational and Financial Information\" above for further discussion.\nThe decrease in Net sales of Fabricated Products during 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to a 4% decrease in total average realized sales price per pound and a slight decrease in Fabricated Products segment shipments. See \"Consolidated Selected Operational and Financial Information\" above for further discussion.\nAll Other\nAll Other provides support for our operations and incurs general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to the Fabricated Products segment. All Other is not considered a reportable segment. The table below presents the impact of non-run-rate items to operating loss within the All Other business unit for each period presented (in millions of dollars):\n\n_______________________\n 1. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information relating to the VEBAs. \n 2. Non-run-rate environmental expense adjustments within All Other is related to activities that occurred at non-operating facilities prior to July 6, 2006, while such facilities were occupied by a predecessor. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information relating to the environmental expenses.  All Other operating loss excluding non-run-rate items for 2017 was $2.4 million lower than in 2016 due primarily to a decrease in employee incentive compensation expense.\nAll Other operating loss excluding non-run-rate items for 2016 was $7.2 million higher than in 2015 due primarily to: (i) an increase of $5.7 million in employee incentive compensation expense and (ii) a combined increase in workers' compensation, environmental costs and salaries and benefits of approximately $1.3 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSummary\nThe following table summarizes our liquidity at the dates presented (in millions of dollars):\n\nCash equivalents consist primarily of money market accounts and investments which, when purchased, have a maturity of 90 days or less. We place our cash in bank deposits and money market funds with high credit quality financial institutions, which invest primarily in commercial paper and time deposits of prime quality, short-term repurchase agreements and U.S. government agency notes. Short-term investments represent holdings in investment-grade commercial paper with a maturity of greater than 90 days.\nIn addition to our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents described above, we had restricted cash of $12.9 million at December 31, 2017 that was pledged or held as collateral in connection with workers' compensation requirements and certain other agreements. From time to time, such restricted funds could be returned to us or we could be required to pledge additional cash (see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report).\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries have a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other financial institutions party thereto (\"Revolving Credit Facility\") (see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report). There were no borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for each period presented (in millions of dollars):\n\nOperating Activities\nFabricated Products - In 2017, Fabricated Products segment operating activities provided $221.2 million of cash. Cash provided in 2017 was primarily related to: (i) $201.3 million of operating income; (ii) depreciation and amortization of $39.0 million; (iii) non-cash impairment charges of $19.2 million; (iv) an increase in accounts payable of $11.5 million driven predominantly by the timing of metal purchases and increase in metal price; and (v) an increase in other non-cash items of $6.7 million. Cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by: (i) an increase in accounts receivables of $27.9 million due primarily to the timing of sales and increase in metal price; (ii) unrealized gain on derivative instruments of $19.4 million; (iii) an increase in inventory of $6.3 million; and (iv) an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.6 million.\nIn 2016, Fabricated Products segment operating activities provided $235.6 million of cash. Cash provided in 2016 was primarily related to: (i) $229.6 million of operating income; (ii) adjustments for non-cash items and depreciation and amortization of $21.9 million; (iii) a lower of cost or market inventory write-down of $4.9 million; (iv) a decrease in inventory of $13.1 million; and (v) a net increase in other operating assets and liabilities of $10.3 million. Cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $26.7 million due primarily to the timing of sales and increase in metal price.\nIn 2015, Fabricated Products segment operating activities provided $227.3 million of cash. Cash provided in 2015 was primarily related to: (i) $190.8 million of operating income; (ii) adjustments for non-cash items and depreciation and amortization of $37.5 million; and (iii) a decrease in accounts receivable of $17.0 million, partially offset by: (iv) an increase in inventory of $4.9 million (net of a $2.6 million lower of cost or market charge) due primarily to increased shipment volume; and (v) a decrease in accounts payable of $12.4 million due to the timing of payments and decreasing price of aluminum.\nFor additional information regarding Fabricated Products operating income excluding non-run-rate items, see \"Results of Operations - Segment and Business Unit Information\" above.\nAll Other - Cash outflow from All Other operating activities in 2017 consisted primarily of payments relating to: (i) general and administrative costs of $29.7 million; (ii) an annual variable cash contribution to the VEBAs of $20.0 million with respect to the 2016 year; (iii) our short-term incentive program in the amount of $6.7 million; and (iv) interest on the 5.875% Senior Notes and Revolving Credit Facility of $23.3 million.\nCash outflow from All Other operating activities in 2016 consisted primarily of payments relating to: (i) general and administrative costs of $27.4 million; (ii) an annual variable cash contribution to the VEBAs of $19.5 million with respect to the 2015 year; (iii) our short-term incentive program in the amount of $3.6 million; and (iv) interest on the 5.875% and 8.25% Senior Notes and Revolving Credit Facility of $20.6 million.\nCash outflow from All Other operating activities in 2015 consisted primarily of payments relating to: (i) general and administrative costs of $25.9 million; (ii) an annual variable cash contribution to the VEBAs of $13.7 million with respect to the 2014 year; (iii) our short-term incentive program in the amount of $3.4 million; (iv) interest on the Convertible Notes, 8.25% Senior Notes and Revolving Credit Facility of $22.1 million; and (v) a loss of $2.5 million on the repurchase of our 8.25% Senior Notes.\nInvesting Activities\nFabricated Products - Cash used in investing activities for Fabricated Products was $74.7 million in 2017, compared to $75.8 million of cash used in 2016 and $62.4 million of cash used in 2015. Cash used in 2017 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $75.2 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment of $0.6 million. Cash used in 2016 and 2015 was substantially related to capital expenditures. See \"Capital Expenditures and Investments\" below for additional information.\nAll Other - Cash provided by investing activities during 2017 of $49.2 million primarily consisted of proceeds from the disposition of available for sale securities of $296.9 million, partially offset by purchases of available for sale securities of $247.4 million and capital expenditures of $0.3 million. Cash used in investing activities during 2016 of $200.6 million primarily consisted of $200.1 million net cash outflow in conducting investment activities with respect to our available for sale securities and capital expenditures of $0.5 million. Cash provided by investing activities during 2015 of $82.8 million primarily consisted of proceeds from the disposition of available for sale securities. A portion of the proceeds was used to settle the Convertible Notes on April 1, 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nFabricated Products - Cash used in financing activities was insignificant during 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nAll Other - Cash used in financing activities in 2017 was $119.0 million, representing: (i) $79.5 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program; (ii) $35.0 million of cash dividends paid to stockholders, including the holders of restricted stock, and in dividend equivalents to the holders of certain restricted stock units; and (iii) $4.5 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock to satisfy withholding taxes resulting from the vesting of employee restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2016 was $94.8 million, representing $375.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of our 5.875% Senior Notes and $1.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by: (i) $206.0 million for the redemption of the 8.25% Senior Notes; (ii) $32.4 million of cash dividends paid to our stockholders, including holders of restricted stock, and dividend equivalents paid to holders of certain restricted stock units and to holders of performance shares granted prior to 2014, with respect to the target number of underlying shares of common stock (constituting approximately one-half of the maximum payout); (iii) $33.3 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program; (iv) $6.8 million of debt issuance costs; and (v) $2.9 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock to satisfy withholding taxes resulting from the vesting of employee restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares.\nCash used in financing activities in 2015 was $284.4 million, representing: (i) net cash outlay of $175.0 million to settle the Convertible Notes; (ii) $49.2 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program; (iii) $28.1 million of cash dividends paid to our stockholders, including holders of restricted stock, and dividend equivalents paid to holders of certain restricted stock units and to holders of performance shares granted prior to 2014, with respect to the target number of underlying shares of common stock (constituting approximately one-half of the maximum payout); (iv) a $30.0 million payment related to the repurchase of $27.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.25% Senior Notes; (v) $2.8 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock to satisfy withholding taxes resulting from the vesting of employee restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares; and (vi) $0.6 million of cash paid for financing costs related to the renewal of our Revolving Credit Facility. Cash used in financing activities in 2015 was partially offset by $1.3 million of additional tax benefit in connection with the vesting of employee non-vested shares, restricted stock units and performance shares.\nSources of Liquidity\nWe believe our available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and funds generated from operations are our most significant sources of liquidity. While we believe these sources will be sufficient to finance our working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures and investments, debt service obligations and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months, our ability to fund such cash requirements will depend upon our future operating performance (which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions) and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility matures in December 2020 and provides for borrowings up to $300.0 million (subject to borrowing base limitations), of which up to a maximum of $20.0 million may be utilized for letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility may, subject to certain conditions and the agreement of lenders thereunder, be increased up to $400.0 million.\nThe table below summarizes recent availability and usage of our Revolving Credit Facility (in millions of dollars except for borrowing rate):\n\n_______________________\n 1. Such borrowing rate, if applicable, represents the interest rate for any overnight borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.  We do not believe that covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility are reasonably likely to limit our ability to raise additional debt or equity should we choose to do so during the next 12 months, nor do we believe it is likely that during the next 12 months we will trigger the availability threshold that would require measuring and maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio.\nSee Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for a description of our Revolving Credit Facility.\nDebt\nSee \"Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements - Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\" below for mandatory principal and cash interest payments on the outstanding borrowings under the 5.875% Senior Notes. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further details with respect to the 5.875% Senior Notes and the redemption of our 8.25% Senior Notes.\nWe do not believe that covenants in the indenture governing the 5.875% Senior Notes are reasonably likely to limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing should we choose to do so during the next 12 months.\nCapital Expenditures and Investments\nWe strive to strengthen our competitive position through strategic capital investment. Significant investments over the past decade have positioned us well with increased capacity and expanded manufacturing capabilities while more recent capital projects have focused on further improving product quality and manufacturing cost efficiency, which we believe are critical to maintaining and strengthening our position in an increasingly competitive market environment over the coming decade.\nThe Trentwood efficiency and modernization initiative is a multi-year, $150.0 million capital investment initiative to upgrade equipment throughout the Trentwood process flow to reduce conversion costs, increase efficiency and further improve our competitive cost position on all of Trentwood's products. To differentiate our product quality, the modernization will also replace legacy equipment and improve the process flow for thin gauge plate to achieve KaiserSelect\u00ae quality enhancements for\nboth Aero/HS and GE products. A byproduct of the manufacturing efficiency improvements from upgrades completed during 2017 is incremental manufacturing capacity to enable sales growth in 2018 and beyond. The Trentwood modernization initiative was announced in December 2015 and will span several years. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 40% of the total $150.0 million capital investment remained to be spent.\nTotal capital expenditures were $75.5 million, $76.1 million and $63.1 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A significant portion of our capital spending during 2017 and 2016 was related to the Trentwood modernization project. Additionally, in all three years, we invested to support our automotive growth initiative, including upgrades to existing extrusion presses at several of our automotive-focused facilities, a new extrusion press at our London, Ontario facility in 2015 and a new extrusion press and related equipment at our Sherman, Texas facility in 2015 and 2016. The remainder of our capital spending in all three years was allocated among our manufacturing locations on projects expected to reduce operating costs, improve quality, increase capacity or enhance operational security.\nWe anticipate our capital spending in 2018 will be approximately $80.0 million and include continued spending on the Trentwood modernization and spending at multiple locations for efficiency improvements and operational security. Capital investment will be funded using cash generated from operations, available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or other third-party financing arrangements. The level of anticipated capital expenditures may be adjusted from time to time depending on our business plans, our price outlook for fabricated aluminum products, our ability to maintain adequate liquidity and other factors. No assurance can be provided as to the timing of any such expenditures or the operational benefits expected therefrom.\nDividends\nSee Note 13 and Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding dividends paid during 2017, 2016 and 2015, and declared subsequent to December 31, 2017. See Item 5 of this Report for disclosure regarding the future declaration and payment of dividends.\nRepurchases of Common Stock\nSee Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding repurchases of common stock in 2017 and 2016 and the amounts authorized and available for future repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase program.\nSee Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding minimum statutory tax withholding obligations arising during 2017, 2016 and 2015 in connection with the vesting of non-vested shares, restricted stock units and performance shares.\nRestrictions Related to Equity Capital\nAs discussed elsewhere in this Report, to preserve our ability to fully use our net operating loss carryforwards and other significant tax attributes, we have: (i) adopted a tax asset protection rights plan (\"Tax Asset Rights Plan\"), which is designed to deter transfers of our common stock that could result in an ownership change pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (\"Code\") and (ii) implemented stock transfer restrictions (\"Transfer Restrictions\"), which restrict transfers of our stock by any person who owns, or would become an owner of, 4.99% or more of our stock as determined under Section 382 of the Code. The Tax Asset Rights Plan will expire on April 7, 2019, and the Transfer Restrictions will expire on May 26, 2019.\nEnvironmental Commitments and Contingencies\nSee Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding our environmental commitments and contingencies.\nContractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table and discussion provide a summary of our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2017 (in millions of dollars):\n\nPrincipal and Interest on 5.875% Senior Notes. Cash outlays related to our 5.875% Senior Notes consist of our principal obligations and interest obligations based on scheduled interest payments.\nStandby Letters of Credit. Of the $8.4 million of standby letters of credit, $0.3 million are cash collateralized and $8.1 million represents letters of credit issued under our Revolving Credit Facility. The letters of credit provide financial assurance of our payment of obligations, primarily related to workers' compensation and environmental compliance. The specific timing of payments with respect to such matters is uncertain. The letters of credit generally automatically renew every 12 months and terminate when the underlying obligations no longer require assurance or upon the maturity of our Revolving Credit Facility in September 2020 (for those letters of credit issued under that facility).\nUncertain Tax Liabilities. At December 31, 2017, we had uncertain tax positions which ultimately could result in tax payments. As the amount of ultimate tax payments beyond 2018 is contingent on the tax authorities' assessment, it is not practical to present annual payment information.\nDeferred Compensation Plan Liability. The deferred compensation liability amount relates to our deferred compensation plan for certain key employees. As the distribution amount is contingent upon investment performance, vesting and other eligibility requirements, including retirement dates, it is not practical to present annual payment information.\nCapital Leases. Capital lease spending represents non-cancelable capital commitments as of December 31, 2017. We expect capital leases to be funded through available cash generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and/or other third-party financing arrangements.\nVEBA Obligations. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information regarding our variable cash contributions to the VEBAs.\nPurchase Obligations. Cash outlays for purchase obligations consist primarily of commitments to purchase aluminum, energy and equipment. We have various contracts with suppliers of aluminum that require us to purchase minimum quantities of aluminum in future years at a price to be determined at the time of purchase based primarily on the underlying metal price at that time. Amounts included in the table are based on minimum quantities at the metal price at December 31, 2017. We believe the minimum quantities are lower than our current requirements for aluminum. Actual quantities and actual metal prices at the time of purchase could be different. Physical delivery commitments with energy companies are in place to cover our exposure to fluctuations in electricity and natural gas prices and are based on fixed contractual rates and quantities. Equipment purchase obligations are based on scheduled payments to equipment manufacturers.\nOperating Leases. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain manufacturing facilities, warehouses, office space and equipment.\nCommitment Fees on Revolving Credit Facility. Future commitment fees on our Revolving Credit Facility are estimated based on the amount of unused credit under the facility at December 31, 2017 and assuming no extension of terms beyond the current maturity date of our Revolving Credit Facility, which is in December 2020. No borrowings were outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility either throughout the year or as of December 31, 2017.\nOther Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn addition to our off-balance sheet items discussed in the contractual obligations and commercial commitments section above:\n \u2022 See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding our participation in multi-employer pension plans. \n \u2022 See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding our long-term employee incentive plans. Additional equity awards are expected to be made to employees and non-employee directors in 2018 and future years. \nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.\nIn addition to the accounting estimates we discuss in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report, management believes that the following accounting estimates are critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\n Description Judgments and Uncertainties Potential Effect If Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Self-insured workers' compensation liabilities. We are primarily self-insured for workers' compensation benefits provided to employees. Workers' compensation liabilities are estimated for incurred-but-not-reported claims based on judgment, using our historical claims data and information and analysis provided by actuarial and claim advisors, our insurance carriers and other professionals. We account for accrued liability relating to workers' compensation claims on a discounted basis. ", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (\"MD&A\") is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections:\n \u2022 Management Review of 2017 and Outlook for the Future; \n \u2022 Results of Operations; \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources; \n \u2022 Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements; \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies; and \n \u2022 New Accounting Pronouncements.  Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Report.\nThis information contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the company. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, we have provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure in the accompanying tables. The non-GAAP financial measures used within this presentation are value added revenue, operating income excluding non-run-rate items and ratios related thereto. These measures are presented because management uses this information to monitor and evaluate financial results and trends and believes this information to also be useful for investors.\nIn the discussion of operating results below, we refer to certain items as \"non-run-rate items.\" For purposes of such discussion, non-run-rate items are items that, while they may recur from period-to-period: (i) are particularly material to results; (ii) affect costs primarily as a result of external market factors; and (iii) may not recur in future periods if the same level of underlying performance were to occur. Non-run-rate items are part of our business and operating environment but are worthy of being highlighted for the benefit of readers of our financial statements. Our intent is to allow users of the financial statements to consider our results both in light of and separately from items such as unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses on derivatives related to fluctuations in underlying metal and energy prices and currency exchange rates, lower of cost or market inventory write-downs, non-cash impairments, the impact of discount rate changes on workers' compensation liabilities, legacy environmental expenses related to predecessor operations and gains or losses related to our voluntary employee beneficiary associations (\"VEBAs\"). For a reconciliation of operating income (loss) excluding non-run-rate items to operating income (loss), see \"Results of Operations - Segment and Business Unit Information\" below.\nTo allow users of our financial statements to consider the impact of metal cost on our Net sales, we disclose Net sales as well as \"value added revenue,\" which is Net sales less the Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal. As used in this discussion, \"Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal\" is the cost of our metal inputs at the Midwest Transaction Price of aluminum (\"Midwest Price\") plus the cost of alloying elements and any realized gains and/or losses on settled hedges related to the metal sold in the referenced period. The Midwest Price reflects supply and demand dynamics for primary aluminum in North America. For a reconciliation of value added revenue to Net sales, see \"Results of Operations - Segment and Business Unit Information\" below.\nManagement Review of 2017 and Outlook for the Future\nReview\nFor the full year 2017, we had strong operating performance and achieved record shipments, despite headwinds from aerospace supply chain destocking, lower-than-anticipated automotive build rates, competitive price pressure and construction-related disruptions at our rolling mill in Spokane, Washington (\"Trentwood\").\nGrowth in overall shipments was driven by strong demand for our general engineering and automotive applications that more than offset tempered demand for aerospace applications due to supply chain destocking. Value added revenue declined from the prior year as a result of the leaner mix and the impact of price pressure on higher value added revenue products. Sales margins were compressed on high value added products as competitive price pressure prevented pass through of the increasing contained metal costs. Favorable scrap raw material prices and our initiatives to achieve more efficient raw material utilization partially offset the impact from reduced sales margins.\nDespite the inefficiencies at Trentwood resulting from construction-related project work, overall manufacturing cost efficiency continued to improve as strong performance across our manufacturing platform more than offset Trentwood inefficiencies. Considering the extent of construction-related disruption at Trentwood during the year, our 2017 manufacturing efficiency improvement was a significant accomplishment, particularly given the step-change and record level we achieved in 2016.\nDuring the year, we continued to execute on our capital investment program to further enhance quality and efficiency, expand capacity and sustain strong competitive manufacturing capabilities. Our $75.5 million capital spending in 2017 was primarily focused on modernizing the hot line and light gauge heat treat plate equipment at Trentwood. The 2017 project work around the hot line and thin gauge heat treat plate equipment led to significant construction-related downtime, but will also have a very positive impact on quality, cost and capacity in the future. Additional capital investments will be made as we complete the $150.0 million five-year modernization program.\nIn addition to investments to support further organic growth, during the year we returned $114.5 million of cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Consistent with our capital deployment priorities, we have steadily increased our quarterly dividend over the past seven years, increasing it 11% to $0.50 per share in early 2017 and an additional 10% to $0.55 per share in early 2018.\nGoing forward, we will continue to invest in organic growth and asset integrity initiatives. In addition, we will seek complementary inorganic growth opportunities to create additional value for our shareholders. Furthermore, we will continue to return cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends and disciplined share repurchases.\nOutlook\nAs we look to our aerospace/high strength applications (\"Aero/HS products\"), we expect improving demand in 2018 and 2019 as supply chain destocking runs its course in 2018 and as airframe manufacturers continue to ramp-up build rates to address the large nine-year order backlog. In addition, the new defense budget strengthens the demand for the Joint Strike Fighter program and other military applications. We are very well-positioned in the marketplace and, with supply chain destocking moderating as we proceed through the year, we expect mid-single-digit year-over-year growth in our 2018 shipments for these applications. However, we continue to expect higher contained metal costs and competitive price pressure to continue in 2018.\nFor our automotive extrusion applications (\"Automotive Extrusions\"), North American build rates are expected to improve 1%-2% year-over-year following the 4% decline in builds in 2017. We expect mid-single digit year-over-year growth in 2018 for our automotive shipments and value added revenue.\nWe have generated a 6% compound annual growth rate in both our shipments and value added revenue for general engineering applications (\"GE products\") over the past three years driven by improving, broad-based industrial demand. We are cautiously optimistic about underlying demand for our GE products as we look forward. However, as we have previously discussed, we continue to experience price pressure on our high value-added products from both imports and increasing metal costs.\nOverall for the full year 2018, we anticipate mid-single-digit growth in total shipments and value added revenue compared to 2017. Major maintenance costs in 2018 are expected to be similar to 2017. Capital investment over the next three years, from 2018 through 2020, will remain focused on continued improvement in quality and cost efficiency. Total annual spending is expected to be approximately $80.0 million, with sustaining capital reinvestment expected to be equivalent to approximately 75% of our annual depreciation expense.\nAs we proceed through 2018 and look longer-term, we anticipate improving results driven by growing demand for our Aero/HS products, Automotive Extrusions and GE products and continued improvement in underlying manufacturing cost efficiency.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal 2017 Summary\n \u2022 Our reported operating income for 2017 was $150.7 million, including items that we consider to be non-run-rate, which netted to a charge of $8.4 million. See \"Segment and Business Unit Information\" below for further discussion of our operating income before non-run-rate items. \n \u2022 We recorded incremental income tax expense of $37.2 million due to tax law changes enacted in December 2017, which, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The tax rate reduction required that we reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax assets related to our net operating loss carryforwards and caused the majority of the incremental tax expense. \n \u2022 Our liquidity was approximately $526.7 million as of December 31, 2017, comprised of our cash balances, short-term investments and net borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility (on which there were no outstanding borrowings). \n \u2022 We invested $75.5 million in capital spending for further growth, manufacturing efficiency, quality and operational security. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Expenditures and Investments\" below. \n \u2022 In 2017, we paid $2.9 million to the Salaried VEBA and $17.1 million to the Union VEBA for our cash contributions with respect to 2016. In 2018, we expect to pay another $2.9 million to the Salaried VEBA with respect to 2017 and $12.8 million to the Union VEBA with respect to the nine months ended September 30, 2017. This $12.8 million payment will be our final cash contribution to the Union VEBA. \n \u2022 We paid a total of approximately $35.0 million, or $2.00 per common share, in cash dividends to stockholders, including holders of restricted stock, and dividend equivalents to holders of certain restricted stock units. \n \u2022 We repurchased 938,680 shares of common stock in 2017 for a total cost of $77.8 million pursuant to a stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors.  Consolidated Selected Operational and Financial Information\nThe following data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Report. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further information regarding segments.\nNet Sales. We reported Net sales for 2017 of $1,397.5 million, compared to $1,330.6 million for 2016 and $1,391.9 million for 2015. The increase in Net sales during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily reflected a 2% increase in Fabricated Products segment shipment volume and a 3% increase in average realized sales price per pound. Fabricated Products segment shipment volume increased due primarily to: (i) a 8.1 million pound, or 9%, increase in Automotive Extrusions primarily related to significantly higher bumper shipments and (ii) a 14.8 million pound, or 6%, increase in GE products reflecting the continued solid underlying demand for our general engineering applications, partially offset by a 10.2 million pound, or 4%, decrease in Aero/HS products due to: (i) aerospace supply chain destocking and (ii) temporary plate capacity constraints due to the installation of upgraded equipment and controls at Trentwood. The increase in average realized sales price per pound reflected a 0.12/lb, or 14%, increase in average Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal prices per pound, partially offset by a 0.06/lb, or 5%, decrease in average value added revenue per pound. The decrease in average value added revenue per pound reflected competitive price pressure on spot sales of Aero/HS and GE products and a leaner value added product mix with less volume of Aero/HS products and more volume of Automotive Extrusions and GE products. See the table in \"Segment and Business Unit Information\" below for further details.\nThe decrease in Net sales during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily reflected a 4% decrease in total average realized sales price per pound due to a $0.13/lb, or 13%, decrease in average Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal prices per pound, partially offset by a $0.04/lb, or 3%, increase in average value added revenue per pound. The increase in average value added revenue per pound reflected benefits of pricing improvements on some Aero/HS products and the benefit from lower contained metal prices on some high value added products. Fabricated Products segment shipment volume declined slightly in 2016 compared to 2015 as lower shipments of other industrial products (\"Other products\") were largely offset by an increase in shipments of GE\nproducts. Additionally, Aero/HS products and Automotive Extrusions declined slightly compared to 2015. See the table in \"Segment and Business Unit Information\" below for further details.\nCost of Products Sold, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization and Other Items. Cost of products sold, excluding depreciation and amortization and other items for 2017 totaled $1,105.3 million, or 79% of Net sales, compared to $1,019.5 million, or 77% of Net sales, in 2016 and $1,115.4 million, or 80% of Net sales, in 2015. The increase during 2017 compared to 2016 of $85.8 million was comprised of a $93.6 million increase in Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal, partially offset by a $7.8 million reduction in net manufacturing conversion and other costs. The reduction in net manufacturing conversion and other costs reflected: (i) a $10.9 million favorable impact from efficient raw material usage, primarily due to favorable scrap aluminum pricing and (ii) $1.6 million of lower energy pricing, partially offset by: (i) $3.2 million of higher planned major maintenance expense and (ii) a net $1.5 million manufacturing cost increase as incremental conversion costs associated with higher shipment volume in 2017 were mitigated by favorable manufacturing cost efficiency. Of the $93.6 million increase in Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal, $83.9 million was due to higher hedged metal prices and $9.7 million was due to higher shipment volume, as discussed in \"Net Sales\" above. See \"Segment and Business Unit Information\" below for a further discussion of the comparative results of operations for 2017 and 2016.\nThe decrease during 2016 compared to 2015 of $95.9 million was comprised of a decrease of $84.4 million related to lower Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal and a decrease of $11.5 million in net manufacturing conversion and other costs. Virtually all of the $84.4 million decrease in Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal was due to lower hedged metal prices. The $11.5 million decrease in net manufacturing conversion and other costs reflected: (i) a $14.0 million reduction in controllable manufacturing conversion costs from efficiency improvements; (ii) a $12.6 million reduction in costs resulting from coordinated efforts to increase utilization of recycled scrap aluminum in lieu of more expensive primary aluminum and alloying raw materials; and (iii) a decrease of $2.3 million from lower energy pricing. Offsetting these favorable conversion cost factors were: (i) $7.7 million of incremental costs related to a change in product mix; (ii) a $4.2 million increase in workers' compensation and benefits costs; and (iii) $5.4 million of LIFO and other charges. See \"Segment and Business Unit Information\" below for a further discussion of the comparative results of operations for 2016 and 2015.\nLower of Cost or Market Inventory Write-Down. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information on our inventory lower of cost or market value adjustments.\nUnrealized (Gain) Loss on Derivative Instruments. Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, which is included in Cost of products sold, is primarily due to changes in underlying commodity prices as well as derivative settlements and are related to our operational hedges. These hedges are intended to mitigate our exposure to changes in prices for certain products sold and consumed by us and, to a lesser extent, to mitigate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments was $(19.4) million, $(18.7) million and $3.4 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Unrealized gain in 2017 was comprised of a $20.9 million gain on aluminum hedge positions offset by a $1.4 million loss on natural gas hedge positions and $0.1 million loss on electricity hedge positions. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for details on the unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments for 2016 and 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for 2017 was $39.7 million compared to $36.0 million for 2016 and $32.4 million for 2015. The $3.7 million increase in Depreciation and amortization in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to various construction-in-progress projects being placed in service during 2017 and the second half of 2016 related to capital upgrades at several of our extrusion facilities to support automotive programs that will launch over the next few years and other manufacturing cost efficiency and quality initiatives. Approximately $3.6 million of the increase in Depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to various construction-in-progress projects being placed in service during 2016 and the second half of 2015 related to capital upgrades at several of our extrusion facilities.\nSelling, General, Administrative, Research and Development (\"SG&A and R&D\"). SG&A and R&D expense totaled $97.5 million in 2017 compared to $105.0 million in 2016. The decrease was due primarily to: (i) a $6.2 million decrease in short-term incentive compensation expense based on performance factors and modifiers; (ii) a $2.0 million decrease in salaries and benefits; and (iii) $0.6 million decrease in professional fees and services, partially offset by an increase of $1.3 million in long-term incentive compensation expense.\nSG&A and R&D expense totaled $105.0 million in 2016 compared to $88.1 million in 2015. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to increases of: (i) $9.1 million in our short-term incentive compensation expense; (ii) $2.3 million in our long-term incentive compensation expense; (iii) $1.3 million in professional fees and services; (iv) $1.4 million in management development; and (v) approximately $1.7 million in expenses for workers' compensation, environmental costs and salaries and benefits. The increase in SG&A and R&D was also due to $1.2 million of insurance settlement proceeds we received during 2015.\nNet Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost Relating to Salaried VEBA. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information regarding the Salaried VEBA.\n(Gain) Loss on Removal of Union VEBA Net Assets. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for details on the Loss on removal of Union VEBA net assets in 2015 and our estimated liability for the final remaining variable cash contribution to be paid in 2018.\nGoodwill Impairment. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further details.\nOther Operating Charges, Net. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further details.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense represents cash and non-cash interest expense incurred on our revolving credit facility, our 5.875% senior notes due 2024 (\"5.875% Senior Notes\"), our 8.25% senior notes due 2020 (\"8.25% Senior Notes\"), which were redeemed on June 1, 2016, and our 4.5% cash convertible senior notes due 2015 (\"Convertible Notes\"), which were settled on April 1, 2015, net of capitalized interest. Interest expense was $22.2 million, $20.3 million and $24.1 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, net of $2.2 million, $2.9 million and $1.8 million of interest expense capitalized as part of construction-in-progress, respectively, for the three periods. Non-cash amortization of the discount on the Convertible Notes accounted for $2.4 million of the total interest expense in 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), Net. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for details.\nIncome Tax (Provision) Benefit. The income tax provision for 2017 was $87.6 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 65.9%. The difference between the effective tax rate and the projected blended statutory tax rate for 2017 was primarily due to the passage of H.R.1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). Incremental income tax expense related to the Tax Act included: (i) $29.0 million (or 21.8% of taxable income) related to the write down of deferred tax assets to reflect the new 21% federal corporate tax rate; (ii) $5.9 million (or 4.5% of taxable income) for transition and withholding tax associated with foreign undistributed earnings, including $2.2 million of foreign withholding tax since our earnings in Canada are no longer permanently reinvested; and (iii) $2.3 million (or 1.7% of taxable income) for certain executive compensation that can no longer be deducted under the Tax Act (see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further discussion on the Tax Act).\nThe income tax provision for 2016 was $55.5 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 37.7%. There was no material difference between the effective tax rate and the projected blended statutory tax rate for 2016.\nThe income tax benefit for 2015 was $135.2 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 36.4%. The difference between the effective tax rate and the projected blended statutory tax rate for 2015 was primarily due to: (i) a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of $1.8 million (or 0.5% of taxable income); (ii) state tax rate and apportionment changes in various states resulting in an increase of $4.7 million (or 1.3% of taxable income); and (iii) an increase in the valuation allowance for federal and certain state net operating losses of $2.0 million (or 0.5% of taxable income).\nAs a result of the Tax Act, our long-term effective tax rate is estimated to be in the mid 20% range on a go-forward basis.\nSegment and Business Unit Information\nConsistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker reviews and evaluates our business, we have one operating segment, which we refer to as Fabricated Products, that produces semi-fabricated specialty aluminum products, such as aluminum plate and sheet and extruded and drawn products, for the following end market applications: Aero/HS products, Automotive Extrusions, GE products and Other products.\nWe also have a business unit, All Other, which provides general and administrative support for our operations. For purposes of segment reporting under United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), we treat the Fabricated Products segment as a reportable segment. All Other is not considered a reportable segment.\nThe following data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Report. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further information regarding segments.\nFabricated Products\nThe table below provides selected operational and financial information for our Fabricated Products segment for each period presented (in millions of dollars):\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>201.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact to segment operating income of non-run-rate items:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to plant-level LIFO1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mark-to-market gain (loss) on derivative instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash lower of cost or market inventory write-down2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' compensation benefit (cost) due to discounting\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental expenses4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-run-rate items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income excluding non-run-rate items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>205.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________\n 1. We manage our Fabricated Products segment business on a monthly LIFO basis at each plant, but report inventory externally on an annual LIFO basis in accordance with GAAP on a consolidated basis. This amount represents the conversion from GAAP LIFO applied on a consolidated basis for the Fabricated Products segment to monthly LIFO applied on a plant-by-plant basis. \n 2. The $4.9 million lower of cost or market inventory write-down in 2016 was due primarily to a decrease in our net realizable value of inventory (less a normal profit margin). The $2.6 million lower of cost or market inventory write-down in 2015 was due primarily to declining metal prices. \n 3. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information relating to the impairment of goodwill and one of our customer relationship intangible assets. \n 4. Non-run-rate environmental expenses within Fabricated Products are related to activities that occurred at operating facilities prior to July 6, 2006, while such facilities were occupied by a predecessor. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information relating to the environmental expenses.  As noted above, segment operating income excluding non-run-rate items for 2017 was $13.8 million lower than segment operating income excluding such items for 2016. Lower operating income excluding non-run-rate items reflected: (i) a $20.5 million unfavorable sales impact due primarily to a leaner product mix and compressed sales margins, partially offset by favorable price spreads for scrap raw material purchases; (ii) $3.6 million of higher depreciation and amortization expense; and (iii) $3.2 million of higher planned major maintenance expense, partially offset by: (i) a $4.7 million improvement in net manufacturing conversion and other costs; (ii) a $5.0 million decrease in overhead and other benefits and costs; (iii) a $2.2 million decrease in incentive compensation expense; and (iv) $1.6 million of lower energy pricing.\nSegment operating income excluding non-run-rate items for 2016 was $27.2 million higher than segment operating income excluding such items for 2015. The increase primarily reflected: (i) a $15.3 million favorable sales impact; (ii) a $14.0 million improvement in controllable manufacturing conversion costs; (iii) $12.6 million of favorable impact from coordinated efforts by our metal procurement group and manufacturing operations to increase utilization of recycled scrap aluminum in lieu of more expensive primary aluminum and alloying raw materials; and (iv) a $2.3 million benefit from lower energy prices. These favorable impacts were partially offset by: (i) a $5.3 million increase in incentive compensation expense; (ii) a $3.7 million increase in workers' compensation expense; (iii) a $4.6 million increase in overhead and other benefits and costs; and (iv) $3.5 million of higher depreciation expense. The favorable sales impact reflected expanded sales margins due to price improvements on certain Aero/HS products, as well as lower contained metal prices on certain high value added products.\nThe

Cash used in 2017 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $75.2 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment of $0.6 million. Cash used in 2016 and 2015 was substantially related to capital expenditures. See \"Capital Expenditures and Investments\" below for additional information.\nAll Other - Cash provided by investing activities during 2017 of $49.2 million primarily consisted of proceeds from the disposition of available for sale securities of $296.9 million, partially offset by purchases of available for sale securities of $247.4 million and capital expenditures of $0.3 million. Cash used in investing activities during 2016 of $200.6 million primarily consisted of $200.1 million net cash outflow in conducting investment activities with respect to our available for sale securities and capital expenditures of $0.5 million. Cash provided by investing activities during 2015 of $82.8 million primarily consisted of proceeds from the disposition of available for sale securities. A portion of the proceeds was used to settle the Convertible Notes on April 1, 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nFabricated Products - Cash used in financing activities was insignificant during 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nAll Other - Cash used in financing activities in 2017 was $119.0 million, representing: (i) $79.5 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program; (ii) $35.0 million of cash dividends paid to stockholders, including the holders of restricted stock, and in dividend equivalents to the holders of certain restricted stock units; and (iii) $4.5 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock to satisfy withholding taxes resulting from the vesting of employee restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2016 was $94.8 million, representing $375.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of our 5.875% Senior Notes and $1.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by: (i) $206.0 million for the redemption of the 8.25% Senior Notes; (ii) $32.4 million of cash dividends paid to our stockholders, including holders of restricted stock, and dividend equivalents paid to holders of certain restricted stock units and to holders of performance shares granted prior to 2014, with respect to the target number of underlying shares of common stock (constituting approximately one-half of the maximum payout); (iii) $33.3 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program; (iv) $6.8 million of debt issuance costs; and (v) $2.9 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock to satisfy withholding taxes resulting from the vesting of employee restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares.\nCash used in financing activities in 2015 was $284.4 million, representing: (i) net cash outlay of $175.0 million to settle the Convertible Notes; (ii) $49.2 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program; (iii) $28.1 million of cash dividends paid to our stockholders, including holders of restricted stock, and dividend equivalents paid to holders of certain restricted stock units and to holders of performance shares granted prior to 2014, with respect to the target number of underlying shares of common stock (constituting approximately one-half of the maximum payout); (iv) a $30.0 million payment related to the repurchase of $27.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.25% Senior Notes; (v) $2.8 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock to satisfy withholding taxes resulting from the vesting of employee restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares; and (vi) $0.6 million of cash paid for financing costs related to the renewal of our Revolving Credit Facility. Cash used in financing activities in 2015 was partially offset by $1.3 million of additional tax benefit in connection with the vesting of employee non-vested shares, restricted stock units and performance shares.\nSources of Liquidity\nWe believe our available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and funds generated from operations are our most significant sources of liquidity. While we believe these sources will be sufficient to finance our working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures and investments, debt service obligations and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months, our ability to fund such cash requirements will depend upon our future operating performance (which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions) and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility matures in December 2020 and provides for borrowings up to $300.0 million (subject to borrowing base limitations), of which up to a maximum of $20.0 million may be utilized for letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility may, subject to certain conditions and the agreement of lenders thereunder, be increased up to $400.0 million.\nThe table below summarizes recent availability and usage of our Revolving Credit Facility (in millions of dollars except for borrowing rate):\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>February 15, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving Credit Facility borrowing commitment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowing base availability\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Outstanding borrowings under Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Outstanding letters of credit under Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net remaining borrowing availability\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowing rate (if applicable)1\n</td> <td>4.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________\n 1. Such borrowing rate, if applicable, represents the interest rate for any overnight borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.  We do not believe that covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility are reasonably likely to limit our ability to raise additional debt or equity should we choose to do so during the next 12 months, nor do we believe it is likely that during the next 12 months we will trigger the availability threshold that would require measuring and maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio.\nSee Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for a description of our Revolving Credit Facility.\nDebt\nSee \"Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements - Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\" below for mandatory principal and cash interest payments on the outstanding borrowings under the 5.875% Senior Notes. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further details with respect to the 5.875% Senior Notes and the redemption of our 8.25% Senior Notes.\nWe do not believe that covenants in the indenture governing the 5.875% Senior Notes are reasonably likely to limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing should we choose to do so during the next 12 months.\nCapital Expenditures and Investments\nWe strive to strengthen our competitive position through strategic capital investment. Significant investments over the past decade have positioned us well with increased capacity and expanded manufacturing capabilities while more recent capital projects have focused on further improving product quality and manufacturing cost efficiency, which we believe are critical to maintaining and strengthening our position in an increasingly competitive market environment over the coming decade.\nThe Trentwood efficiency and modernization initiative is a multi-year, $150.0 million capital investment initiative to upgrade equipment throughout the Trentwood process flow to reduce conversion costs, increase efficiency and further improve our competitive cost position on all of Trentwood's products. To differentiate our product quality, the modernization will also replace legacy equipment and improve the process flow for thin gauge plate to achieve KaiserSelect\u00ae quality enhancements for\nboth Aero/HS and GE products. A byproduct of the manufacturing efficiency improvements from upgrades completed during 2017 is incremental manufacturing capacity to enable sales growth in 2018 and beyond. The Trentwood modernization initiative was announced in December 2015 and will span several years. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 40% of the total $150.0 million capital investment remained to be spent.\nTotal capital expenditures were $75.5 million, $76.1 million and $63.1 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A significant portion of our capital spending during 2017 and 2016 was related to the Trentwood modernization project. Additionally, in all three years, we invested to support our automotive growth initiative, including upgrades to existing extrusion presses at several of our automotive-focused facilities, a new extrusion press at our London, Ontario facility in 2015 and a new extrusion press and related equipment at our Sherman, Texas facility in 2015 and 2016. The remainder of our capital spending in all three years was allocated among our manufacturing locations on projects expected to reduce operating costs, improve quality, increase capacity or enhance operational security.\nWe anticipate our capital spending in 2018 will be approximately $80.0 million and include continued spending on the Trentwood modernization and spending at multiple locations for efficiency improvements and operational security. Capital investment will be funded using cash generated from operations, available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or other third-party financing arrangements. The level of anticipated capital expenditures may be adjusted from time to time depending on our business plans, our price outlook for fabricated aluminum products, our ability to maintain adequate liquidity and other factors. No assurance can be provided as to the timing of any such expenditures or the operational benefits expected therefrom.\nDividends\nSee Note 13 and Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding dividends paid during 2017, 2016 and 2015, and declared subsequent to December 31, 2017. See Item 5 of this Report for disclosure regarding the future declaration and payment of dividends.\nRepurchases of Common Stock\nSee Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding repurchases of common stock in 2017 and 2016 and the amounts authorized and available for future repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase program.\nSee Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding minimum statutory tax withholding obligations arising during 2017, 2016 and 2015 in connection with the vesting of non-vested shares, restricted stock units and performance shares.\nRestrictions Related to Equity Capital\nAs discussed elsewhere in this Report, to preserve our ability to fully use our net operating loss carryforwards and other significant tax attributes, we have: (i) adopted a tax asset protection rights plan (\"Tax Asset Rights Plan\"), which is designed to deter transfers of our common stock that could result in an ownership change pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (\"Code\") and (ii) implemented stock transfer restrictions (\"Transfer Restrictions\"), which restrict transfers of our stock by any person who owns, or would become an owner of, 4.99% or more of our stock as determined under Section 382 of the Code. The Tax Asset Rights Plan will expire on April 7, 2019, and the Transfer Restrictions will expire on May 26, 2019.\nEnvironmental Commitments and Contingencies\nSee Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding our environmental commitments and contingencies.\nContractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table and discussion provide a summary of our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December

</tr>\n</table>\nPrincipal and Interest on 5.875% Senior Notes. Cash outlays related to our 5.875% Senior Notes consist of our principal obligations and interest obligations based on scheduled interest payments.\nStandby Letters of Credit. Of the $8.4 million of standby letters of credit, $0.3 million are cash collateralized and $8.1 million represents letters of credit issued under our Revolving Credit Facility. The letters of credit provide financial assurance of our payment of obligations, primarily related to workers' compensation and environmental compliance. The specific timing of payments with respect to such matters is uncertain. The letters of credit generally automatically renew every 12 months and terminate when the underlying obligations no longer require assurance or upon the maturity of our Revolving Credit Facility in September 2020 (for those letters of credit issued under that facility).\nUncertain Tax Liabilities. At December 31, 2017, we had uncertain tax positions which ultimately could result in tax payments. As the amount of ultimate tax payments beyond 2018 is contingent on the tax authorities' assessment, it is not practical to present annual payment information.\nDeferred Compensation Plan Liability. The deferred compensation liability amount relates to our deferred compensation plan for certain key employees. As the distribution amount is contingent upon investment performance, vesting and other eligibility requirements, including retirement dates, it is not practical to present annual payment information.\nCapital Leases. Capital lease spending represents non-cancelable capital commitments as of December 31, 2017. We expect capital leases to be funded through available cash generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and/or other third-party financing arrangements.\nVEBA Obligations. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information regarding our variable cash contributions to the VEBAs.\nPurchase Obligations. Cash outlays for purchase obligations consist primarily of commitments to purchase aluminum, energy and equipment. We have various contracts with suppliers of aluminum that require us to purchase minimum quantities of aluminum in future years at a price to be determined at the time of purchase based primarily on the underlying metal price at that time. Amounts included in the table are based on minimum quantities at the metal price at December 31, 2017. We believe the minimum quantities are lower than our current requirements for aluminum. Actual quantities and actual metal prices at the time of purchase could be different. Physical delivery commitments with energy companies are in place to cover our exposure to fluctuations in electricity and natural gas prices and are based on fixed contractual rates and quantities. Equipment purchase obligations are based on scheduled payments to equipment manufacturers.\nOperating Leases. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain manufacturing facilities, warehouses, office space and equipment.\nCommitment Fees on Revolving Credit Facility. Future commitment fees on our Revolving Credit Facility are estimated based on the amount of unused credit under the facility at December 31, 2017 and assuming no extension of terms beyond the current maturity date of our Revolving Credit Facility, which is in December 2020. No borrowings were outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility either throughout the year or as of December 31, 2017.\nOther Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn addition to our off-balance sheet items discussed in the contractual obligations and commercial commitments section above:\n \u2022 See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding our participation in multi-employer pension plans. \n \u2022 See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding our long-term employee incentive plans. Additional equity awards are expected to be made to employees and non-employee directors in 2018 and future years. \nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.\nIn addition to the accounting estimates we discuss in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report, management believes that the following accounting estimates are critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\n Description Judgments and Uncertainties Potential Effect If Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Self-insured workers' compensation liabilities. We are primarily self-insured for workers' compensation benefits provided to employees. Workers' compensation liabilities are estimated for incurred-but-not-reported claims based on judgment, using our historical claims data and information and analysis provided by actuarial and claim advisors, our insurance carriers and other professionals. We account for accrued liability relating to workers' compensation claims on a discounted basis. "}
