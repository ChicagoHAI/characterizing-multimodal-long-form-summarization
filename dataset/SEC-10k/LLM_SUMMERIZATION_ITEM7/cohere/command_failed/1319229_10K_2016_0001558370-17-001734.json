MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a refined petroleum products terminaling and pipeline transportation company formed in February 2005 as a Delaware limited partnership. We are controlled by our general partner, TransMontaigne GP, which as of February 1, 2016, is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of ArcLight. Prior to February 1, 2016, TransMontaigne LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NGL, owned all of the issued and outstanding ownership interests of TransMontaigne GP. At December 31, 2016, our operations are composed of:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEight refined product terminals located in Florida ( Gulf Coast terminals\u201d), with an aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 6.9 million barrels, that provide integrated terminaling services to NGL, RaceTrac Petroleum Inc., Glencore Ltd., Trafigura, World Fuel Services Corporation, ExxonMobil Oil Corporation, United States Government, Motiva Enterprises LLC, and other distribution and marketing companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA 67-mile interstate refined products pipeline, which we refer to as the Razorback pipeline, that transports gasoline and distillates for customers of Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P. from our two refined product terminals, one located in Mount Vernon, Missouri and the other located in Rogers, Arkansas, which we refer to as our Razorback terminals. These terminals have an aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 421,000 barrels and are leased to Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P. under a ten-year capacity agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOne crude oil terminal located in Cushing, Oklahoma with an aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 1.0 million barrels that provides integrated terminaling services to Castleton Commodities International LLC.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOne refined product terminal located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, with aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 0.2 million barrels, that provides integrated terminaling services to a third party distribution and marketing company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOne refined product terminal located in Brownsville, Texas with aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 0.9 million barrels that provides integrated terminaling services to Nieto Trading, B.V., PMI Trading Ltd. and other distribution and marketing companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA 16-mile LPG pipeline, which we refer to as the Diamondback pipeline, that extends from our Brownsville, Texas facility to the U.S./Mexico border.

The pipeline transports LPG from two points of origin to our terminal in Brownsville: from the King Ranch in Kleberg County, Texas owned and operated by a third party for 121 miles to Brownsville and an additional 11 miles beginning near the King Ranch terminus to the DCP LaGloria Gas Plant in Jim Wells County, Texas.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA 50/50 joint venture with PMI, an indirect subsidiary of PEMEX, for the operation of the Frontera light petroleum products terminal located in Brownsville, Texas with an aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 1.5 million barrels that provides services to PMI Trading Ltd. and other distribution and marketing companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA 42.5%, general voting, Class A Member ownership interest in BOSTCO. BOSTCO is a new fully subscribed, 7.1 million barrel terminal facility on the Houston Ship Channel designed to handle residual fuel, feedstocks, distillates and other black oils. The BOSTCO facility began initial commercial operations in the fourth quarter of 2013. Completion of the approximately 7.1 million barrels of storage capacity and related infrastructure occurred at the end of the third quarter of 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTwelve refined product terminals located along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers ( River terminals\u201d) with aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 2.7 million barrels and the Baton Rouge, Louisiana dock facility that provide integrated terminaling services to Valero Marketing and Supply Company and other distribution and marketing companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTwenty-two refined product terminals located along the Colonial and Plantation pipelines ( Southeast terminals\u201d) with aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 11.0 million barrels that provides integrated terminaling services to NGL, Castleton Commodities International LLC and the United States Government.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe provide integrated terminaling, storage, transportation and related services for customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of light refined petroleum products, heavy refined petroleum products, crude oil, chemicals, fertilizers and other liquid products. Light refined products include gasolines, diesel fuels, heating oil and jet fuels. Heavy refined products include residual fuel oils and asphalt.\nWe do not take ownership of or market products that we handle or transport and, therefore, we are not directly exposed to changes in commodity prices, except for the value of product gains and losses arising from certain of our terminaling services agreements with our customers. The volume of product that is handled, transported through or stored in our terminals and pipelines is directly affected by the level of supply and demand in the wholesale markets served by our terminals and pipelines. Overall supply of refined products in the wholesale markets is influenced by the products' absolute prices, the availability of capacity on delivering pipelines and vessels, fluctuating refinery margins and the markets' perception of future product prices. The demand for gasoline typically peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from April to September, and declines during the fall and winter months. The demand for marine fuels typically peaks in the winter months due to the increase in the number of cruise ships originating from the Florida ports. Despite these seasonalities, the overall impact on the volume of product throughput in our terminals and pipelines is not material.\nOur customer base has diversified over the past couple of years away from affiliates to third party customers. As of December 31, 2016 affiliates are no longer our largest customers and our agreements with them do not provide a substantial amount of our revenue. Our revenue from affiliates represents approximately 5%, 28% and 49%, of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and is primarily earned pursuant to terminaling services agreements. (See Note 2 of Notes to consolidated financial statements).\n\t\t\nSIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE FILING OF OUR PRIOR YEAR FORM 10-K\nChange in control of the ownership of our general partner. Effective February 1, 2016, NGL consummated the sale of its indirect 100% ownership interest in TransMontaigne GP to ArcLight for $350 million in cash. TransMontaigne GP is our general partner and holds a 2% general partner interest and incentive distribution rights. The ArcLight acquisition resulted in a change in control of our partnership. The February 1, 2016 ArcLight acquisition did not involve any of our limited partnership units held by the public, and our limited partnership units continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, on April 1, 2016, affiliates of ArcLight acquired approximately 3.2 million of our common LP units from NGL. With the purchase of the common units, ArcLight has a significant interest in our partnership through their ownership of the general partner interest, the incentive distribution rights and approximately 20% of the limited partner interests.\nArcLight is one of the leading private equity firms focused on North American and Western European energy assets. Since its establishment in 2001, ArcLight has invested over $17 billion across multiple energy cycles in more than 100 investments. Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts with an additional office in Luxembourg, the firm's investment team brings extensive energy expertise, industry relationships and specialized value creation capabilities to our operations.\nUpon the closing of the ArcLight acquisition, Atanas H. Atanasov, Benjamin Borgen, Brian Cannon and Donald M. Jensen, each employees of NGL, resigned from the board of directors of our general partner. To fill the vacancies resulting from the resignation of the NGL directors, Daniel R. Revers, Kevin M. Crosby and Lucius H. Taylor, each employees of ArcLight, were appointed to the board of directors of our general partner effective February 1, 2016. On February 22, 2016, Theodore D. Burke, an employee of ArcLight, was appointed to the board of directors of our general partner. On July 19, 2016, Robert A. Burk and Lawrence C. Ross notified the partnership of their intention to resign from the board of directors of our general partner and the audit, compensation and conflicts committees thereof, effective July 21, 2016. On July 21, 2016 the board of directors of our general partner appointed Jay A. Wiese and Barry E. Welch to serve as independent members of the board of directors of our general partner. Mr. Wiese was elected to serve as the chairman of the compensation committee of our general partner and as a member of the audit and conflicts committees. Mr. Welch was elected to serve as the chairman of the conflicts committee of our general partner and as a member of the audit and compensation committees.\nIn connection with the ArcLight acquisition, our Southeast terminaling services agreement with NGL was amended to extend the term of the agreement through July 31, 2040 at the prevailing contract rate terms contained within the agreement. Subsequent to January 31, 2023, NGL has the ability to terminate the agreement at any time upon at least 24 months' prior notice of its intent to terminate the agreement. In addition, we also entered into a second amended and restated omnibus agreement to assign it from TransMontaigne LLC to ArcLight and remove certain legacy provisions that were no longer applicable to our partnership. Under the second amended and restated omnibus agreement, we pay ArcLight (and prior to the ArcLight acquisition, we paid TransMontaigne LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NGL) an administrative fee for the provision of certain management, legal, accounting, tax, corporate staff, engineering and other support services. The second amended and restated omnibus agreement will continue in effect until the earlier to occur of (i) ArcLight ceasing to control our general partner or (ii) the election of us or ArcLight, following at least 24 months' prior written notice to the other party of the intent to terminate the agreement. The amendment did not change the financial terms, substantive rights or obligations of the parties under the omnibus agreement.\nExpansion of the Collins/Purvis bulk storage terminal. We previously entered into long-term terminaling services agreements with various parties for approximately 2.0 million barrels of new storage capacity at our Collins/Purvis, Mississippi bulk storage terminal. The revenue associated with these agreements will come on-line upon completion of the construction of the new tank capacity. In December 2016, we placed into service 0.9 million barrels of the 2.0 million barrels of new tank capacity, and in February 2017 we placed into service an additional 0.3 million barrels. Completion of the remaining 0.8 million barrels of new tank capacity will occur in various stages through the second quarter of 2017. The anticipated aggregate cost of the 2.0 million barrels of new capacity is approximately $75 million. Construction of the Collins/Purvis expansion project commenced in the first quarter of 2016, and we have spent approximately $46 million as of February 28, 2017. Our Collins/Purvis terminal is strategically located for the bulk storage market and is the only independent terminal capable of receiving from, delivering to, and transferring refined\n\t\t\npetroleum products between the Colonial and Plantation pipeline systems. Our facility has current active storage capacity of approximately 4.6 million barrels and is expected to increase to approximately 5.4 million barrels once the remaining 0.8 million barrels of tankage is completed. We have also begun the process of permitting an additional 5.0 million barrels of capacity for future construction at our Collins/Purvis terminal and are in active discussions with several potential customers regarding this potential future capacity.\nCommercial re-contracting activity. Effective January 1, 2016, we re-contracted for an additional five years 2.7 million barrels of existing product storage capacity at our Collins/Purvis, Mississippi bulk storage terminals to an existing third-party customer. The new agreement contains an increase to the minimum throughput payments and is anticipated to generate additional minimum throughput revenue of $4.6 million annually.\nEffective July 1, 2016, we re-contracted for an additional five years a significant portion of our River terminals' capacity to an existing third-party customer. The new agreement is for similar capacity, contains higher rates and is anticipated to generate additional minimum throughput revenue in excess of $1.6 million annually.\nDuring June and July 2016, we contracted approximately 500,000 barrels of available capacity at our Port Manatee, Florida terminal to various third-party customers for terms that range between eight months to two years. The majority of this capacity had been uncontracted since May 2014, with the remaining capacity uncontracted since October 2015. With the addition of these new agreements, approximately 100% of our Gulf Coast terminals are now under contract with third-party customers.\nQuarterly distributions. On January 16, 2017, we announced a distribution of $0.71 per unit for the period from October 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. This distribution was paid on February 8, 2017 to unitholders of record on January 31, 2017. On October 17, 2016, we announced a distribution of $0.70 per unit for the period from July 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016. This distribution was paid on November 7, 2016 to unitholders of record on October 31, 2016. On July 18, 2016, we announced a distribution of $0.69 per unit for the period from April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016. This distribution was paid on August 8, 2016 to unitholders of record on July 29, 2016. On April 18, 2016, we announced a distribution of $0.68 per unit for the period from January 1, 2016 through March 31, 2016. This distribution was paid on May 9, 2016 to unitholders of record on April 29, 2016.\nCredit facility upsize and extension. On March 13 2017, we amended and restated our credit facility to extend the maturity date to March 31, 2022 and increase the maximum borrowing line of credit from $400 million to $600 million, and allow for up to $175 million in additional future permitted JV investments\u201d, which may include additional investments in BOSTCO. The amendment allows for, at our request, the maximum borrowing line of credit to be increased by an additional $250 million, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the receipt of additional commitments from one or more lenders.\nWe may elect to have loans under the credit facility bear interest either (i) at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin, or (ii) at the base rate plus a margin. The amendment decreased the rate of LIBOR plus a margin from a range of 2% to 3% to 1.75% to 2.75% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect and decreased the base rate plus a margin from 1% to 2% to 0.75% to 1.75% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect.\nNATURE OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES\nWe derive revenue from our terminal and pipeline transportation operations by charging fees for providing integrated terminaling, transportation and related services. The fees we charge, our other sources of revenue and our direct costs and expenses are described below.\nTerminaling services fees. We generate terminaling services fees by distributing and storing products for our customers. Terminaling services fees include throughput fees based on the volume of product distributed from the facility, injection fees based on the volume of product injected with additive compounds and storage fees based on a rate per barrel of storage capacity per month.\n\t\t\nPipeline transportation fees. We earn pipeline transportation fees at our Diamondback and Ella-Brownsville pipelines based on the volume of product transported and the distance from the origin point to the delivery point. We earn pipeline transportation fees at our Razorback pipeline based on an allocation of the aggregate fees charged under the capacity agreement with our customer who has contracted for 100% of our Razorback system. We own the Razorback and Diamondback pipelines, and we lease the Ella-Brownsville pipeline from a third party. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates the tariff on our pipelines.\nManagement fees and reimbursed costs. We manage and operate for a major oil company certain tank capacity at our Port Everglades South, Florida terminal and receive reimbursement of their proportionate share of operating and maintenance costs. We manage and operate for an affiliate of Mexico's state-owned petroleum company a bi-directional products pipeline connected to our Brownsville, Texas terminal facility and receive a management fee and reimbursement of costs. We manage and operate the Frontera terminal facility located in Brownsville, Texas for a management fee based on our costs incurred. Frontera is an unconsolidated affiliate for which we have a 50% ownership interest.\nOther revenue. We provide ancillary services including heating and mixing of stored products, product transfer, railcar handling, butane blending, wharfage and vapor recovery. Pursuant to terminaling services agreements with certain throughput customers, we are entitled to the volume of product gained resulting from differences in the measurement of product volumes received and distributed at our terminaling facilities. Consistent with recognized industry practices, measurement differentials occur as the result of the inherent variances in measurement devices and methodology. We recognize as revenue the net proceeds from the sale of the product gained.\nDirect operating costs and expenses. The direct operating costs and expenses of our operations include the directly related wages and employee benefits, utilities, communications, maintenance and repairs, property taxes, rent, vehicle expenses, environmental compliance costs, materials and supplies needed to operate our terminals and pipelines.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. The general and administrative expenses of our operations include an administrative fee paid to the owner of TransMontaigne GP for indirect corporate overhead to cover costs of centralized corporate functions such as legal, accounting, treasury, insurance administration and claims processing, health, safety and environmental, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, taxes, engineering and other corporate services. General and administrative expenses also include direct general and administrative expenses for third party accounting costs associated with annual and quarterly reports and tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, legal fees, independent director fees and equity-based compensation expense under the long-term incentive plan.\nInsurance expenses. Insurance expenses include charges for insurance premiums to cover costs of insuring activities such as property, casualty, pollution, automobile, directors' and officers' liability, and other insurable risks.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nA summary of the significant accounting policies that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our historical consolidated financial statements is detailed in Note 1 of Notes to consolidated financial statements. Certain of these accounting policies require the use of estimates. The following estimates, in management's opinion, are subjective in nature, require the exercise of judgment and involve complex analyses: useful lives of our plant and equipment and accrued environmental obligations. These estimates are based on our knowledge and understanding of current conditions and actions we may take in the future. Changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events. Subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nUseful lives of plant and equipment. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method, based on estimated useful lives of our assets. These estimates are based on various factors including age (in the case of acquired assets), manufacturing specifications, technological advances and historical data concerning useful lives of similar assets. Uncertainties that impact these estimates include changes in laws and regulations relating to restoration, economic conditions and supply and demand in the area. When assets are put into service, we make estimates with\n\t\t\nrespect to useful lives that we believe to be reasonable. However, subsequent events could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation. Estimated useful lives are 15 to 25 years for terminals and pipelines and 3 to 25 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment.\nAccrued environmental obligations. At December 31, 2016, we have an accrued liability of approximately $2.1 million representing our best estimate of the undiscounted future payments we expect to pay for environmental costs to remediate existing conditions. Estimates of our environmental obligations are subject to change due to a number of factors and judgments involved in the estimation process, including the early stage of investigation at certain sites, the lengthy time frames required to complete remediation, technology changes affecting remediation methods, alternative remediation methods and strategies and changes in environmental laws and regulations. Changes in our estimates and assumptions may occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events.\nCosts incurred to remediate existing contamination at the terminals we acquired from TransMontaigne LLC have been, and are expected in the future to be, insignificant. Pursuant to agreements with TransMontaigne LLC, TransMontaigne LLC retained 100% of these liabilities and indemnified us against certain potential environmental claims, losses and expenses associated with the operation of the acquired terminal facilities and occurring before our date of acquisition from TransMontaigne LLC, up to a maximum liability for these indemnification obligations (not to exceed $15.0 million for the Florida and Midwest terminals acquired on May 27, 2005, not to exceed $15.0 million for the Brownsville and River facilities acquired on December 31, 2006, not to exceed $15.0 million for the Southeast terminals acquired on December 31, 2007 and not to exceed $2.5 million for the Pensacola terminal acquired on March 1, 2011). The forgoing environmental indemnification obligations of TransMontaigne LLC to us remain in place and were not affected by the ArcLight acquisition.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS-YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014\nANALYSIS OF REVENUE\nTotal revenue.

Pursuant to terminaling services agreements with our customers, which range from one month to several years in duration, we generate fees by distributing and storing products for our customers. Terminaling services fees include throughput fees based on the volume of product distributed from the facility, injection fees based on the volume of product injected with additive compounds and storage fees based on a rate per barrel of storage capacity per month. The terminaling services fees by business segments were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTerminaling Services Fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nby Business Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGulf Coast terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n45,903 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n42,049 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n43,777 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMidwest terminals and pipeline system\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,590 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,330 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,164 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBrownsville terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,234 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,037 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,280 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRiver terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,664 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,316 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,566 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSoutheast terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n53,699 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,503 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45,070 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTerminaling services fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n126,090 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n114,235 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n111,857 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in terminaling services fees at our Gulf Coast terminals for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an increase of approximately $1.4 million resulting from the majority of the light oil tankage at our Port Manatee, Florida terminal being offline for approximately four months during the year ended December 31, 2015 in order to complete enhancements for a new customer at this facility. The enhanced tankage at Port Manatee became available to the third party customer in July of 2015. The increase in terminaling services fees at our Gulf Coast terminals also includes an increase of approximately $1.1 million resulting from the acquisition of the Port Everglades, Florida hydrant system on January 28, 2016 and an increase of approximately $0.8 million due to re-contracting our bunker fuel capacity at Port Manatee, vacant since May 31, 2014, to third party customers. The decrease in terminaling services fees at our Gulf Coast terminals for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 includes a decrease of approximately $1.1 million, resulting from an affiliate terminating its bunker fuels agreement at our Fisher Island, Cape Canaveral and Port Manatee, Florida terminals effective December 31, 2013, May 31, 2014 and May 31, 2014, respectively. Towards the end of 2014 and beginning in 2015, we were able to re-contract the bunker fuel capacity at our Cape Canaveral and Fisher Island terminals to third parties at similar rates to the preceding agreements. We re-contracted our bunker fuel capacity at Port Manatee on June 4, 2016 and July 16, 2016.\n\t\t\nThe increase in terminaling services fees at our Brownsville terminals for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 includes an increase of approximately $1.2 million due to additional LPG throughput resulting from the King Ranch gas plant becoming operational again in late November 2014. The plant, which was owned and operated by a third party, had been shut down since November 2013 due to a fire. The impact of the King Ranch gas plant fire is further discussed below in pipeline transportation fees. The increase in terminaling services fees at our Brownsville terminals also includes an increase of approximately $0.6 million resulting from us contracting 110,000 barrels of available capacity to a third party for a three year term commencing in May of 2015. The majority of this capacity had been vacant since the first quarter of 2014.\nThe increase in terminaling services fees at our Southeast terminals for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an increase of approximately $4.6 million resulting from us entering into a new five year agreement with a third party customer for approximately 2.7 million barrels of existing capacity at our Collins/Purvis, Mississippi bulk storage terminal, commencing January 1, 2016. The new agreement replaced the previous agreement we had with the third party customer for this tankage and contains an increase to the minimum throughput fees. The increase in terminaling services fees at our Southeast terminals also includes an increase of approximately $1.3 million from us entering into a new five year agreement with a third party customer for approximately 1.2 million barrels of existing and new capacity at our Collins/Purvis, Mississippi bulk storage terminal, commencing January 1, 2016. The majority of the approximately 1.2 million barrels of capacity represents new construction placed into service in December 2016.\nIncluded in terminaling services fees for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are fees charged to affiliates of approximately $3.1 million, $34.8 million and $59.0 million, respectively.\nOur terminaling services agreements are structured as either throughput agreements or storage agreements. Most of our throughput agreements contain provisions that require our customers to throughput a minimum volume of product at our facilities over a stipulated period of time, which results in a fixed amount of revenue to be recognized by us. Our storage agreements require our customers to make minimum payments based on the volume of storage capacity available to the customer under the agreement, which results in a fixed amount of revenue to be recognized by us. We refer to the fixed amount of revenue recognized pursuant to our terminaling services agreements as being firm commitments.\u201d Revenue recognized in excess of firm commitments and revenue recognized based solely on the volume of product distributed or injected are referred to as variable.\u201d The firm commitments\u201d and variable\u201d revenue included in terminaling services fees were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFirm Commitments and Variable Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFirm commitments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExternal customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n113,484 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n75,218 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n49,024 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAffiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,857 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31,856 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,226 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n116,341 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n107,074 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n107,250 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVariable:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExternal customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,486 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,169 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,789 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAffiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,992 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,749 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,161 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,607 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTerminaling services fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n126,090 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n114,235 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n111,857 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\nThe remaining terms on the terminaling services agreements that generated firm commitments\u201d for the year ended December 31, 2016 were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess than 1 year remaining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,875 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n1 year or more, but less than 3 years remaining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40,852 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n3 years or more, but less than 5 years remaining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32,187 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n5 years or more remaining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34,427 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal firm commitments for the year ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n116,341 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPipeline transportation fees.

TransMontainge GP for indirect corporate overhead to cover costs of centralized corporate functions such as legal, accounting, treasury, insurance administration and claims processing, health, safety and environmental, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, taxes, engineering and other corporate services. The administrative fee paid to the owner of TransMontainge GP for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $11.4 million, $11.3 million and $11.1 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses also include direct general and administrative expenses for third party accounting costs associated with annual and quarterly reports and tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, legal fees, independent director fees and equity-based compensation expense under the long-term incentive plan. The direct general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $3.4 million, $3.6 million and $3.5 million, respectively.\nInsurance expenses include charges for insurance premiums to cover costs of insuring activities such as property, casualty, pollution, automobile, directors' and officers' liability, and other insurable risks. Prior to October 31, 2016, we paid the owner of TransMontainge GP for insurance policies purchased on our behalf to cover our facilities and operations. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the insurance expense paid to the owner of TransMontaigne GP was approximately $3.1 million, $3.8 million and $3.7 million, respectively. On October 31, 2016, we contracted directly with insurance carriers for the majority of our insurance requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the expense associated with insurance contracted directly by us was $1.0 million, $nil and $nil, respectively.\nReimbursement of bonus awards includes expense associated with us reimbursing an affiliate of TransMontaigne GP for awards granted by them to certain key officers and employees who provide service to us that vest over future service periods. We have the intent and ability to settle our reimbursement for the bonus awards by issuing additional common units, and accordingly, we account for the bonus awards as an equity award. The expenses associated with these reimbursements were approximately $2.5 million, $1.3 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in reimbursement of bonus awards expense is primarily attributable to a portion of the 2015 grants vesting upon the change in control of our general partner as a result of the ArcLight acquisition, effective February 1, 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $32.4 million, $30.7 million and $29.5 million, respectively.\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $7.8 million, $7.4 million and $5.5 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to us no longer capitalizing interest on our investment in BOSTCO, as it was placed into service throughout the first three quarters of 2014.\n\t\t\nANALYSIS OF INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES\nAt December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our investments in unconsolidated affiliates include a 42.5% Class A ownership interest in BOSTCO and a 50% ownership interest in Frontera.

We expect to initially fund any investments, capital projects and future expansion, development and acquisition opportunities with undistributed cash flows from operations and additional borrowings under our credit facility. After initially funding expenditures with borrowings under our credit facility, we may raise funds through additional equity offerings and debt financings. The proceeds of such equity offerings and debt financings may then be used to reduce our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility.\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n79,107 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n87,480 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n60,929 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(69,089) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(34,153) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(50,702) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(10,106) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(55,950) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(10,186) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in net cash provided by operating activities includes a decrease in distributions received from our investment in BOSTCO, which is primarily attributable to a one-time gain resulting from a contract buy-out by one of the BOSTCO customers in April of 2015. Our share of the gain in the prior year was approximately $3.4 million, which we received in cash as a component of our third quarter 2015 distribution from BOSTCO. The change in net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by the timing of working capital requirements and increased net margins.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities includes an increase of $12.0 million for the acquisition of the Port Everglades, Florida hydrant system and an increase of approximately $25.4 million in capital expenditures, primarily related to the construction of approximately 2.0 million barrels of new storage capacity at our Collins/Purvis, Mississippi bulk storage terminal. Management and the board of directors of our general partner have approved additional investments and expansion capital projects at our terminals that currently are, or will be, under construction with estimated completion dates that extend through the first quarter of 2018. At December 31, 2016, the remaining expenditures to complete the approved projects are estimated to be approximately $40 million, which primarily relates to the remaining construction costs associated with the approximately 2.0 million barrels of new storage capacity at our Collins/Purvis bulk storage terminal.\nThe decrease in net cash used in financing activities includes an increase of $47.8 million in net borrowings under our credit facility to help fund the increase in investing activities.\nThird amended and restated senior secured credit facility. On March 13, 2017, we entered into the third amended and restated senior secured credit facility, or the credit facility\u201d, that provides for a maximum borrowing line of credit equal to $600 million. At our request, the maximum borrowing line of credit may be increased by an additional $250 million, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the receipt of additional commitments from one or more lenders. The terms of the credit facility include covenants that restrict our ability to make cash distributions, acquisitions and investments, including investments in joint ventures. We may make distributions of cash to the extent of our available cash\u201d as defined in our partnership agreement. We may make acquisitions and investments that meet the definition of permitted acquisitions\u201d; other investments\u201d which may not exceed 5% of consolidated net tangible assets\u201d; and additional future permitted JV investments\u201d up to $175 million, which may include additional investments in BOSTCO. The principal balance of loans and any accrued and unpaid interest are due and payable in full on the maturity date, March 31, 2022.\nWe may elect to have loans under the credit facility bear interest either (i) at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.75% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect, or (ii) at the base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.75% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect. We also pay a commitment fee on the\n\t\t\nunused amount of commitments, ranging from 0.375% to 0.5% per annum, depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect. Our obligations under the credit facility are secured by a first priority security interest in favor of the lenders in the majority of our assets, including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates. At December 31, 2016, our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility were $291.8 million.\nThe credit facility also contains customary representations and warranties (including those relating to organization and authorization, compliance with laws, absence of defaults, material agreements and litigation) and customary events of default (including those relating to monetary defaults, covenant defaults, cross defaults and bankruptcy events). The primary financial covenants contained in the credit facility are (i) a total leverage ratio test (not to exceed 4.75 times), (ii) a senior secured leverage ratio test (not to exceed 3.75 times) in the event we issue senior unsecured notes, and (iii) a minimum interest coverage ratio test (not less than 3.0 times). These financial covenants are based on a non-GAAP, defined financial performance measure within the credit facility known as Consolidated EBITDA.\u201d The calculation of the total leverage ratio\u201d and interest coverage ratio\u201d contained in the credit facility is as follows (in thousands, except ratios):\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

On September 2, 2016, the SEC declared effective a universal shelf registration statement, which replaced our prior shelf registration statement that previously expired. As with the prior shelf registration statement, the new shelf registration statement allows us to issue common units and debt securities. In connection with the shelf registration statement, we established a common unit offering program under which we may issue and sell common units from time to time, representing limited partner interests, up to an aggregate gross sales amount of $50 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from any equity sales pursuant to the common unit offering program, after deducting the agent's commissions and the partnership's offering expenses, for general partnership purposes, which may include, among other things, repayment of indebtedness, capital expenditures, working capital or\n\t\t\nacquisitions. To date we have issued no common units or debt securities under the common unit offering program or the registration statement.\nContractual obligations and contingencies.

"item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a refined petroleum products terminaling and pipeline transportation company formed in February 2005 as a Delaware limited partnership. We are controlled by our general partner, TransMontaigne GP, which as of February 1, 2016, is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of ArcLight. Prior to February 1, 2016, TransMontaigne LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NGL, owned all of the issued and outstanding ownership interests of TransMontaigne GP. At December 31, 2016, our operations are composed of:\n \u00b7 Eight refined product terminals located in Florida ( Gulf Coast terminals\u201d), with an aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 6.9 million barrels, that provide integrated terminaling services to NGL, RaceTrac Petroleum Inc., Glencore Ltd., Trafigura, World Fuel Services Corporation, ExxonMobil Oil Corporation, United States Government, Motiva Enterprises LLC, and other distribution and marketing companies. \n \u00b7 A 67-mile interstate refined products pipeline, which we refer to as the Razorback pipeline, that transports gasoline and distillates for customers of Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P. from our two refined product terminals, one located in Mount Vernon, Missouri and the other located in Rogers, Arkansas, which we refer to as our Razorback terminals. These terminals have an aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 421,000 barrels and are leased to Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P. under a ten-year capacity agreement. \n \u00b7 One crude oil terminal located in Cushing, Oklahoma with an aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 1.0 million barrels that provides integrated terminaling services to Castleton Commodities International LLC. \n \u00b7 One refined product terminal located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, with aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 0.2 million barrels, that provides integrated terminaling services to a third party distribution and marketing company. \n \u00b7 One refined product terminal located in Brownsville, Texas with aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 0.9 million barrels that provides integrated terminaling services to Nieto Trading, B.V., PMI Trading Ltd. and other distribution and marketing companies. \n \u00b7 A 16-mile LPG pipeline, which we refer to as the Diamondback pipeline, that extends from our Brownsville, Texas facility to the U.S./Mexico border. At the U.S border the Diamondback pipeline connects to a pipeline and storage terminal in Matamoros, Mexico, owned by Nieto Trading, B.V. \n\t\t\n \u00b7 A pipeline leased from the Seadrift Pipeline Corporation, which we refer to as the Ella-Brownsville pipeline. The pipeline transports LPG from two points of origin to our terminal in Brownsville: from the King Ranch in Kleberg County, Texas owned and operated by a third party for 121 miles to Brownsville and an additional 11 miles beginning near the King Ranch terminus to the DCP LaGloria Gas Plant in Jim Wells County, Texas. \n \u00b7 A 50/50 joint venture with PMI, an indirect subsidiary of PEMEX, for the operation of the Frontera light petroleum products terminal located in Brownsville, Texas with an aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 1.5 million barrels that provides services to PMI Trading Ltd. and other distribution and marketing companies. \n \u00b7 A 42.5%, general voting, Class A Member ownership interest in BOSTCO. BOSTCO is a new fully subscribed, 7.1 million barrel terminal facility on the Houston Ship Channel designed to handle residual fuel, feedstocks, distillates and other black oils. The BOSTCO facility began initial commercial operations in the fourth quarter of 2013. Completion of the approximately 7.1 million barrels of storage capacity and related infrastructure occurred at the end of the third quarter of 2014. \n \u00b7 Twelve refined product terminals located along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers ( River terminals\u201d) with aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 2.7 million barrels and the Baton Rouge, Louisiana dock facility that provide integrated terminaling services to Valero Marketing and Supply Company and other distribution and marketing companies. \n \u00b7 Twenty-two refined product terminals located along the Colonial and Plantation pipelines ( Southeast terminals\u201d) with aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 11.0 million barrels that provides integrated terminaling services to NGL, Castleton Commodities International LLC and the United States Government. \nWe provide integrated terminaling, storage, transportation and related services for customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of light refined petroleum products, heavy refined petroleum products, crude oil, chemicals, fertilizers and other liquid products. Light refined products include gasolines, diesel fuels, heating oil and jet fuels. Heavy refined products include residual fuel oils and asphalt.\nWe do not take ownership of or market products that we handle or transport and, therefore, we are not directly exposed to changes in commodity prices, except for the value of product gains and losses arising from certain of our terminaling services agreements with our customers. The volume of product that is handled, transported through or stored in our terminals and pipelines is directly affected by the level of supply and demand in the wholesale markets served by our terminals and pipelines. Overall supply of refined products in the wholesale markets is influenced by the products' absolute prices, the availability of capacity on delivering pipelines and vessels, fluctuating refinery margins and the markets' perception of future product prices. The demand for gasoline typically peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from April to September, and declines during the fall and winter months. The demand for marine fuels typically peaks in the winter months due to the increase in the number of cruise ships originating from the Florida ports. Despite these seasonalities, the overall impact on the volume of product throughput in our terminals and pipelines is not material.\nOur customer base has diversified over the past couple of years away from affiliates to third party customers. As of December 31, 2016 affiliates are no longer our largest customers and our agreements with them do not provide a substantial amount of our revenue. Our revenue from affiliates represents approximately 5%, 28% and 49%, of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and is primarily earned pursuant to terminaling services agreements. (See Note 2 of Notes to consolidated financial statements).\n\t\t\nSIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE FILING OF OUR PRIOR YEAR FORM 10-K\nChange in control of the ownership of our general partner. Effective February 1, 2016, NGL consummated the sale of its indirect 100% ownership interest in TransMontaigne GP to ArcLight for $350 million in cash. TransMontaigne GP is our general partner and holds a 2% general partner interest and incentive distribution rights. The ArcLight acquisition resulted in a change in control of our partnership. The February 1, 2016 ArcLight acquisition did not involve any of our limited partnership units held by the public, and our limited partnership units continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, on April 1, 2016, affiliates of ArcLight acquired approximately 3.2 million of our common LP units from NGL. With the purchase of the common units, ArcLight has a significant interest in our partnership through their ownership of the general partner interest, the incentive distribution rights and approximately 20% of the limited partner interests.\nArcLight is one of the leading private equity firms focused on North American and Western European energy assets. Since its establishment in 2001, ArcLight has invested over $17 billion across multiple energy cycles in more than 100 investments. Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts with an additional office in Luxembourg, the firm's investment team brings extensive energy expertise, industry relationships and specialized value creation capabilities to our operations.\nUpon the closing of the ArcLight acquisition, Atanas H. Atanasov, Benjamin Borgen, Brian Cannon and Donald M. Jensen, each employees of NGL, resigned from the board of directors of our general partner. To fill the vacancies resulting from the resignation of the NGL directors, Daniel R. Revers, Kevin M. Crosby and Lucius H. Taylor, each employees of ArcLight, were appointed to the board of directors of our general partner effective February 1, 2016. On February 22, 2016, Theodore D. Burke, an employee of ArcLight, was appointed to the board of directors of our general partner. On July 19, 2016, Robert A. Burk and Lawrence C. Ross notified the partnership of their intention to resign from the board of directors of our general partner and the audit, compensation and conflicts committees thereof, effective July 21, 2016. On July 21, 2016 the board of directors of our general partner appointed Jay A. Wiese and Barry E. Welch to serve as independent members of the board of directors of our general partner. Mr. Wiese was elected to serve as the chairman of the compensation committee of our general partner and as a member of the audit and conflicts committees. Mr. Welch was elected to serve as the chairman of the conflicts committee of our general partner and as a member of the audit and compensation committees.\nIn connection with the ArcLight acquisition, our Southeast terminaling services agreement with NGL was amended to extend the term of the agreement through July 31, 2040 at the prevailing contract rate terms contained within the agreement. Subsequent to January 31, 2023, NGL has the ability to terminate the agreement at any time upon at least 24 months' prior notice of its intent to terminate the agreement. In addition, we also entered into a second amended and restated omnibus agreement to assign it from TransMontaigne LLC to ArcLight and remove certain legacy provisions that were no longer applicable to our partnership. Under the second amended and restated omnibus agreement, we pay ArcLight (and prior to the ArcLight acquisition, we paid TransMontaigne LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NGL) an administrative fee for the provision of certain management, legal, accounting, tax, corporate staff, engineering and other support services. The second amended and restated omnibus agreement will continue in effect until the earlier to occur of (i) ArcLight ceasing to control our general partner or (ii) the election of us or ArcLight, following at least 24 months' prior written notice to the other party of the intent to terminate the agreement. The amendment did not change the financial terms, substantive rights or obligations of the parties under the omnibus agreement.\nExpansion of the Collins/Purvis bulk storage terminal. We previously entered into long-term terminaling services agreements with various parties for approximately 2.0 million barrels of new storage capacity at our Collins/Purvis, Mississippi bulk storage terminal. The revenue associated with these agreements will come on-line upon completion of the construction of the new tank capacity. In December 2016, we placed into service 0.9 million barrels of the 2.0 million barrels of new tank capacity, and in February 2017 we placed into service an additional 0.3 million barrels. Completion of the remaining 0.8 million barrels of new tank capacity will occur in various stages through the second quarter of 2017. The anticipated aggregate cost of the 2.0 million barrels of new capacity is approximately $75 million. Construction of the Collins/Purvis expansion project commenced in the first quarter of 2016, and we have spent approximately $46 million as of February 28, 2017. Our Collins/Purvis terminal is strategically located for the bulk storage market and is the only independent terminal capable of receiving from, delivering to, and transferring refined\n\t\t\npetroleum products between the Colonial and Plantation pipeline systems. Our facility has current active storage capacity of approximately 4.6 million barrels and is expected to increase to approximately 5.4 million barrels once the remaining 0.8 million barrels of tankage is completed. We have also begun the process of permitting an additional 5.0 million barrels of capacity for future construction at our Collins/Purvis terminal and are in active discussions with several potential customers regarding this potential future capacity.\nCommercial re-contracting activity. Effective January 1, 2016, we re-contracted for an additional five years 2.7 million barrels of existing product storage capacity at our Collins/Purvis, Mississippi bulk storage terminals to an existing third-party customer. The new agreement contains an increase to the minimum throughput payments and is anticipated to generate additional minimum throughput revenue of $4.6 million annually.\nEffective July 1, 2016, we re-contracted for an additional five years a significant portion of our River terminals' capacity to an existing third-party customer. The new agreement is for similar capacity, contains higher rates and is anticipated to generate additional minimum throughput revenue in excess of $1.6 million annually.\nDuring June and July 2016, we contracted approximately 500,000 barrels of available capacity at our Port Manatee, Florida terminal to various third-party customers for terms that range between eight months to two years. The majority of this capacity had been uncontracted since May 2014, with the remaining capacity uncontracted since October 2015. With the addition of these new agreements, approximately 100% of our Gulf Coast terminals are now under contract with third-party customers.\nQuarterly distributions. On January 16, 2017, we announced a distribution of $0.71 per unit for the period from October 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. This distribution was paid on February 8, 2017 to unitholders of record on January 31, 2017. On October 17, 2016, we announced a distribution of $0.70 per unit for the period from July 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016. This distribution was paid on November 7, 2016 to unitholders of record on October 31, 2016. On July 18, 2016, we announced a distribution of $0.69 per unit for the period from April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016. This distribution was paid on August 8, 2016 to unitholders of record on July 29, 2016. On April 18, 2016, we announced a distribution of $0.68 per unit for the period from January 1, 2016 through March 31, 2016. This distribution was paid on May 9, 2016 to unitholders of record on April 29, 2016.\nCredit facility upsize and extension. On March 13 2017, we amended and restated our credit facility to extend the maturity date to March 31, 2022 and increase the maximum borrowing line of credit from $400 million to $600 million, and allow for up to $175 million in additional future permitted JV investments\u201d, which may include additional investments in BOSTCO. The amendment allows for, at our request, the maximum borrowing line of credit to be increased by an additional $250 million, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the receipt of additional commitments from one or more lenders.\nWe may elect to have loans under the credit facility bear interest either (i) at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin, or (ii) at the base rate plus a margin. The amendment decreased the rate of LIBOR plus a margin from a range of 2% to 3% to 1.75% to 2.75% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect and decreased the base rate plus a margin from 1% to 2% to 0.75% to 1.75% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect.\nNATURE OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES\nWe derive revenue from our terminal and pipeline transportation operations by charging fees for providing integrated terminaling, transportation and related services. The fees we charge, our other sources of revenue and our direct costs and expenses are described below.\nTerminaling services fees. We generate terminaling services fees by distributing and storing products for our customers. Terminaling services fees include throughput fees based on the volume of product distributed from the facility, injection fees based on the volume of product injected with additive compounds and storage fees based on a rate per barrel of storage capacity per month.\n\t\t\nPipeline transportation fees. We earn pipeline transportation fees at our Diamondback and Ella-Brownsville pipelines based on the volume of product transported and the distance from the origin point to the delivery point. We earn pipeline transportation fees at our Razorback pipeline based on an allocation of the aggregate fees charged under the capacity agreement with our customer who has contracted for 100% of our Razorback system. We own the Razorback and Diamondback pipelines, and we lease the Ella-Brownsville pipeline from a third party. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates the tariff on our pipelines.\nManagement fees and reimbursed costs. We manage and operate for a major oil company certain tank capacity at our Port Everglades South, Florida terminal and receive reimbursement of their proportionate share of operating and maintenance costs. We manage and operate for an affiliate of Mexico's state-owned petroleum company a bi-directional products pipeline connected to our Brownsville, Texas terminal facility and receive a management fee and reimbursement of costs. We manage and operate the Frontera terminal facility located in Brownsville, Texas for a management fee based on our costs incurred. Frontera is an unconsolidated affiliate for which we have a 50% ownership interest.\nOther revenue. We provide ancillary services including heating and mixing of stored products, product transfer, railcar handling, butane blending, wharfage and vapor recovery. Pursuant to terminaling services agreements with certain throughput customers, we are entitled to the volume of product gained resulting from differences in the measurement of product volumes received and distributed at our terminaling facilities. Consistent with recognized industry practices, measurement differentials occur as the result of the inherent variances in measurement devices and methodology. We recognize as revenue the net proceeds from the sale of the product gained.\nDirect operating costs and expenses. The direct operating costs and expenses of our operations include the directly related wages and employee benefits, utilities, communications, maintenance and repairs, property taxes, rent, vehicle expenses, environmental compliance costs, materials and supplies needed to operate our terminals and pipelines.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. The general and administrative expenses of our operations include an administrative fee paid to the owner of TransMontaigne GP for indirect corporate overhead to cover costs of centralized corporate functions such as legal, accounting, treasury, insurance administration and claims processing, health, safety and environmental, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, taxes, engineering and other corporate services. General and administrative expenses also include direct general and administrative expenses for third party accounting costs associated with annual and quarterly reports and tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, legal fees, independent director fees and equity-based compensation expense under the long-term incentive plan.\nInsurance expenses. Insurance expenses include charges for insurance premiums to cover costs of insuring activities such as property, casualty, pollution, automobile, directors' and officers' liability, and other insurable risks.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nA summary of the significant accounting policies that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our historical consolidated financial statements is detailed in Note 1 of Notes to consolidated financial statements. Certain of these accounting policies require the use of estimates. The following estimates, in management's opinion, are subjective in nature, require the exercise of judgment and involve complex analyses: useful lives of our plant and equipment and accrued environmental obligations. These estimates are based on our knowledge and understanding of current conditions and actions we may take in the future. Changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events. Subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nUseful lives of plant and equipment. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method, based on estimated useful lives of our assets. These estimates are based on various factors including age (in the case of acquired assets), manufacturing specifications, technological advances and historical data concerning useful lives of similar assets. Uncertainties that impact these estimates include changes in laws and regulations relating to restoration, economic conditions and supply and demand in the area. When assets are put into service, we make estimates with\n\t\t\nrespect to useful lives that we believe to be reasonable. However, subsequent events could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation. Estimated useful lives are 15 to 25 years for terminals and pipelines and 3 to 25 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment.\nAccrued environmental obligations. At December 31, 2016, we have an accrued liability of approximately $2.1 million representing our best estimate of the undiscounted future payments we expect to pay for environmental costs to remediate existing conditions. Estimates of our environmental obligations are subject to change due to a number of factors and judgments involved in the estimation process, including the early stage of investigation at certain sites, the lengthy time frames required to complete remediation, technology changes affecting remediation methods, alternative remediation methods and strategies and changes in environmental laws and regulations. Changes in our estimates and assumptions may occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events.\nCosts incurred to remediate existing contamination at the terminals we acquired from TransMontaigne LLC have been, and are expected in the future to be, insignificant. Pursuant to agreements with TransMontaigne LLC, TransMontaigne LLC retained 100% of these liabilities and indemnified us against certain potential environmental claims, losses and expenses associated with the operation of the acquired terminal facilities and occurring before our date of acquisition from TransMontaigne LLC, up to a maximum liability for these indemnification obligations (not to exceed $15.0 million for the Florida and Midwest terminals acquired on May 27, 2005, not to exceed $15.0 million for the Brownsville and River facilities acquired on December 31, 2006, not to exceed $15.0 million for the Southeast terminals acquired on December 31, 2007 and not to exceed $2.5 million for the Pensacola terminal acquired on March 1, 2011). The forgoing environmental indemnification obligations of TransMontaigne LLC to us remain in place and were not affected by the ArcLight acquisition.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS-YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014\nANALYSIS OF REVENUE\nTotal revenue. We derive revenue from our terminal and pipeline transportation operations by charging fees for providing integrated terminaling, transportation and related services. Our total revenue by category was as follows (in thousands):\n\nSee discussion below for a detailed analysis of terminaling services fees, pipeline transportation fees, management fees and reimbursed costs and other revenue included in the table above.\n\t\t\nWe operate our business and report our results of operations in five principal business segments: (i) Gulf Coast terminals, (ii) Midwest terminals and pipeline system, (iii) Brownsville terminals, (iv) River terminals and (v) Southeast terminals. The aggregate revenue of each of our business segments was as follows (in thousands):\n\nTotal revenue by business segment is presented and further analyzed below by category of revenue.\nTerminaling services fees. Pursuant to terminaling services agreements with our customers, which range from one month to several years in duration, we generate fees by distributing and storing products for our customers. Terminaling services fees include throughput fees based on the volume of product distributed from the facility, injection fees based on the volume of product injected with additive compounds and storage fees based on a rate per barrel of storage capacity per month. The terminaling services fees by business segments were as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe increase in terminaling services fees at our Gulf Coast terminals for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an increase of approximately $1.4 million resulting from the majority of the light oil tankage at our Port Manatee, Florida terminal being offline for approximately four months during the year ended December 31, 2015 in order to complete enhancements for a new customer at this facility. The enhanced tankage at Port Manatee became available to the third party customer in July of 2015. The increase in terminaling services fees at our Gulf Coast terminals also includes an increase of approximately $1.1 million resulting from the acquisition of the Port Everglades, Florida hydrant system on January 28, 2016 and an increase of approximately $0.8 million due to re-contracting our bunker fuel capacity at Port Manatee, vacant since May 31, 2014, to third party customers. The decrease in terminaling services fees at our Gulf Coast terminals for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 includes a decrease of approximately $1.1 million, resulting from an affiliate terminating its bunker fuels agreement at our Fisher Island, Cape Canaveral and Port Manatee, Florida terminals effective December 31, 2013, May 31, 2014 and May 31, 2014, respectively. Towards the end of 2014 and beginning in 2015, we were able to re-contract the bunker fuel capacity at our Cape Canaveral and Fisher Island terminals to third parties at similar rates to the preceding agreements. We re-contracted our bunker fuel capacity at Port Manatee on June 4, 2016 and July 16, 2016.\n\t\t\nThe increase in terminaling services fees at our Brownsville terminals for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 includes an increase of approximately $1.2 million due to additional LPG throughput resulting from the King Ranch gas plant becoming operational again in late November 2014. The plant, which was owned and operated by a third party, had been shut down since November 2013 due to a fire. The impact of the King Ranch gas plant fire is further discussed below in pipeline transportation fees. The increase in terminaling services fees at our Brownsville terminals also includes an increase of approximately $0.6 million resulting from us contracting 110,000 barrels of available capacity to a third party for a three year term commencing in May of 2015. The majority of this capacity had been vacant since the first quarter of 2014.\nThe increase in terminaling services fees at our Southeast terminals for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an increase of approximately $4.6 million resulting from us entering into a new five year agreement with a third party customer for approximately 2.7 million barrels of existing capacity at our Collins/Purvis, Mississippi bulk storage terminal, commencing January 1, 2016. The new agreement replaced the previous agreement we had with the third party customer for this tankage and contains an increase to the minimum throughput fees. The increase in terminaling services fees at our Southeast terminals also includes an increase of approximately $1.3 million from us entering into a new five year agreement with a third party customer for approximately 1.2 million barrels of existing and new capacity at our Collins/Purvis, Mississippi bulk storage terminal, commencing January 1, 2016. The majority of the approximately 1.2 million barrels of capacity represents new construction placed into service in December 2016.\nIncluded in terminaling services fees for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are fees charged to affiliates of approximately $3.1 million, $34.8 million and $59.0 million, respectively.\nOur terminaling services agreements are structured as either throughput agreements or storage agreements. Most of our throughput agreements contain provisions that require our customers to throughput a minimum volume of product at our facilities over a stipulated period of time, which results in a fixed amount of revenue to be recognized by us. Our storage agreements require our customers to make minimum payments based on the volume of storage capacity available to the customer under the agreement, which results in a fixed amount of revenue to be recognized by us. We refer to the fixed amount of revenue recognized pursuant to our terminaling services agreements as being firm commitments.\u201d Revenue recognized in excess of firm commitments and revenue recognized based solely on the volume of product distributed or injected are referred to as variable.\u201d The firm commitments\u201d and variable\u201d revenue included in terminaling services fees were as follows (in thousands):\n\n\t\t\nThe remaining terms on the terminaling services agreements that generated firm commitments\u201d for the year ended December 31, 2016 were as follows (in thousands):\n\nPipeline transportation fees. We earn pipeline transportation fees at our Diamondback and Ella-Brownsville pipelines based on the volume of product transported and the distance from the origin point to the delivery point. We earn pipeline transportation fees at our Razorback pipeline based on an allocation of the aggregate fees charged under the capacity agreement with our customer who has contracted for 100% of our Razorback system. We own the Razorback and Diamondback pipelines, and we lease the Ella-Brownsville pipeline from a third party. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates the tariff on our pipelines. The pipeline transportation fees by business segments were as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe increase in pipeline transportation fees at our Brownsville terminals for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from a November 2013 fire that shut down for approximately one full year the King Ranch natural gas processing plant in Kleberg County, Texas, which was owned and operated by a third party. The plant supplies a significant amount of LPG, to our third party customer who transports LPG on our Ella-Brownsville and Diamondback pipelines and has contracted for the LPG storage capacity at our Brownsville terminals.\nIncluded in pipeline transportation fees for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are fees charged to affiliates of approximately $nil, $nil and $0.2 million, respectively.\nManagement fees and reimbursed costs. We manage and operate for a major oil company certain tank capacity at our Port Everglades (South) terminal and receive reimbursement of their proportionate share of operating and maintenance costs. We manage and operate for an affiliate of Mexico's state-owned petroleum company a bi-directional products pipeline connected to our Brownsville, Texas terminal facility and receive a management fee and reimbursement of costs. We manage and operate the Frontera terminal facility located in Brownsville, Texas for a management fee based on our costs incurred. Frontera is an unconsolidated affiliate for which we have a 50% ownership interest. The management fees and reimbursed costs by business segments were as follows (in thousands):\n\t\t\n\nIncluded in management fees and reimbursed costs for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are fees charged to affiliates of approximately $5.0 million, $4.4 million and $4.4 million, respectively.\nOther revenue. We provide ancillary services including heating and mixing of stored products, product transfer, railcar handling, butane blending, wharfage and vapor recovery. Pursuant to terminaling services agreements with certain throughput customers, we are entitled to the volume of product gained resulting from differences in the measurement of product volumes received and distributed at our terminaling facilities. Consistent with recognized industry practices, measurement differentials occur as the result of the inherent variances in measurement devices and methodology. We recognize as revenue the net proceeds from the sale of the product gained. Other revenue is composed of the following (in thousands):\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we sold approximately 119,000, 117,000 and 140,000 barrels, respectively, of product gained resulting from differences in the measurement of product volumes received and distributed at our terminaling facilities at average prices of $57, $64 and $106 per barrel, respectively. Pursuant to our terminaling services agreement related to the Southeast terminals, we rebate our customer 50% of the proceeds we receive annually in excess of $4.2 million from the sale of product gains at our Southeast terminals. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have accrued a liability due to our customer of approximately $nil, representing our rebate liability. In January 2015, we paid approximately $1.8 million to our customer for the rebate due for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe change in steam heating fees, product transfer services and railcar handling, includes a decrease of approximately $2.2 million at our Brownsville terminals resulting from a third party customer terminating its agreement at the Brownsville terminals effective February 6, 2016. We recontracted a significant portion of the associated storage capacity effective September 1, 2016, but do not expect to earn as much in ancillary services under the new agreement.\nThe increase in other, included in other revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an approximately $1.9 million one-time payment to us at our Brownsville terminals related to the settlement of litigation with our LPG customer, an approximately $1.7 million one-time payment to us at our River terminals related to property\n\t\t\ndamage caused by a customer and an approximately $0.9 million one-time payment to us at our Gulf Coast terminals related to property damage caused by a customer. The increase in other, included in other revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 includes an approximately $2.6 million one-time early contract termination payment at our Gulf Coast terminals.\nIncluded in other revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are amounts charged to affiliates of approximately $0.3 million, $3.7 million and $10.6 million, respectively.\nThe other revenue by business segments were as follows (in thousands):\n\nANALYSIS OF COSTS AND EXPENSES\nThe direct operating costs and expenses of our operations include the directly related wages and employee benefits, utilities, communications, repairs and maintenance, rent, property taxes, vehicle expenses, environmental compliance costs, materials and supplies. Consistent with historical trends, repairs and maintenance expenses can vary year-to-year based on the timing of scheduled maintenance and unforeseen circumstances necessitating repairs to our terminals and pipelines. The direct operating costs and expenses of our operations were as follows (in thousands):\n\n\t\t\nThe direct operating costs and expenses of our business segments were as follows (in thousands):\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses include an administrative fee paid to the owner of TransMontainge GP for indirect corporate overhead to cover costs of centralized corporate functions such as legal, accounting, treasury, insurance administration and claims processing, health, safety and environmental, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, taxes, engineering and other corporate services. The administrative fee paid to the owner of TransMontainge GP for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $11.4 million, $11.3 million and $11.1 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses also include direct general and administrative expenses for third party accounting costs associated with annual and quarterly reports and tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, legal fees, independent director fees and equity-based compensation expense under the long-term incentive plan. The direct general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $3.4 million, $3.6 million and $3.5 million, respectively.\nInsurance expenses include charges for insurance premiums to cover costs of insuring activities such as property, casualty, pollution, automobile, directors' and officers' liability, and other insurable risks. Prior to October 31, 2016, we paid the owner of TransMontainge GP for insurance policies purchased on our behalf to cover our facilities and operations. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the insurance expense paid to the owner of TransMontaigne GP was approximately $3.1 million, $3.8 million and $3.7 million, respectively. On October 31, 2016, we contracted directly with insurance carriers for the majority of our insurance requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the expense associated with insurance contracted directly by us was $1.0 million, $nil and $nil, respectively.\nReimbursement of bonus awards includes expense associated with us reimbursing an affiliate of TransMontaigne GP for awards granted by them to certain key officers and employees who provide service to us that vest over future service periods. We have the intent and ability to settle our reimbursement for the bonus awards by issuing additional common units, and accordingly, we account for the bonus awards as an equity award. The expenses associated with these reimbursements were approximately $2.5 million, $1.3 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in reimbursement of bonus awards expense is primarily attributable to a portion of the 2015 grants vesting upon the change in control of our general partner as a result of the ArcLight acquisition, effective February 1, 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $32.4 million, $30.7 million and $29.5 million, respectively.\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $7.8 million, $7.4 million and $5.5 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to us no longer capitalizing interest on our investment in BOSTCO, as it was placed into service throughout the first three quarters of 2014.\n\t\t\nANALYSIS OF INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES\nAt December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our investments in unconsolidated affiliates include a 42.5% Class A ownership interest in BOSTCO and a 50% ownership interest in Frontera. BOSTCO is a terminal facility located on the Houston Ship Channel that encompasses approximately 7.1 million barrels of distillate, residual and other black oil product storage. Class A and Class B ownership interests share in cash distributions on a 96.5% and 3.5% basis, respectively. Class B ownership interests do not have voting rights and are not required to make capital investments. Frontera is a terminal facility located in Brownsville, Texas that encompasses approximately 1.5 million barrels of light petroleum product storage, as well as related ancillary facilities.\nThe following table summarizes our investments in unconsolidated affiliates:\n\nEarnings from investments in unconsolidated affiliates were as follows (in thousands):\n\nAdditional capital investments in unconsolidated affiliates were as follows (in thousands):\n\nCash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates were as follows (in thousands):\n\n\t\t\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary liquidity needs are to fund our working capital requirements, distributions to unitholders, approved investments, approved capital projects and approved future expansion, development and acquisition opportunities. We expect to initially fund any investments, capital projects and future expansion, development and acquisition opportunities with undistributed cash flows from operations and additional borrowings under our credit facility. After initially funding expenditures with borrowings under our credit facility, we may raise funds through additional equity offerings and debt financings. The proceeds of such equity offerings and debt financings may then be used to reduce our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility.\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities were as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe decrease in net cash provided by operating activities includes a decrease in distributions received from our investment in BOSTCO, which is primarily attributable to a one-time gain resulting from a contract buy-out by one of the BOSTCO customers in April of 2015. Our share of the gain in the prior year was approximately $3.4 million, which we received in cash as a component of our third quarter 2015 distribution from BOSTCO. The change in net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by the timing of working capital requirements and increased net margins.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities includes an increase of $12.0 million for the acquisition of the Port Everglades, Florida hydrant system and an increase of approximately $25.4 million in capital expenditures, primarily related to the construction of approximately 2.0 million barrels of new storage capacity at our Collins/Purvis, Mississippi bulk storage terminal. Management and the board of directors of our general partner have approved additional investments and expansion capital projects at our terminals that currently are, or will be, under construction with estimated completion dates that extend through the first quarter of 2018. At December 31, 2016, the remaining expenditures to complete the approved projects are estimated to be approximately $40 million, which primarily relates to the remaining construction costs associated with the approximately 2.0 million barrels of new storage capacity at our Collins/Purvis bulk storage terminal.\nThe decrease in net cash used in financing activities includes an increase of $47.8 million in net borrowings under our credit facility to help fund the increase in investing activities.\nThird amended and restated senior secured credit facility. On March 13, 2017, we entered into the third amended and restated senior secured credit facility, or the credit facility\u201d, that provides for a maximum borrowing line of credit equal to $600 million. At our request, the maximum borrowing line of credit may be increased by an additional $250 million, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the receipt of additional commitments from one or more lenders. The terms of the credit facility include covenants that restrict our ability to make cash distributions, acquisitions and investments, including investments in joint ventures. We may make distributions of cash to the extent of our available cash\u201d as defined in our partnership agreement. We may make acquisitions and investments that meet the definition of permitted acquisitions\u201d; other investments\u201d which may not exceed 5% of consolidated net tangible assets\u201d; and additional future permitted JV investments\u201d up to $175 million, which may include additional investments in BOSTCO. The principal balance of loans and any accrued and unpaid interest are due and payable in full on the maturity date, March 31, 2022.\nWe may elect to have loans under the credit facility bear interest either (i) at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.75% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect, or (ii) at the base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.75% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect. We also pay a commitment fee on the\n\t\t\nunused amount of commitments, ranging from 0.375% to 0.5% per annum, depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect. Our obligations under the credit facility are secured by a first priority security interest in favor of the lenders in the majority of our assets, including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates. At December 31, 2016, our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility were $291.8 million.\nThe credit facility also contains customary representations and warranties (including those relating to organization and authorization, compliance with laws, absence of defaults, material agreements and litigation) and customary events of default (including those relating to monetary defaults, covenant defaults, cross defaults and bankruptcy events). The primary financial covenants contained in the credit facility are (i) a total leverage ratio test (not to exceed 4.75 times), (ii) a senior secured leverage ratio test (not to exceed 3.75 times) in the event we issue senior unsecured notes, and (iii) a minimum interest coverage ratio test (not less than 3.0 times). These financial covenants are based on a non-GAAP, defined financial performance measure within the credit facility known as Consolidated EBITDA.\u201d The calculation of the total leverage ratio\u201d and interest coverage ratio\u201d contained in the credit facility is as follows (in thousands, except ratios):\n\n (1) Consolidated interest expense, used in the calculation of the interest coverage ratio, excludes unrealized gains and losses recognized on our derivative instruments. \nIf we were to fail either financial performance covenant, or any other covenant contained in the credit facility, we", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a refined petroleum products terminaling and pipeline transportation company formed in February 2005 as a Delaware limited partnership. We are controlled by our general partner, TransMontaigne GP, which as of February 1, 2016, is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of ArcLight. Prior to February 1, 2016, TransMontaigne LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NGL, owned all of the issued and outstanding ownership interests of TransMontaigne GP. At December 31, 2016, our operations are composed of:\n \u00b7 Eight refined product terminals located in Florida ( Gulf Coast terminals\u201d), with an aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 6.9 million barrels, that provide integrated terminaling services to NGL, RaceTrac Petroleum Inc., Glencore Ltd., Trafigura, World Fuel Services Corporation, ExxonMobil Oil Corporation, United States Government, Motiva Enterprises LLC, and other distribution and marketing companies. \n \u00b7 A 67-mile interstate refined products pipeline, which we refer to as the Razorback pipeline, that transports gasoline and distillates for customers of Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P. from our two refined product terminals, one located in Mount Vernon, Missouri and the other located in Rogers, Arkansas, which we refer to as our Razorback terminals. These terminals have an aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 421,000 barrels and are leased to Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P. under a ten-year capacity agreement. \n \u00b7 One crude oil terminal located in Cushing, Oklahoma with an aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 1.0 million barrels that provides integrated terminaling services to Castleton Commodities International LLC. \n \u00b7 One refined product terminal located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, with aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 0.2 million barrels, that provides integrated terminaling services to a third party distribution and marketing company. \n \u00b7 One refined product terminal located in Brownsville, Texas with aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 0.9 million barrels that provides integrated terminaling services to Nieto Trading, B.V., PMI Trading Ltd. and other distribution and marketing companies. \n \u00b7 A 16-mile LPG pipeline, which we refer to as the Diamondback pipeline, that extends from our Brownsville, Texas facility to the U.S./Mexico border. At the U.S border the Diamondback pipeline connects to a pipeline and storage terminal in Matamoros, Mexico, owned by Nieto Trading, B.V. \n\t\t\n \u00b7 A pipeline leased from the Seadrift Pipeline Corporation, which we refer to as the Ella-Brownsville pipeline. The pipeline transports LPG from two points of origin to our terminal in Brownsville: from the King Ranch in Kleberg County, Texas owned and operated by a third party for 121 miles to Brownsville and an additional 11 miles beginning near the King Ranch terminus to the DCP LaGloria Gas Plant in Jim Wells County, Texas. \n \u00b7 A 50/50 joint venture with PMI, an indirect subsidiary of PEMEX, for the operation of the Frontera light petroleum products terminal located in Brownsville, Texas with an aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 1.5 million barrels that provides services to PMI Trading Ltd. and other distribution and marketing companies. \n \u00b7 A 42.5%, general voting, Class A Member ownership interest in BOSTCO. BOSTCO is a new fully subscribed, 7.1 million barrel terminal facility on the Houston Ship Channel designed to handle residual fuel, feedstocks, distillates and other black oils. The BOSTCO facility began initial commercial operations in the fourth quarter of 2013. Completion of the approximately 7.1 million barrels of storage capacity and related infrastructure occurred at the end of the third quarter of 2014. \n \u00b7 Twelve refined product terminals located along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers ( River terminals\u201d) with aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 2.7 million barrels and the Baton Rouge, Louisiana dock facility that provide integrated terminaling services to Valero Marketing and Supply Company and other distribution and marketing companies. \n \u00b7 Twenty-two refined product terminals located along the Colonial and Plantation pipelines ( Southeast terminals\u201d) with aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 11.0 million barrels that provides integrated terminaling services to NGL, Castleton Commodities International LLC and the United States Government. \nWe provide integrated terminaling, storage, transportation and related services for customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of light refined petroleum products, heavy refined petroleum products, crude oil, chemicals, fertilizers and other liquid products. Light refined products include gasolines, diesel fuels, heating oil and jet fuels. Heavy refined products include residual fuel oils and asphalt.\nWe do not take ownership of or market products that we handle or transport and, therefore, we are not directly exposed to changes in commodity prices, except for the value of product gains and losses arising from certain of our terminaling services agreements with our customers. The volume of product that is handled, transported through or stored in our terminals and pipelines is directly affected by the level of supply and demand in the wholesale markets served by our terminals and pipelines. Overall supply of refined products in the wholesale markets is influenced by the products' absolute prices, the availability of capacity on delivering pipelines and vessels, fluctuating refinery margins and the markets' perception of future product prices. The demand for gasoline typically peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from April to September, and declines during the fall and winter months. The demand for marine fuels typically peaks in the winter months due to the increase in the number of cruise ships originating from the Florida ports. Despite these seasonalities, the overall impact on the volume of product throughput in our terminals and pipelines is not material.\nOur customer base has diversified over the past couple of years away from affiliates to third party customers. As of December 31, 2016 affiliates are no longer our largest customers and our agreements with them do not provide a substantial amount of our revenue. Our revenue from affiliates represents approximately 5%, 28% and 49%, of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and is primarily earned pursuant to terminaling services agreements. (See Note 2 of Notes to consolidated financial statements).\n\t\t\nSIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE FILING OF OUR PRIOR YEAR FORM 10-K\nChange in control of the ownership of our general partner. Effective February 1, 2016, NGL consummated the sale of its indirect 100% ownership interest in TransMontaigne GP to ArcLight for $350 million in cash. TransMontaigne GP is our general partner and holds a 2% general partner interest and incentive distribution rights. The ArcLight acquisition resulted in a change in control of our partnership. The February 1, 2016 ArcLight acquisition did not involve any of our limited partnership units held by the public, and our limited partnership units continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, on April 1, 2016, affiliates of ArcLight acquired approximately 3.2 million of our common LP units from NGL. With the purchase of the common units, ArcLight has a significant interest in our partnership through their ownership of the general partner interest, the incentive distribution rights and approximately 20% of the limited partner interests.\nArcLight is one of the leading private equity firms focused on North American and Western European energy assets. Since its establishment in 2001, ArcLight has invested over $17 billion across multiple energy cycles in more than 100 investments. Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts with an additional office in Luxembourg, the firm's investment team brings extensive energy expertise, industry relationships and specialized value creation capabilities to our operations.\nUpon the closing of the ArcLight acquisition, Atanas H. Atanasov, Benjamin Borgen, Brian Cannon and Donald M. Jensen, each employees of NGL, resigned from the board of directors of our general partner. To fill the vacancies resulting from the resignation of the NGL directors, Daniel R. Revers, Kevin M. Crosby and Lucius H. Taylor, each employees of ArcLight, were appointed to the board of directors of our general partner effective February 1, 2016. On February 22, 2016, Theodore D. Burke, an employee of ArcLight, was appointed to the board of directors of our general partner. On July 19, 2016, Robert A. Burk and Lawrence C. Ross notified the partnership of their intention to resign from the board of directors of our general partner and the audit, compensation and conflicts committees thereof, effective July 21, 2016. On July 21, 2016 the board of directors of our general partner appointed Jay A. Wiese and Barry E. Welch to serve as independent members of the board of directors of our general partner. Mr. Wiese was elected to serve as the chairman of the compensation committee of our general partner and as a member of the audit and conflicts committees. Mr. Welch was elected to serve as the chairman of the conflicts committee of our general partner and as a member of the audit and compensation committees.\nIn connection with the ArcLight acquisition, our Southeast terminaling services agreement with NGL was amended to extend the term of the agreement through July 31, 2040 at the prevailing contract rate terms contained within the agreement. Subsequent to January 31, 2023, NGL has the ability to terminate the agreement at any time upon at least 24 months' prior notice of its intent to terminate the agreement. In addition, we also entered into a second amended and restated omnibus agreement to assign it from TransMontaigne LLC to ArcLight and remove certain legacy provisions that were no longer applicable to our partnership. Under the second amended and restated omnibus agreement, we pay ArcLight (and prior to the ArcLight acquisition, we paid TransMontaigne LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NGL) an administrative fee for the provision of certain management, legal, accounting, tax, corporate staff, engineering and other support services. The second amended and restated omnibus agreement will continue in effect until the earlier to occur of (i) ArcLight ceasing to control our general partner or (ii) the election of us or ArcLight, following at least 24 months' prior written notice to the other party of the intent to terminate the agreement. The amendment did not change the financial terms, substantive rights or obligations of the parties under the omnibus agreement.\nExpansion of the Collins/Purvis bulk storage terminal. We previously entered into long-term terminaling services agreements with various parties for approximately 2.0 million barrels of new storage capacity at our Collins/Purvis, Mississippi bulk storage terminal. The revenue associated with these agreements will come on-line upon completion of the construction of the new tank capacity. In December 2016, we placed into service 0.9 million barrels of the 2.0 million barrels of new tank capacity, and in February 2017 we placed into service an additional 0.3 million barrels. Completion of the remaining 0.8 million barrels of new tank capacity will occur in various stages through the second quarter of 2017. The anticipated aggregate cost of the 2.0 million barrels of new capacity is approximately $75 million. Construction of the Collins/Purvis expansion project commenced in the first quarter of 2016, and we have spent approximately $46 million as of February 28, 2017. Our Collins/Purvis terminal is strategically located for the bulk storage market and is the only independent terminal capable of receiving from, delivering to, and transferring refined\n\t\t\npetroleum products between the Colonial and Plantation pipeline systems. Our facility has current active storage capacity of approximately 4.6 million barrels and is expected to increase to approximately 5.4 million barrels once the remaining 0.8 million barrels of tankage is completed. We have also begun the process of permitting an additional 5.0 million barrels of capacity for future construction at our Collins/Purvis terminal and are in active discussions with several potential customers regarding this potential future capacity.\nCommercial re-contracting activity. Effective January 1, 2016, we re-contracted for an additional five years 2.7 million barrels of existing product storage capacity at our Collins/Purvis, Mississippi bulk storage terminals to an existing third-party customer. The new agreement contains an increase to the minimum throughput payments and is anticipated to generate additional minimum throughput revenue of $4.6 million annually.\nEffective July 1, 2016, we re-contracted for an additional five years a significant portion of our River terminals' capacity to an existing third-party customer. The new agreement is for similar capacity, contains higher rates and is anticipated to generate additional minimum throughput revenue in excess of $1.6 million annually.\nDuring June and July 2016, we contracted approximately 500,000 barrels of available capacity at our Port Manatee, Florida terminal to various third-party customers for terms that range between eight months to two years. The majority of this capacity had been uncontracted since May 2014, with the remaining capacity uncontracted since October 2015. With the addition of these new agreements, approximately 100% of our Gulf Coast terminals are now under contract with third-party customers.\nQuarterly distributions. On January 16, 2017, we announced a distribution of $0.71 per unit for the period from October 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. This distribution was paid on February 8, 2017 to unitholders of record on January 31, 2017. On October 17, 2016, we announced a distribution of $0.70 per unit for the period from July 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016. This distribution was paid on November 7, 2016 to unitholders of record on October 31, 2016. On July 18, 2016, we announced a distribution of $0.69 per unit for the period from April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016. This distribution was paid on August 8, 2016 to unitholders of record on July 29, 2016. On April 18, 2016, we announced a distribution of $0.68 per unit for the period from January 1, 2016 through March 31, 2016. This distribution was paid on May 9, 2016 to unitholders of record on April 29, 2016.\nCredit facility upsize and extension. On March 13 2017, we amended and restated our credit facility to extend the maturity date to March 31, 2022 and increase the maximum borrowing line of credit from $400 million to $600 million, and allow for up to $175 million in additional future permitted JV investments\u201d, which may include additional investments in BOSTCO. The amendment allows for, at our request, the maximum borrowing line of credit to be increased by an additional $250 million, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the receipt of additional commitments from one or more lenders.\nWe may elect to have loans under the credit facility bear interest either (i) at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin, or (ii) at the base rate plus a margin. The amendment decreased the rate of LIBOR plus a margin from a range of 2% to 3% to 1.75% to 2.75% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect and decreased the base rate plus a margin from 1% to 2% to 0.75% to 1.75% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect.\nNATURE OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES\nWe derive revenue from our terminal and pipeline transportation operations by charging fees for providing integrated terminaling, transportation and related services. The fees we charge, our other sources of revenue and our direct costs and expenses are described below.\nTerminaling services fees. We generate terminaling services fees by distributing and storing products for our customers. Terminaling services fees include throughput fees based on the volume of product distributed from the facility, injection fees based on the volume of product injected with additive compounds and storage fees based on a rate per barrel of storage capacity per month.\n\t\t\nPipeline transportation fees. We earn pipeline transportation fees at our Diamondback and Ella-Brownsville pipelines based on the volume of product transported and the distance from the origin point to the delivery point. We earn pipeline transportation fees at our Razorback pipeline based on an allocation of the aggregate fees charged under the capacity agreement with our customer who has contracted for 100% of our Razorback system. We own the Razorback and Diamondback pipelines, and we lease the Ella-Brownsville pipeline from a third party. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates the tariff on our pipelines.\nManagement fees and reimbursed costs. We manage and operate for a major oil company certain tank capacity at our Port Everglades South, Florida terminal and receive reimbursement of their proportionate share of operating and maintenance costs. We manage and operate for an affiliate of Mexico's state-owned petroleum company a bi-directional products pipeline connected to our Brownsville, Texas terminal facility and receive a management fee and reimbursement of costs. We manage and operate the Frontera terminal facility located in Brownsville, Texas for a management fee based on our costs incurred. Frontera is an unconsolidated affiliate for which we have a 50% ownership interest.\nOther revenue. We provide ancillary services including heating and mixing of stored products, product transfer, railcar handling, butane blending, wharfage and vapor recovery. Pursuant to terminaling services agreements with certain throughput customers, we are entitled to the volume of product gained resulting from differences in the measurement of product volumes received and distributed at our terminaling facilities. Consistent with recognized industry practices, measurement differentials occur as the result of the inherent variances in measurement devices and methodology. We recognize as revenue the net proceeds from the sale of the product gained.\nDirect operating costs and expenses. The direct operating costs and expenses of our operations include the directly related wages and employee benefits, utilities, communications, maintenance and repairs, property taxes, rent, vehicle expenses, environmental compliance costs, materials and supplies needed to operate our terminals and pipelines.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. The general and administrative expenses of our operations include an administrative fee paid to the owner of TransMontaigne GP for indirect corporate overhead to cover costs of centralized corporate functions such as legal, accounting, treasury, insurance administration and claims processing, health, safety and environmental, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, taxes, engineering and other corporate services. General and administrative expenses also include direct general and administrative expenses for third party accounting costs associated with annual and quarterly reports and tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, legal fees, independent director fees and equity-based compensation expense under the long-term incentive plan.\nInsurance expenses. Insurance expenses include charges for insurance premiums to cover costs of insuring activities such as property, casualty, pollution, automobile, directors' and officers' liability, and other insurable risks.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nA summary of the significant accounting policies that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our historical consolidated financial statements is detailed in Note 1 of Notes to consolidated financial statements. Certain of these accounting policies require the use of estimates. The following estimates, in management's opinion, are subjective in nature, require the exercise of judgment and involve complex analyses: useful lives of our plant and equipment and accrued environmental obligations. These estimates are based on our knowledge and understanding of current conditions and actions we may take in the future. Changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events. Subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nUseful lives of plant and equipment. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method, based on estimated useful lives of our assets. These estimates are based on various factors including age (in the case of acquired assets), manufacturing specifications, technological advances and historical data concerning useful lives of similar assets. Uncertainties that impact these estimates include changes in laws and regulations relating to restoration, economic conditions and supply and demand in the area. When assets are put into service, we make estimates with\n\t\t\nrespect to useful lives that we believe to be reasonable. However, subsequent events could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation. Estimated useful lives are 15 to 25 years for terminals and pipelines and 3 to 25 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment.\nAccrued environmental obligations. At December 31, 2016, we have an accrued liability of approximately $2.1 million representing our best estimate of the undiscounted future payments we expect to pay for environmental costs to remediate existing conditions. Estimates of our environmental obligations are subject to change due to a number of factors and judgments involved in the estimation process, including the early stage of investigation at certain sites, the lengthy time frames required to complete remediation, technology changes affecting remediation methods, alternative remediation methods and strategies and changes in environmental laws and regulations. Changes in our estimates and assumptions may occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events.\nCosts incurred to remediate existing contamination at the terminals we acquired from TransMontaigne LLC have been, and are expected in the future to be, insignificant. Pursuant to agreements with TransMontaigne LLC, TransMontaigne LLC retained 100% of these liabilities and indemnified us against certain potential environmental claims, losses and expenses associated with the operation of the acquired terminal facilities and occurring before our date of acquisition from TransMontaigne LLC, up to a maximum liability for these indemnification obligations (not to exceed $15.0 million for the Florida and Midwest terminals acquired on May 27, 2005, not to exceed $15.0 million for the Brownsville and River facilities acquired on December 31, 2006, not to exceed $15.0 million for the Southeast terminals acquired on December 31, 2007 and not to exceed $2.5 million for the Pensacola terminal acquired on March 1, 2011). The forgoing environmental indemnification obligations of TransMontaigne LLC to us remain in place and were not affected by the ArcLight acquisition.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS-YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014\nANALYSIS OF REVENUE\nTotal revenue.

Pursuant to terminaling services agreements with our customers, which range from one month to several years in duration, we generate fees by distributing and storing products for our customers. Terminaling services fees include throughput fees based on the volume of product distributed from the facility, injection fees based on the volume of product injected with additive compounds and storage fees based on a rate per barrel of storage capacity per month. The terminaling services fees by business segments were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTerminaling Services Fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nby Business Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGulf Coast terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n45,903 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n42,049 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n43,777 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMidwest terminals and pipeline system\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,590 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,330 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,164 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBrownsville terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,234 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,037 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,280 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRiver terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,664 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,316 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,566 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSoutheast terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n53,699 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,503 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45,070 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTerminaling services fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n126,090 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n114,235 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n111,857 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in terminaling services fees at our Gulf Coast terminals for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an increase of approximately $1.4 million resulting from the majority of the light oil tankage at our Port Manatee, Florida terminal being offline for approximately four months during the year ended December 31, 2015 in order to complete enhancements for a new customer at this facility. The enhanced tankage at Port Manatee became available to the third party customer in July of 2015. The increase in terminaling services fees at our Gulf Coast terminals also includes an increase of approximately $1.1 million resulting from the acquisition of the Port Everglades, Florida hydrant system on January 28, 2016 and an increase of approximately $0.8 million due to re-contracting our bunker fuel capacity at Port Manatee, vacant since May 31, 2014, to third party customers. The decrease in terminaling services fees at our Gulf Coast terminals for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 includes a decrease of approximately $1.1 million, resulting from an affiliate terminating its bunker fuels agreement at our Fisher Island, Cape Canaveral and Port Manatee, Florida terminals effective December 31, 2013, May 31, 2014 and May 31, 2014, respectively. Towards the end of 2014 and beginning in 2015, we were able to re-contract the bunker fuel capacity at our Cape Canaveral and Fisher Island terminals to third parties at similar rates to the preceding agreements. We re-contracted our bunker fuel capacity at Port Manatee on June 4, 2016 and July 16, 2016.\n\t\t\nThe increase in terminaling services fees at our Brownsville terminals for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 includes an increase of approximately $1.2 million due to additional LPG throughput resulting from the King Ranch gas plant becoming operational again in late November 2014. The plant, which was owned and operated by a third party, had been shut down since November 2013 due to a fire. The impact of the King Ranch gas plant fire is further discussed below in pipeline transportation fees. The increase in terminaling services fees at our Brownsville terminals also includes an increase of approximately $0.6 million resulting from us contracting 110,000 barrels of available capacity to a third party for a three year term commencing in May of 2015. The majority of this capacity had been vacant since the first quarter of 2014.\nThe increase in terminaling services fees at our Southeast terminals for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an increase of approximately $4.6 million resulting from us entering into a new five year agreement with a third party customer for approximately 2.7 million barrels of existing capacity at our Collins/Purvis, Mississippi bulk storage terminal, commencing January 1, 2016. The new agreement replaced the previous agreement we had with the third party customer for this tankage and contains an increase to the minimum throughput fees. The increase in terminaling services fees at our Southeast terminals also includes an increase of approximately $1.3 million from us entering into a new five year agreement with a third party customer for approximately 1.2 million barrels of existing and new capacity at our Collins/Purvis, Mississippi bulk storage terminal, commencing January 1, 2016. The majority of the approximately 1.2 million barrels of capacity represents new construction placed into service in December 2016.\nIncluded in terminaling services fees for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are fees charged to affiliates of approximately $3.1 million, $34.8 million and $59.0 million, respectively.\nOur terminaling services agreements are structured as either throughput agreements or storage agreements. Most of our throughput agreements contain provisions that require our customers to throughput a minimum volume of product at our facilities over a stipulated period of time, which results in a fixed amount of revenue to be recognized by us. Our storage agreements require our customers to make minimum payments based on the volume of storage capacity available to the customer under the agreement, which results in a fixed amount of revenue to be recognized by us. We refer to the fixed amount of revenue recognized pursuant to our terminaling services agreements as being firm commitments.\u201d Revenue recognized in excess of firm commitments and revenue recognized based solely on the volume of product distributed or injected are referred to as variable.\u201d The firm commitments\u201d and variable\u201d revenue included in terminaling services fees were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFirm Commitments and Variable Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFirm commitments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExternal customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n113,484 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n75,218 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n49,024 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAffiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,857 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31,856 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,226 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n116,341 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n107,074 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n107,250 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVariable:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExternal customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,486 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,169 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,789 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAffiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,992 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,749 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,161 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,607 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTerminaling services fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n126,090 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n114,235 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n111,857 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\nThe remaining terms on the terminaling services agreements that generated firm commitments\u201d for the year ended December 31, 2016 were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess than 1 year remaining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,875 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n1 year or more, but less than 3 years remaining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40,852 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n3 years or more, but less than 5 years remaining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32,187 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n5 years or more remaining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34,427 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal firm commitments for the year ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n116,341 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPipeline transportation fees.

TransMontainge GP for indirect corporate overhead to cover costs of centralized corporate functions such as legal, accounting, treasury, insurance administration and claims processing, health, safety and environmental, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, taxes, engineering and other corporate services. The administrative fee paid to the owner of TransMontainge GP for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $11.4 million, $11.3 million and $11.1 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses also include direct general and administrative expenses for third party accounting costs associated with annual and quarterly reports and tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, legal fees, independent director fees and equity-based compensation expense under the long-term incentive plan. The direct general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $3.4 million, $3.6 million and $3.5 million, respectively.\nInsurance expenses include charges for insurance premiums to cover costs of insuring activities such as property, casualty, pollution, automobile, directors' and officers' liability, and other insurable risks. Prior to October 31, 2016, we paid the owner of TransMontainge GP for insurance policies purchased on our behalf to cover our facilities and operations. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the insurance expense paid to the owner of TransMontaigne GP was approximately $3.1 million, $3.8 million and $3.7 million, respectively. On October 31, 2016, we contracted directly with insurance carriers for the majority of our insurance requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the expense associated with insurance contracted directly by us was $1.0 million, $nil and $nil, respectively.\nReimbursement of bonus awards includes expense associated with us reimbursing an affiliate of TransMontaigne GP for awards granted by them to certain key officers and employees who provide service to us that vest over future service periods. We have the intent and ability to settle our reimbursement for the bonus awards by issuing additional common units, and accordingly, we account for the bonus awards as an equity award. The expenses associated with these reimbursements were approximately $2.5 million, $1.3 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in reimbursement of bonus awards expense is primarily attributable to a portion of the 2015 grants vesting upon the change in control of our general partner as a result of the ArcLight acquisition, effective February 1, 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $32.4 million, $30.7 million and $29.5 million, respectively.\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $7.8 million, $7.4 million and $5.5 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to us no longer capitalizing interest on our investment in BOSTCO, as it was placed into service throughout the first three quarters of 2014.\n\t\t\nANALYSIS OF INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES\nAt December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our investments in unconsolidated affiliates include a 42.5% Class A ownership interest in BOSTCO and a 50% ownership interest in Frontera.

We expect to initially fund any investments, capital projects and future expansion, development and acquisition opportunities with undistributed cash flows from operations and additional borrowings under our credit facility. After initially funding expenditures with borrowings under our credit facility, we may raise funds through additional equity offerings and debt financings. The proceeds of such equity offerings and debt financings may then be used to reduce our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility.\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n79,107 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n87,480 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n60,929 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(69,089) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(34,153) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(50,702) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(10,106) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(55,950) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(10,186) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in net cash provided by operating activities includes a decrease in distributions received from our investment in BOSTCO, which is primarily attributable to a one-time gain resulting from a contract buy-out by one of the BOSTCO customers in April of 2015. Our share of the gain in the prior year was approximately $3.4 million, which we received in cash as a component of our third quarter 2015 distribution from BOSTCO. The change in net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by the timing of working capital requirements and increased net margins.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities includes an increase of $12.0 million for the acquisition of the Port Everglades, Florida hydrant system and an increase of approximately $25.4 million in capital expenditures, primarily related to the construction of approximately 2.0 million barrels of new storage capacity at our Collins/Purvis, Mississippi bulk storage terminal. Management and the board of directors of our general partner have approved additional investments and expansion capital projects at our terminals that currently are, or will be, under construction with estimated completion dates that extend through the first quarter of 2018. At December 31, 2016, the remaining expenditures to complete the approved projects are estimated to be approximately $40 million, which primarily relates to the remaining construction costs associated with the approximately 2.0 million barrels of new storage capacity at our Collins/Purvis bulk storage terminal.\nThe decrease in net cash used in financing activities includes an increase of $47.8 million in net borrowings under our credit facility to help fund the increase in investing activities.\nThird amended and restated senior secured credit facility. On March 13, 2017, we entered into the third amended and restated senior secured credit facility, or the credit facility\u201d, that provides for a maximum borrowing line of credit equal to $600 million. At our request, the maximum borrowing line of credit may be increased by an additional $250 million, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the receipt of additional commitments from one or more lenders. The terms of the credit facility include covenants that restrict our ability to make cash distributions, acquisitions and investments, including investments in joint ventures. We may make distributions of cash to the extent of our available cash\u201d as defined in our partnership agreement. We may make acquisitions and investments that meet the definition of permitted acquisitions\u201d; other investments\u201d which may not exceed 5% of consolidated net tangible assets\u201d; and additional future permitted JV investments\u201d up to $175 million, which may include additional investments in BOSTCO. The principal balance of loans and any accrued and unpaid interest are due and payable in full on the maturity date, March 31, 2022.\nWe may elect to have loans under the credit facility bear interest either (i) at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.75% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect, or (ii) at the base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.75% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect. We also pay a commitment fee on the\n\t\t\nunused amount of commitments, ranging from 0.375% to 0.5% per annum, depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect. Our obligations under the credit facility are secured by a first priority security interest in favor of the lenders in the majority of our assets, including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates. At December 31, 2016, our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility were $291.8 million.\nThe credit facility also contains customary representations and warranties (including those relating to organization and authorization, compliance with laws, absence of defaults, material agreements and litigation) and customary events of default (including those relating to monetary defaults, covenant defaults, cross defaults and bankruptcy events). The primary financial covenants contained in the credit facility are (i) a total leverage ratio test (not to exceed 4.75 times), (ii) a senior secured leverage ratio test (not to exceed 3.75 times) in the event we issue senior unsecured notes, and (iii) a minimum interest coverage ratio test (not less than 3.0 times). These financial covenants are based on a non-GAAP, defined financial performance measure within the credit facility known as Consolidated EBITDA.\u201d The calculation of the total leverage ratio\u201d and interest coverage ratio\u201d contained in the credit facility is as follows (in thousands, except ratios):\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>
