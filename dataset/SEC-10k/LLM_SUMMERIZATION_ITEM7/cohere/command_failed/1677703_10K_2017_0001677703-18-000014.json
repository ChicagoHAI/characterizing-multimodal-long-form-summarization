MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Conduent Incorporated. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. This MD&A provides additional information about our operations, current developments, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThroughout the MD&A, we refer to various notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements which appear in Item 8 of this 2017 Form 10-K, and the information contained in such notes is incorporated by reference into the MD&A in the places where such references are made.\nOverview\nWith revenues of $6.0 billion, we are a leading provider of business process services with expertise in transaction-intensive processing, analytics and automation. We serve as a trusted business partner in both the front office and back office, enabling personalized, seamless interactions on a massive scale that improve end-user experience.\nHeadquartered in Florham Park, New Jersey, we, have a team of approximately 90,000 people as of December 31, 2017, who serves customers in 31 countries. In 2017, 12% of our revenue was generated outside the U.S.\nOur reportable segments correspond to how we organize and manage the business and are aligned to the industries in which our clients operate.\nBeginning in 2017, in an effort to better reflect how we manage our business, we changed our reporting segments to align the Healthcare business based upon customer focus between Commercial Industries and Public Sector.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Commercial Industries - Our Commercial Industries segment provides business process services and customized solutions to clients in a variety of industries. Across the Commercial Industries segment, we deliver end-to-end business-to-business and business-to-customer services that enable our clients to optimize their key processes. Our multi-industry competencies include transaction processing, customer experience, human resource management, omni-channel communications and finance and accounting services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Public Sector - Our Public Sector segment provides government-centric business process services to U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments for transportation, public assistance, program administration, transaction processing and payment services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Other includes our Government HE Medicaid Platform business, where we are limiting our focus to maintaining systems for our current clients; our Education Business inclusive of our Student Loan business, which is in runoff; and inter-segment eliminations.\nSignificant 2017 Actions\nDispositions\nIn 2017, we completed divestitures of: (1) our Firehouse business and suite of emergency records management products used by fire departments across the country for their incident reporting and Emergency Management System information and records management; (2) our healthcare provider consulting services business, which advises healthcare organizations on IT application optimization; (3) the Breakaway Group business, which provides advisory project services to assist healthcare organizations optimize their health IT applications; (4) the mobile device management business of Wireless Data Services Limited; and (5) the Global Mobility business. The aggregate proceeds for these divestitures was $56 million in cash. The businesses sold represent $60 million and $82 million of 2017 and 2016 revenue, respectively. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $16 million on these divestitures for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 27\nIn addition, in 2017, we sold a property located in Dallas, Texas, which was formerly the Affiliated Computer Services (ACS) headquarters, for a pre-tax gain of $24 million. This was part of our effort to consolidate our real estate footprint.\nHealth Enterprise Settlement\nOn November 28, 2017, we entered into a definitive settlement agreement with the State of New York regarding resolution of the HE platform project. Under the terms of the settlement: (1) our contract with the State of New York terminated effective December 15, 2017 and we were released from all liabilities and obligations in connection with the contract at such time; and (2) we will pay, or incur costs on behalf of, the State of New York in the amount of approximately $20 million. As we have previously reserved this amount, we will incur no additional charges as a result of the settlement.\nSignificant 2016 Actions\nSeparation\nOn December 31, 2016, Conduent Incorporated spun-off from Xerox Corporation, pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement. The separation was completed by way of a pro rata distribution of Conduent Incorporated shares held by Xerox to Xerox's shareholders. As a result of the spin-off we operate as an independent, publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \"CNDT\".\nGoodwill Impairment Charge\nOur Commercial Industries reporting units operating results declined in 2016 versus our expectations, including a weak fourth quarter 2016. In performing our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined that the carrying value of the Commercial Industries reporting unit exceeded its fair value by 53%, which resulted in a goodwill impairment of $935 million. This has been presented as Goodwill impairment, a separate line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). Refer to Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nHealth Enterprise Charge\nIn February 2017, we determined that it was not probable that the New York Medicaid Management Information System (NY MMIS) project would be completed. As a result of this determination, we recorded a pre-tax charge (NY MMIS charge) of $161 million ($98 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2016. The charge included $83 million for the write-off of contract receivables which were recorded as a reduction of revenue and $78 million recorded in Cost of services including $36 million for wind-down costs, $28 million related to the non-cash charge for the impairment of software and $14 million for the write-off of deferred contract set-up and transition costs and other related assets and liabilities.\nSignificant 2015 Actions\nHealth Enterprise Charge\nIn 2015, we determined that we would not fully complete the HE platform implementation projects in California and Montana. However, we would continue to process Medicaid claims using existing legacy systems in those states, thus providing uninterrupted service for the states' healthcare providers and constituents.\nAs a result of this determination, we recorded a pre-tax HE charge of $389 million ($237 million after-tax). The charge included $116 million for the write-off of contract receivables (primarily non-current), $34 million related to the non-cash impairment of the HE software and deferred contract set-up transition costs and $23 million for other related assets and liabilities. The remainder of the charge was primarily related to settlement costs including payments to subcontractors resulting in cash outflows in future periods. Of the $389 million charge, $116 million was recorded as a reduction to revenue and the remaining $273 million recorded to Cost of services.\nThis development resulted from the Government Healthcare strategy change announced in July 2015, regarding our decision to focus our future HE implementations on current Medicaid customers and to discontinue investment in and sales of our Integrated Eligibility System. This resulted in a pre-tax non-cash software platform impairment charge of $146 million ($89 million after-tax).\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 28\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements giving due consideration to materiality. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies, estimates and related disclosures included herein with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We consider these as critical to understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements, as their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, since financial reporting results rely on estimates of the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. In instances where different estimates could have reasonably been used, we disclose the impact of these different estimates on our operations. In certain instances, the accounting rules are prescriptive; therefore, it would not have been possible to reasonably use different estimates. Changes in assumptions and estimates are reflected in the period in which they occur. The impact of such changes could be material to our results of operations and financial condition in any quarterly or annual period.\nSpecific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are discussed throughout the MD&A, where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nApplication of the various accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies.\nA significant portion of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria that do not require significant estimates or uncertainties. For example, transaction volumes, time and material and cost reimbursable arrangements are based on specific, objective criteria under the contracts. Accordingly, revenues recognized under these contracts do not require the use of significant estimates that are susceptible to change. Revenue recognized using the percentage-of completion (POC) accounting method does require the use of estimates and judgment as discussed below.\nWe recognize revenues when we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the services have been provided, the transaction price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. During 2017, approximately 80% of our revenue was recognized based on transaction volumes, approximately 13% was recognized on a fixed fee basis (wherein our revenue is earned as we fulfill our performance obligations under the arrangement), approximately 1% was related to cost reimbursable contracts, approximately 2% recognized using POC accounting and the remaining 4% was related to time and material contracts. Our revenue mix is subject to change due to the impact of changing customer requirements, acquisitions, divestitures, new business and lost business.\nPercentage-of-Completion: The POC method requires the use of estimates and judgment. Although not significant to total revenue, the POC methodology is normally applied to certain of our larger and longer term outsourcing contracts involving system development and implementation, primarily in government healthcare and certain government transportation contracts. In addition, we had unbilled receivables totaling $187 million and $279 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing revenues recognized but not yet billable under the terms of our POC contracts.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 29\nThe POC accounting methodology involves recognizing probable and reasonably estimable revenue using the percentage of services completed based on a current cumulative cost incurred to estimated total cost basis and a reasonably consistent profit margin over the period. Due to the long-term nature of these arrangements, developing the estimates of cost often requires significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include, but are not limited to, the availability of labor and labor productivity, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and the impact of delayed performance. If changes occur in delivery, productivity or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenues, we revise our cost and revenue estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in revenues. Such revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision become known. We perform ongoing profitability analysis of our POC services contracts in order to determine whether the latest estimates require updating. Key factors reviewed by the Company to estimate the future costs to complete each contract are future labor costs, future product costs, expected productivity efficiencies, achievement of contracted milestones and performance goals, as well as potential penalties for milestone and system implementation delays.\nIf at any time our estimates indicate the POC contract will be unprofitable, the entire estimated loss for the remainder of the contract is recorded immediately in cost of services. This results in the contract being recorded at a zero profit margin going forward with recognition of an equal amount of revenues and costs over the remaining contract term. A zero profit margin may also be applied when it is impractical to estimate specific amounts or ranges of contract revenues and costs; however, we can at least determine that we will not incur a loss on a particular contract.\nCapitalization of Outsourcing Contract Costs\nIn connection with our services arrangements, we incur and capitalize costs to originate these long-term contracts and to perform the migration, transition and setup activities necessary to enable us to perform under the terms of the arrangement. Certain initial direct costs of an arrangement are capitalized and amortized over the contractual service period of the arrangement to cost of services. From time to time, we also provide inducements to customers in various forms, including contractual credits, which are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the contract. We regularly review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Key estimates and assumptions that we must make include projecting future cash flows in order to assess the recoverability of deferred costs. To assess recoverability, undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining life and compared to the carrying amount of contract related assets, including the unamortized deferred cost balance. Key factors that are considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include projected labor costs and productivity efficiencies. A significant change in an estimate or assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nCapitalization of Software Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed after establishing technological feasibility, and we capitalize costs to develop or purchase internal-use software. Significant estimates and assumptions include: determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on estimated useful lives, estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. For commercial software products, determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products. We consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues, including an assessment of alternative solutions or products, current and historical demand for the product, and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete. For internal-use software, the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of our ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis. To assess the recoverability of capitalized software costs, we consider estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows. Such estimates require assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows, and are primarily based on the historical experience and expectations regarding future revenues. A significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations.\nRefer to Note 5 - Land, Buildings, Equipment and Software, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding capitalized software costs.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 30\nHeld for Sale\nWe classify assets as held for sale in the period when the following conditions are met: (i) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the asset (disposal group); (ii) the asset (disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (disposal group); (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset (disposal group) have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the asset (disposal group) is probable, and transfer of the asset (disposal group) is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond our control extend the period of time required to sell the asset (disposal group) beyond one year; (v) the asset (disposal group) is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (vi) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\nA long-lived asset (disposal group) that is classified as held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a long-lived asset (disposal group) until the date of sale.\nThe fair value of a long-lived asset (disposal group) less any costs to sell is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and any subsequent changes are reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset (disposal group), as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the asset at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. Upon determining that a long-lived asset (disposal group) meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group in the line items Assets held for sale and Liabilities held for sale, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, management approved the disposal through sale of certain assets and businesses, which is a mix of both Commercial Industries and Public Sectors. This action was taken as a result of our evaluation of these businesses as they represent businesses in markets or with services that we did not see as strategic or core. As of December 31, 2017, these businesses qualified as assets held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we reclassified $757 million to assets held for sale and $169 million to liabilities held for sale, as we have an active program to locate buyers for these businesses and we expect these businesses to be sold within one year.\nIntangible Assets\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily estimated using an income approach. These estimates include market participant assumptions and require projected financial information, including assumptions about future revenue growth and costs necessary to facilitate the projected growth. Other key inputs include assumptions about technological obsolescence, customer attrition rates, brand recognition, the allocation of projected cash flows to identifiable intangible assets and discount rates. We regularly review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>significant negative industry or economic trends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> When we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of potential impairment, we assess whether an impairment has occurred based on whether net book value of the assets exceeds the related projected undiscounted cash flows from these assets. We consider a number of factors, including past operating results, budgets, economic projections, market trends and product development cycles in estimating future cash flows. Differing estimates and assumptions as to any of the factors described above could result in a materially different impairment charge, if any, and thus materially different results of operations.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if an event or circumstance indicates that impairment may have been incurred. Events or circumstances that might indicate an interim evaluation is warranted include, among other things, unexpected adverse business conditions, macro and reporting unit specific economic factors, supply costs, unanticipated competitive activities and acts by governments and courts.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 31\nApplication of the annual goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the assessment of the fair value of each reporting unit. We determined that our reporting units were the same as our operating segments and, therefore, our business is comprised of two reporting units. Our annual quantitative impairment test of goodwill was performed in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIn our quantitative test, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit by weighting the results from the income approach (discounted cash flow methodology) and market approach. These valuation approaches require significant judgment and consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. In addition, we are required to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the current economic environment, industry factors and the future profitability of our businesses.\nWhen performing our discounted cash flow analysis for each reporting unit, we incorporate the use of projected financial information and discount rates that are developed using market participant-based assumptions. The cash-flow projections are based on three-year financial forecasts developed by management that include revenue and expense projections, restructuring and strategic transformation activities, capital spending trends and investment in working capital to support anticipated revenue growth or other changes in the business. The selected discount rates consider the risk and nature of the respective reporting units' cash flows, appropriate capital structure and rates of return that market participants would require to invest their capital in our reporting units.\nWe believe these assumptions are appropriate and reflect our forecasted long-term business model and give appropriate consideration to our historical results as well as the current economic environment and markets that we serve.\nBased on our quantitative assessments, we concluded that the fair value of our Commercial Industries and Public Sector reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by 72% and 13%, respectively, at December 31, 2017. The most significant assumptions used in the goodwill analysis relate to a 3% long-term organic growth rate for both the Commercial Industries and Public Sector segments as well as a 9.25% and a 8.75% discount rate for the Commercial Industries and Public Sector segments, respectively. The fair values of the Commercial Industries and Public Sector segments are sensitive to changes in the long-term growth rates and the discount rates. A decrease of 50 basis points to the long-term growth rate or an increase to the discount rate of 50 basis points would result in an approximate reduction of fair value of $200 million and $250 million, respectively, in the Public Sector segment.\nRefer to Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding goodwill by reportable segment.\nRestructuring and Asset Impairments\nWe have engaged in restructuring actions, which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction, the fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the lease cancellation and other exit costs. We accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements.\nFor additional information regarding our restructuring actions, refer to the \"Restructuring and Related Costs\" section in the MD&A and Note 7 - Restructuring Programs and Asset Impairment Charges in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our provision is based on nonrecurring events as well as recurring factors, including the taxation of foreign income. In addition, our provision will change based on discrete or other nonrecurring events such as audit settlements, tax law changes, changes in valuation allowances and other factors, that may not be predictable. In the event that there is a significant unusual or one-time item recognized in our operating results, the taxes attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as an unusual or one-time item.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 32\nWe record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and provide valuation allowances as required. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Gross deferred tax assets of $250 million and $360 million had valuation allowances of $35 million and $24 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a result of the 2017 tax law changes in the United States, we recorded provisional amounts for a one-time non-cash $210 million income tax benefit related to adjusting our deferred tax liabilities from a 35% Federal tax rate to a 21% Federal tax rate and the transition tax expense of $12 million.\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. Accordingly, we may incur additional tax expense based upon our assessment of the more-likely-than-not outcomes of such matters. In addition, when applicable, we adjust previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results. Our ongoing assessments of the more-likely-than-not outcomes of examinations and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax rate, as well as impact our operating results. Unrecognized tax benefits were $15 million, $14 million and $24 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nRefer to Note 12 - Income Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding deferred income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure considering all available information including, but not limited to, the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular matter. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation, and may revise estimates. These revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on the results of operations and financial position.\nRefer to Note 13 - Contingencies and Litigation in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding loss contingencies.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 33\nFinancial Information\nFinancial information for the three years ended December 31, 2017 was as follows:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

strategic decisions by management as part of our portfolio rationalization, including exiting certain unprofitable contracts, the run-off of our Student Loan business and contract losses. Partially offsetting these declines was an increase from the ramping of new business.\nTotal revenues for 2016 decreased compared to the prior year as a result of the NY MMIS charge of $83 million, lower volumes, delayed ramping of new business and contract exits, primarily in customer care contracts within our Commercial Industries segment, the run off of our Student Loan business and overall price declines that were consistent with prior-period trends. Partially offsetting these declines were new contracts in the Public Sector.\nCost of Services\nCost of services for 2017 decreased compared to the prior year period primarily due to cost transformation, lost business, wind-down of the NY MMIS contract, run-off of our Student Loan business, strategic contract actions taken by management as part of portfolio management and lower volumes.\nCost of services for 2016 decreased compared to the prior year period primarily due to lost business, the NY MMIS contract, run-off of our Student Loan business and lower volumes.\nGross Margin\nIncrease in gross margin in 2017 compared to the prior year period was driven primarily by the impact of cost and productivity improvements, including benefits from our strategic transformation program, exiting or remediating certain underperforming contracts and lower costs associated with our Student Loan business. This was partially offset by the run-off of our Student Loan business, contract losses and lower volumes with existing clients.\nIncrease in gross margin in 2016 compared to the prior year period reflected cost benefits from our strategic transformation initiatives offset by lost business and margin pressures in our customer service offerings and price declines.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 34\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A)\nLower SG&A compared to the prior years reflected the impact of our strategic transformation initiatives driving lower wages and benefits, partially offset by the expansion and investment in our sales force.\nRestructuring and Related Costs\nRestructuring and related costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 include $46 million of lease cancellation costs as part of our effort to consolidate our real estate footprint, $41 million of severance costs due to headcount reductions of approximately 3,200 employees worldwide, $9 million of costs primarily related to professional support services associated with the implementation of the strategic transformation program and $5 million of asset impairments charges.\nRestructuring and related costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 include $54 million of severance costs due to headcount reductions of approximately 3,600 employees worldwide, $28 million of costs primarily related to professional support services associated with the implementation of the strategic transformation program, $12 million of asset impairment charges and $7 million of lease cancellation costs.\nRefer to Note 7 - Restructuring Programs and Asset Impairment Charges in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring programs.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible asset decreased in 2017 from the prior year primarily due to the acceleration of amortization of certain trade-names in 2016.\nAmortization of intangible assets was higher in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to the acceleration of amortization of certain trade-names associated with prior acquisitions.\nRefer to Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our intangible assets.\nGoodwill Impairment\nOur Commercial Industries reporting unit experienced declining operating results in 2016 versus expectations. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $935 million. Refer to Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Goodwill impairment charge.\nSeparation Costs\nSeparation costs are primarily for third-party investment banking, accounting, legal, consulting and other similar types of services related to the separation transaction as well as costs associated with the operational separation of the two companies, such as those related to human resources, brand management, real estate and information management to the extent not capitalized. Separation costs also include the costs associated with bonuses and restricted stock grants awarded to employees for retention through the separation.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense represents interest on long-term debt and the amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased compared to the prior year, primarily due to the issuance of debt with the capitalization of the Company during the spin-off in December 2016 and subsequent borrowing under Term Loan B in January 2017, as well as amounts outstanding at various times throughout the year under the Company's credit facility.\nIn 2017, the Company successfully repriced its Term Loan B in April and October (Amendments No.1 and No. 2, respectively), which overall resulted in lowering the total interest rate on this loan by 250 basis points to LIBOR plus 3.0%.\nRefer to Note 8 - Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 35\nRelated Party Interest\nIn January 2017, in connection with the spin-off from Xerox Corporation, we paid Xerox $161 million for the final settlement per the Separation and Distribution Agreement.\nRelated-party interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was lower than the prior year primarily due to the payment of certain related party notes payable in 2015, as a result of the proceeds received from the sale of the ITO business.\nRefer to Note 18 - Related Party Transactions and Former Parent Company Investment in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n(Gain) Loss on Sale of Asset\nAs disclosed under Item 7. MD&A- Divestiture, we completed five divestitures in 2017 with aggregate proceeds of $56 million. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $16 million on these divestitures. In addition, in 2017 we sold a property located in Dallas, TX, which was formerly the ACS headquarters, for a pre-tax gain of $24 million.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nOther (income) expense, net primarily includes foreign currency transaction losses (gains), litigation and other contingent matters and deferred compensation investment results.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) was enacted. The effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. In the case of US federal income taxes, the enactment date is the date the bill becomes law. The income tax effects of the Tax Reform have been initially accounted for on a provisional basis pursuant to the SEC staff guidance on income taxes. Reasonable estimates for all material tax effects of the Tax Reform have been provided and adjustments to provisional amounts will be made in subsequent reporting periods as information becomes available to complete provisional computations.\nThe 2017 effective tax rate was 1,206.3% as compared with 19.9% for the prior year. The 2017 rate was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of the Tax Reform, which included the reduction of the U.S. statutory rate from 35% to 21% and a one-time tax on undistributed and previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits. Excluding primarily the tax impact of the Tax Reform, the termination of the COLI, amortization of intangible assets and gains on U.S divestitures, the adjusted effective tax rate for 2017 was 33.8%. The Tax Reform is the most significant change to U.S. federal income tax legislation in over 30 years and, as a result, has a disproportionate effect on our 2017 effective tax rate. See Note 12 - Income Taxes for further information regarding the impact of the Tax Reform on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using the enacted tax rates for the periods during which the related temporary differences are expected to reverse or deferred tax attributes are expected to be realized. As a result of the change in future federal statutory tax rate due to the passing of the Tax Reform, the deferred tax assets and liabilities should no longer be valued at a federal statutory rate of 35%, but rather at the rate in which the benefit of the deferred tax liabilities will be realized by the Company. As such, the U.S. federal statutory rate used to value the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities was 21%, which resulted in a $210 million tax benefit.\nThe 2016 effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate due primarily to the impact of the non-deductible Goodwill impairment charge. Excluding primarily the goodwill impairment, NY MMIS, amortization of intangible assets, and restructuring costs, the 2016 normalized effective rate was 29.0%.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 36\nOperations Review of Segments\nOur reportable segments correspond to how we organize and manage the business and are aligned to the industries in which our clients operate. Beginning in 2017, in an effort to better reflect how we organize and manage our business, we changed our reporting segments to align the Healthcare business based on customer focus between Commercial Industries and Public Sector. All prior years have been adjusted to reflect the new reporting segments.\nThe following are our results of financial performance by segment for the three years ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 57:

Segment\nRevenue\nCommercial Industries revenue 2017 as compared to prior year decreased, primarily driven by strategic contract actions, lower volumes in our customer care offerings and lost business, partially offset by revenue from new contracts and price increases with existing clients. Commercial Industries revenue for 2016 decreased from the prior year, mainly driven by lost business, lower volumes in our customer care offerings and reduced level of project work as a result of fewer large cases in our litigation services offering, negative impacts from currency and strategic contract exits. Partially offsetting the decline were new contract signings, primarily in our high-tech business area.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 37\nSegment Profit\nIncrease in the Commercial Industries segment profit for 2017 as compared to the prior year, was primarily driven by reduced costs as a result of our strategic transformation initiatives, including contract remediation and strategic contract actions, partially offset by the overall revenue decline. The Commercial Industries segment profit for 2016 as compared to the prior year was largely flat, primarily due to overall benefits from costs and productivity initiatives, partially offset by margin pressure in our customer care services offering and reduced project work in our litigation services offering.\nPublic Sector Segment\nRevenue\nPublic Sector revenue for 2017 as compared to prior year decreased, primarily driven by strategic decisions and contract losses in State & Local, Government Healthcare and Payment Services. Public Sector revenue for 2016 decreased as compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower volumes and lost business in State Government Services, partially offset by new business.\nSegment Profit\nDecrease in the Public Sector segment profit for 2017 as compared to the prior year was mainly due to strategic decisions, contract losses in Government Healthcare, as well as losses in our Payment Services business, partially mitigated by our strategic transformation initiative. Decrease in the Public Sector segment profit for 2016 as compared to prior year was primarily due to the impact of lost business in State Government Services, partially offset by costs and productivity initiatives and improved performance in our transportation offering.\nOther\nRevenue\nOther revenue for 2017 improved compared to 2016, primarily due to improved pricing and performance from two large Health Enterprise clients, partially offset by the exit from the NY MMIS contract and the strategic run-off of the Student Loan business. Other revenue for 2016 increased compared to 2015 as a result of the non-recurring $116 million HE charge in 2015, partially offset by the $83 million write-off of NY MMIS in 2016, the continued run-off of the Student Loan business, partially offset by our prior-year decision to not complete the HE implementations in California and Montana.\nSegment Loss\nOther loss for 2017 improved, primarily due to improved profitability in the student loan business, improved pricing from a contract extension with a large Health Enterprise client and general operational efficiencies in the HE business. Other loss for 2016 improved as a result of the non-recurring $389 million HE charge in 2015, partially offset by the $161 million write-off of the NY MMIS, partially offset by improvements in HE platform implementation expenses resulting from the decision to not fully complete the HE platform implementation in California and Montana.\nMetrics\nSignings\nSignings are defined as estimated future revenues from contracts signed during the period, including renewals of existing contracts. Total Contract Value (TCV) is the estimated total contractual revenue related to signed contracts. The amounts in the following table do not reflect the impact of our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard on January 1, 2018.

Partially offsetting these declines were new business wins in targeted offerings and expansion with certain existing clients.\nSignings for 2016 decreased compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting lower contribution from new business, due in part to our decision not to pursue opportunities with lower margins and the prior year large NY MMIS new business signing.\nRenewal Rate\nRenewal rate is defined as the annual recurring revenue (ARR) on contracts that are renewed during the period as a percentage of ARR on all contracts for which a renewal decision was made during the period, excluding any contracts that were not renewed and where a strategic action to improve the risk or profitability had been initiated.\nExcluding our strategic decision not to renew certain contracts, renewal rate for 2017 was 94% and above our target range of 85%-90%. Including all contracts, renewals would have been 87%.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, total cash and cash equivalents were $658 million and $390 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, there were $1,574 million outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and we utilized $12 million of our revolving credit facility capacity to issue letters of credit. In addition, we will make payments in 2018 of $99 million to participants of the terminated deferred compensation plans.\nRefer to the Capital Market Activity section below for additional information regarding our capital activity.\nCash Flow Analysis\nThe following summarizes our cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2017, as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(385\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(506\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>(109\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,023\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(241\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe increase in cash generated from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to improvements in working capital and reduced wind-down payments associated with implementations in California, Montana and New York, partially offset by a higher interest payments on our outstanding debt.\nThe decrease in cash generated from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to reduced factoring, HE settlement payments and working capital partially offset by lower net income tax payments due to income tax refunds.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 39\nInvesting Activities\nThe increase in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily related to $117 million in proceeds received on the liquidation of investments related to the termination of the deferred compensation plan, $56 million of proceeds from the sale of business and assets as compared to payments of $54 million in 2016, $86 million of lower net additions to land, buildings and equipment, partially offset by non-recurring proceeds of $248 million on related party notes receivable in 2016.\nThe decrease in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily related to $54 million of payments for the sale of business and assets as compared to proceeds of $742 million in 2015, partially offset by proceeds of $248 million from related party notes receivable in 2016.\nFinancing Activities\nThe change to cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to cash provided by for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily related to a decrease of $1.7 billion in proceeds from long term debt and an increase in debt payments of $209 million, partially offset by a reduction in payments to former parent of $1.6 billion.\nThe change to cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to cash used for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily related to an increase of $1.9 billion in proceeds from long term debt and a reduction in payments on debt of $261 million, partially offset by an increase in payments to former parent of $957 million.\nCapital Market Activity\nIn April 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement, which reduced the interest rate on our Term Loan B by 1.5% from 5.5% over LIBOR to 4.0% over LIBOR. Subsequently in October 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 2, which reduced the interest rate on our Term Loan B by 1.0% from 4.0% over LIBOR to 3.0% over LIBOR.\nIn January 2017, we borrowed an additional $100 million on Term Loan B with proceeds used for general corporate purposes.\nRefer to Note 8 - Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFinancial Instruments\nRefer to Note 9 - Financial Instruments in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nContractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies\nAt December 31, 2017, we had the following contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt, including capital lease obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on debt(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum operating lease commitments(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Defined benefit pension plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated Purchase Commitments(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Total debt represents principal debt and capital leases.

Our 2017 cash contributions for these plans were $8 million. In 2018, based on current actuarial calculations, we expect to make contributions of approximately $8 million to our worldwide defined benefit pension plans.\nContributions to our defined benefit pension plans in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors, including the investment performance of plan assets and discount rates as well as potential legislative and plan changes. At December 31, 2017, the unfunded and underfunded balances of our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $40 million and $19 million, respectively.\nRefer to Note 11 - Employee Benefit Plans in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding contributions to our defined benefit pension and post-retirement plans.\nOther Contingencies and Commitments\nAs more fully discussed in Note 13 - Contingencies and Litigation in the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning: securities law; governmental entity contracting, servicing and procurement law; intellectual property law; environmental law; employment law; the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA); and other laws and regulations. In addition, guarantees, indemnifications and claims may arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with suppliers, customers and non-consolidated affiliates. Nonperformance under a contract including a guarantee, indemnification or claim could trigger an obligation of the Company.\nWe determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. Should developments in any of these areas cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, we do not believe we have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nIn addition, refer to the preceding table for the Company's contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and Note 13 - Contingencies and Litigation in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding contingencies, guarantees, indemnifications and warranty liabilities.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have reported our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, we have discussed our results using the non-GAAP measures described below.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 41\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results. Accordingly, we believe it is necessary to adjust several reported amounts, determined in accordance with GAAP, to exclude the effects of certain items as well as their related tax effects. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the current periods' results against the corresponding prior periods' results. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable U.S. GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions and providing such non-GAAP financial measures to investors allows for a further level of transparency as the factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures.\nA reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP are provided in the tables below.\nThese reconciliations also include the income tax effects of our non-GAAP performance measures in total, to the extent applicable. The income tax effects are calculated under the same accounting principles as applied to our reported pre-tax performance measures under ASC 740, which employs an annual effective tax rate method. The income tax effect for our non-GAAP performance measures is effectively the difference in income taxes for reported and adjusted pre-tax income calculated under the annual effective tax rate method. The tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments was calculated based upon evaluation of the statutory tax treatment and the applicable statutory tax rate in the jurisdictions in which such charges were incurred.\nAdjusted Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin*\nWe make adjustments to Revenue and Pre-tax income (Loss) for the following items for the purpose of calculating Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin.\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Goodwill Impairment.

In 2017, 12% of our revenue was generated outside the U.S.\nOur reportable segments correspond to how we organize and manage the business and are aligned to the industries in which our clients operate.\nBeginning in 2017, in an effort to better reflect how we manage our business, we changed our reporting segments to align the Healthcare business based upon customer focus between Commercial Industries and Public Sector.\n \u2022 Commercial Industries - Our Commercial Industries segment provides business process services and customized solutions to clients in a variety of industries. Across the Commercial Industries segment, we deliver end-to-end business-to-business and business-to-customer services that enable our clients to optimize their key processes. Our multi-industry competencies include transaction processing, customer experience, human resource management, omni-channel communications and finance and accounting services. \n \u2022 Public Sector - Our Public Sector segment provides government-centric business process services to U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments for transportation, public assistance, program administration, transaction processing and payment services.  Other includes our Government HE Medicaid Platform business, where we are limiting our focus to maintaining systems for our current clients; our Education Business inclusive of our Student Loan business, which is in runoff; and inter-segment eliminations.\nSignificant 2017 Actions\nDispositions\nIn 2017, we completed divestitures of: (1) our Firehouse business and suite of emergency records management products used by fire departments across the country for their incident reporting and Emergency Management System information and records management; (2) our healthcare provider consulting services business, which advises healthcare organizations on IT application optimization; (3) the Breakaway Group business, which provides advisory project services to assist healthcare organizations optimize their health IT applications; (4) the mobile device management business of Wireless Data Services Limited; and (5) the Global Mobility business. The aggregate proceeds for these divestitures was $56 million in cash. The businesses sold represent $60 million and $82 million of 2017 and 2016 revenue, respectively. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $16 million on these divestitures for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 27\nIn addition, in 2017, we sold a property located in Dallas, Texas, which was formerly the Affiliated Computer Services (ACS) headquarters, for a pre-tax gain of $24 million. This was part of our effort to consolidate our real estate footprint.\nHealth Enterprise Settlement\nOn November 28, 2017, we entered into a definitive settlement agreement with the State of New York regarding resolution of the HE platform project. Under the terms of the settlement: (1) our contract with the State of New York terminated effective December 15, 2017 and we were released from all liabilities and obligations in connection with the contract at such time; and (2) we will pay, or incur costs on behalf of, the State of New York in the amount of approximately $20 million. As we have previously reserved this amount, we will incur no additional charges as a result of the settlement.\nSignificant 2016 Actions\nSeparation\nOn December 31, 2016, Conduent Incorporated spun-off from Xerox Corporation, pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement. The separation was completed by way of a pro rata distribution of Conduent Incorporated shares held by Xerox to Xerox's shareholders. As a result of the spin-off we operate as an independent, publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \"CNDT\".\nGoodwill Impairment Charge\nOur Commercial Industries reporting units operating results declined in 2016 versus our expectations, including a weak fourth quarter 2016. In performing our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined that the carrying value of the Commercial Industries reporting unit exceeded its fair value by 53%, which resulted in a goodwill impairment of $935 million. This has been presented as Goodwill impairment, a separate line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). Refer to Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nHealth Enterprise Charge\nIn February 2017, we determined that it was not probable that the New York Medicaid Management Information System (NY MMIS) project would be completed. As a result of this determination, we recorded a pre-tax charge (NY MMIS charge) of $161 million ($98 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2016. The charge included $83 million for the write-off of contract receivables which were recorded as a reduction of revenue and $78 million recorded in Cost of services including $36 million for wind-down costs, $28 million related to the non-cash charge for the impairment of software and $14 million for the write-off of deferred contract set-up and transition costs and other related assets and liabilities.\nSignificant 2015 Actions\nHealth Enterprise Charge\nIn 2015, we determined that we would not fully complete the HE platform implementation projects in California and Montana. However, we would continue to process Medicaid claims using existing legacy systems in those states, thus providing uninterrupted service for the states' healthcare providers and constituents.\nAs a result of this determination, we recorded a pre-tax HE charge of $389 million ($237 million after-tax). The charge included $116 million for the write-off of contract receivables (primarily non-current), $34 million related to the non-cash impairment of the HE software and deferred contract set-up transition costs and $23 million for other related assets and liabilities. The remainder of the charge was primarily related to settlement costs including payments to subcontractors resulting in cash outflows in future periods. Of the $389 million charge, $116 million was recorded as a reduction to revenue and the remaining $273 million recorded to Cost of services.\nThis development resulted from the Government Healthcare strategy change announced in July 2015, regarding our decision to focus our future HE implementations on current Medicaid customers and to discontinue investment in and sales of our Integrated Eligibility System. This resulted in a pre-tax non-cash software platform impairment charge of $146 million ($89 million after-tax).\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 28\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements giving due consideration to materiality. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies, estimates and related disclosures included herein with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We consider these as critical to understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements, as their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, since financial reporting results rely on estimates of the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. In instances where different estimates could have reasonably been used, we disclose the impact of these different estimates on our operations. In certain instances, the accounting rules are prescriptive; therefore, it would not have been possible to reasonably use different estimates. Changes in assumptions and estimates are reflected in the period in which they occur. The impact of such changes could be material to our results of operations and financial condition in any quarterly or annual period.\nSpecific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are discussed throughout the MD&A, where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nApplication of the various accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies.\nA significant portion of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria that do not require significant estimates or uncertainties. For example, transaction volumes, time and material and cost reimbursable arrangements are based on specific, objective criteria under the contracts. Accordingly, revenues recognized under these contracts do not require the use of significant estimates that are susceptible to change. Revenue recognized using the percentage-of completion (POC) accounting method does require the use of estimates and judgment as discussed below.\nWe recognize revenues when we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the services have been provided, the transaction price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. During 2017, approximately 80% of our revenue was recognized based on transaction volumes, approximately 13% was recognized on a fixed fee basis (wherein our revenue is earned as we fulfill our performance obligations under the arrangement), approximately 1% was related to cost reimbursable contracts, approximately 2% recognized using POC accounting and the remaining 4% was related to time and material contracts. Our revenue mix is subject to change due to the impact of changing customer requirements, acquisitions, divestitures, new business and lost business.\nPercentage-of-Completion: The POC method requires the use of estimates and judgment. Although not significant to total revenue, the POC methodology is normally applied to certain of our larger and longer term outsourcing contracts involving system development and implementation, primarily in government healthcare and certain government transportation contracts. In addition, we had unbilled receivables totaling $187 million and $279 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing revenues recognized but not yet billable under the terms of our POC contracts.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 29\nThe POC accounting methodology involves recognizing probable and reasonably estimable revenue using the percentage of services completed based on a current cumulative cost incurred to estimated total cost basis and a reasonably consistent profit margin over the period. Due to the long-term nature of these arrangements, developing the estimates of cost often requires significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include, but are not limited to, the availability of labor and labor productivity, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and the impact of delayed performance. If changes occur in delivery, productivity or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenues, we revise our cost and revenue estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in revenues. Such revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision become known. We perform ongoing profitability analysis of our POC services contracts in order to determine whether the latest estimates require updating. Key factors reviewed by the Company to estimate the future costs to complete each contract are future labor costs, future product costs, expected productivity efficiencies, achievement of contracted milestones and performance goals, as well as potential penalties for milestone and system implementation delays.\nIf at any time our estimates indicate the POC contract will be unprofitable, the entire estimated loss for the remainder of the contract is recorded immediately in cost of services. This results in the contract being recorded at a zero profit margin going forward with recognition of an equal amount of revenues and costs over the remaining contract term. A zero profit margin may also be applied when it is impractical to estimate specific amounts or ranges of contract revenues and costs; however, we can at least determine that we will not incur a loss on a particular contract.\nCapitalization of Outsourcing Contract Costs\nIn connection with our services arrangements, we incur and capitalize costs to originate these long-term contracts and to perform the migration, transition and setup activities necessary to enable us to perform under the terms of the arrangement. Certain initial direct costs of an arrangement are capitalized and amortized over the contractual service period of the arrangement to cost of services. From time to time, we also provide inducements to customers in various forms, including contractual credits, which are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the contract. We regularly review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Key estimates and assumptions that we must make include projecting future cash flows in order to assess the recoverability of deferred costs. To assess recoverability, undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining life and compared to the carrying amount of contract related assets, including the unamortized deferred cost balance. Key factors that are considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include projected labor costs and productivity efficiencies. A significant change in an estimate or assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nCapitalization of Software Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed after establishing technological feasibility, and we capitalize costs to develop or purchase internal-use software. Significant estimates and assumptions include: determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on estimated useful lives, estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. For commercial software products, determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products. We consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues, including an assessment of alternative solutions or products, current and historical demand for the product, and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete. For internal-use software, the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of our ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis. To assess the recoverability of capitalized software costs, we consider estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows. Such estimates require assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows, and are primarily based on the historical experience and expectations regarding future revenues. A significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations.\nRefer to Note 5 - Land, Buildings, Equipment and Software, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding capitalized software costs.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 30\nHeld for Sale\nWe classify assets as held for sale in the period when the following conditions are met: (i) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the asset (disposal group); (ii) the asset (disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (disposal group); (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset (disposal group) have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the asset (disposal group) is probable, and transfer of the asset (disposal group) is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond our control extend the period of time required to sell the asset (disposal group) beyond one year; (v) the asset (disposal group) is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (vi) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\nA long-lived asset (disposal group) that is classified as held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a long-lived asset (disposal group) until the date of sale.\nThe fair value of a long-lived asset (disposal group) less any costs to sell is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and any subsequent changes are reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset (disposal group), as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the asset at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. Upon determining that a long-lived asset (disposal group) meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group in the line items Assets held for sale and Liabilities held for sale, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, management approved the disposal through sale of certain assets and businesses, which is a mix of both Commercial Industries and Public Sectors. This action was taken as a result of our evaluation of these businesses as they represent businesses in markets or with services that we did not see as strategic or core. As of December 31, 2017, these businesses qualified as assets held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we reclassified $757 million to assets held for sale and $169 million to liabilities held for sale, as we have an active program to locate buyers for these businesses and we expect these businesses to be sold within one year.\nIntangible Assets\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily estimated using an income approach. These estimates include market participant assumptions and require projected financial information, including assumptions about future revenue growth and costs necessary to facilitate the projected growth. Other key inputs include assumptions about technological obsolescence, customer attrition rates, brand recognition, the allocation of projected cash flows to identifiable intangible assets and discount rates. We regularly review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following:\n \u2022 significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; \n \u2022 significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; and \n \u2022 significant negative industry or economic trends.  When we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of potential impairment, we assess whether an impairment has occurred based on whether net book value of the assets exceeds the related projected undiscounted cash flows from these assets. We consider a number of factors, including past operating results, budgets, economic projections, market trends and product development cycles in estimating future cash flows. Differing estimates and assumptions as to any of the factors described above could result in a materially different impairment charge, if any, and thus materially different results of operations.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if an event or circumstance indicates that impairment may have been incurred. Events or circumstances that might indicate an interim evaluation is warranted include, among other things, unexpected adverse business conditions, macro and reporting unit specific economic factors, supply costs, unanticipated competitive activities and acts by governments and courts.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 31\nApplication of the annual goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the assessment of the fair value of each reporting unit. We determined that our reporting units were the same as our operating segments and, therefore, our business is comprised of two reporting units. Our annual quantitative impairment test of goodwill was performed in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIn our quantitative test, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit by weighting the results from the income approach (discounted cash flow methodology) and market approach. These valuation approaches require significant judgment and consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. In addition, we are required to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the current economic environment, industry factors and the future profitability of our businesses.\nWhen performing our discounted cash flow analysis for each reporting unit, we incorporate the use of projected financial information and discount rates that are developed using market participant-based assumptions. The cash-flow projections are based on three-year financial forecasts developed by management that include revenue and expense projections, restructuring and strategic transformation activities, capital spending trends and investment in working capital to support anticipated revenue growth or other changes in the business. The selected discount rates consider the risk and nature of the respective reporting units' cash flows, appropriate capital structure and rates of return that market participants would require to invest their capital in our reporting units.\nWe believe these assumptions are appropriate and reflect our forecasted long-term business model and give appropriate consideration to our historical results as well as the current economic environment and markets that we serve.\nBased on our quantitative assessments, we concluded that the fair value of our Commercial Industries and Public Sector reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by 72% and 13%, respectively, at December 31, 2017. The most significant assumptions used in the goodwill analysis relate to a 3% long-term organic growth rate for both the Commercial Industries and Public Sector segments as well as a 9.25% and a 8.75% discount rate for the Commercial Industries and Public Sector segments, respectively. The fair values of the Commercial Industries and Public Sector segments are sensitive to changes in the long-term growth rates and the discount rates. A decrease of 50 basis points to the long-term growth rate or an increase to the discount rate of 50 basis points would result in an approximate reduction of fair value of $200 million and $250 million, respectively, in the Public Sector segment.\nRefer to Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding goodwill by reportable segment.\nRestructuring and Asset Impairments\nWe have engaged in restructuring actions, which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction, the fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the lease cancellation and other exit costs. We accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements.\nFor additional information regarding our restructuring actions, refer to the \"Restructuring and Related Costs\" section in the MD&A and Note 7 - Restructuring Programs and Asset Impairment Charges in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our provision is based on nonrecurring events as well as recurring factors, including the taxation of foreign income. In addition, our provision will change based on discrete or other nonrecurring events such as audit settlements, tax law changes, changes in valuation allowances and other factors, that may not be predictable. In the event that there is a significant unusual or one-time item recognized in our operating results, the taxes attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as an unusual or one-time item.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 32\nWe record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and provide valuation allowances as required. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Gross deferred tax assets of $250 million and $360 million had valuation allowances of $35 million and $24 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a result of the 2017 tax law changes in the United States, we recorded provisional amounts for a one-time non-cash $210 million income tax benefit related to adjusting our deferred tax liabilities from a 35% Federal tax rate to a 21% Federal tax rate and the transition tax expense of $12 million.\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. Accordingly, we may incur additional tax expense based upon our assessment of the more-likely-than-not outcomes of such matters. In addition, when applicable, we adjust previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results. Our ongoing assessments of the more-likely-than-not outcomes of examinations and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax rate, as well as impact our operating results. Unrecognized tax benefits were $15 million, $14 million and $24 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nRefer to Note 12 - Income Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding deferred income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure considering all available information including, but not limited to, the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular matter. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation, and may revise estimates. These revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on the results of operations and financial position.\nRefer to Note 13 - Contingencies and Litigation in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding loss contingencies.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 33\nFinancial Information\nFinancial information for the three years ended December 31, 2017 was as follows:\n\nRevenue\nTotal revenues for 2017 decreased mainly due to the impact from strategic decisions by management as part of our portfolio rationalization, including exiting certain unprofitable contracts, the run-off of our Student Loan business and contract losses. Partially offsetting these declines was an increase from the ramping of new business.\nTotal revenues for 2016 decreased compared to the prior year as a result of the NY MMIS charge of $83 million, lower volumes, delayed ramping of new business and contract exits, primarily in customer care contracts within our Commercial Industries segment, the run off of our Student Loan business and overall price declines that were consistent with prior-period trends. Partially offsetting these declines were new contracts in the Public Sector.\nCost of Services\nCost of services for 2017 decreased compared to the prior year period primarily due to cost transformation, lost business, wind-down of the NY MMIS contract, run-off of our Student Loan business, strategic contract actions taken by management as part of portfolio management and lower volumes.\nCost of services for 2016 decreased compared to the prior year period primarily due to lost business, the NY MMIS contract, run-off of our Student Loan business and lower volumes.\nGross Margin\nIncrease in gross margin in 2017 compared to the prior year period was driven primarily by the impact of cost and productivity improvements, including benefits from our strategic transformation program, exiting or remediating certain underperforming contracts and lower costs associated with our Student Loan business. This was partially offset by the run-off of our Student Loan business, contract losses and lower volumes with existing clients.\nIncrease in gross margin in 2016 compared to the prior year period reflected cost benefits from our strategic transformation initiatives offset by lost business and margin pressures in our customer service offerings and price declines.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 34\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A)\nLower SG&A compared to the prior years reflected the impact of our strategic transformation initiatives driving lower wages and benefits, partially offset by the expansion and investment in our sales force.\nRestructuring and Related Costs\nRestructuring and related costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 include $46 million of lease cancellation costs as part of our effort to consolidate our real estate footprint, $41 million of severance costs due to headcount reductions of approximately 3,200 employees worldwide, $9 million of costs primarily related to professional support services associated with the implementation of the strategic transformation program and $5 million of asset impairments charges.\nRestructuring and related costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 include $54 million of severance costs due to headcount reductions of approximately 3,600 employees worldwide, $28 million of costs primarily related to professional support services associated with the implementation of the strategic transformation program, $12 million of asset impairment charges and $7 million of lease cancellation costs.\nRefer to Note 7 - Restructuring Programs and Asset Impairment Charges in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring programs.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible asset decreased in 2017 from the prior year primarily due to the acceleration of amortization of certain trade-names in 2016.\nAmortization of intangible assets was higher in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to the acceleration of amortization of certain trade-names associated with prior acquisitions.\nRefer to Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our intangible assets.\nGoodwill Impairment\nOur Commercial Industries reporting unit experienced declining operating results in 2016 versus expectations. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $935 million. Refer to Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Goodwill impairment charge.\nSeparation Costs\nSeparation costs are primarily for third-party investment banking, accounting, legal, consulting and other similar types of services related to the separation transaction as well as costs associated with the operational separation of the two companies, such as those related to human resources, brand management, real estate and information management to the extent not capitalized. Separation costs also include the costs associated with bonuses and restricted stock grants awarded to employees for retention through the separation.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense represents interest on long-term debt and the amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased compared to the prior year, primarily due to the issuance of debt with the capitalization of the Company during the spin-off in December 2016 and subsequent borrowing under Term Loan B in January 2017, as well as amounts outstanding at various times throughout the year under the Company's credit facility.\nIn 2017, the Company successfully repriced its Term Loan B in April and October (Amendments No.1 and No. 2, respectively), which overall resulted in lowering the total interest rate on this loan by 250 basis points to LIBOR plus 3.0%.\nRefer to Note 8 - Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 35\nRelated Party Interest\nIn January 2017, in connection with the spin-off from Xerox Corporation, we paid Xerox $161 million for the final settlement per the Separation and Distribution Agreement.\nRelated-party interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was lower than the prior year primarily due to the payment of certain related party notes payable in 2015, as a result of the proceeds received from the sale of the ITO business.\nRefer to Note 18 - Related Party Transactions and Former Parent Company Investment in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n(Gain) Loss on Sale of Asset\nAs disclosed under Item 7. MD&A- Divestiture, we completed five divestitures in 2017 with aggregate proceeds of $56 million. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $16 million on these divestitures. In addition, in 2017 we sold a property located in Dallas, TX, which was formerly the ACS headquarters, for a pre-tax gain of $24 million.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nOther (income) expense, net primarily includes foreign currency transaction losses (gains), litigation and other contingent matters and deferred compensation investment results.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) was enacted. The effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. In the case of US federal income taxes, the enactment date is the date the bill becomes law. The income tax effects of the Tax Reform have been initially accounted for on a provisional basis pursuant to the SEC staff guidance on income taxes. Reasonable estimates for all material tax effects of the Tax Reform have been provided and adjustments to provisional amounts will be made in subsequent reporting periods as information becomes available to complete provisional computations.\nThe 2017 effective tax rate was 1,206.3% as compared with 19.9% for the prior year. The 2017 rate was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of the Tax Reform, which included the reduction of the U.S. statutory rate from 35% to 21% and a one-time tax on undistributed and previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits. Excluding primarily the tax impact of the Tax Reform, the termination of the COLI, amortization of intangible assets and gains on U.S divestitures, the adjusted effective tax rate for 2017 was 33.8%. The Tax Reform is the most significant change to U.S. federal income tax legislation in over 30 years and, as a result, has a disproportionate effect on our 2017 effective tax rate. See Note 12 - Income Taxes for further information regarding the impact of the Tax Reform on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using the enacted tax rates for the periods during which the related temporary differences are expected to reverse or deferred tax attributes are expected to be realized. As a result of the change in future federal statutory tax rate due to the passing of the Tax Reform, the deferred tax assets and liabilities should no longer be valued at a federal statutory rate of 35%, but rather at the rate in which the benefit of the deferred tax liabilities will be realized by the Company. As such, the U.S. federal statutory rate used to value the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities was 21%, which resulted in a $210 million tax benefit.\nThe 2016 effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate due primarily to the impact of the non-deductible Goodwill impairment charge. Excluding primarily the goodwill impairment, NY MMIS, amortization of intangible assets, and restructuring costs, the 2016 normalized effective rate was 29.0%.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 36\nOperations Review of Segments\nOur reportable segments correspond to how we organize and manage the business and are aligned to the industries in which our clients operate. Beginning in 2017, in an effort to better reflect how we organize and manage our business, we changed our reporting segments to align the Healthcare business based on customer focus between Commercial Industries and Public Sector. All prior years have been adjusted to reflect the new reporting segments.\nThe following are our results of financial performance by segment for the three years ended December 31, 2017:\n\n_______________\n (1) Refer to the reconciliations table in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section. \nCommercial Industries Segment\nRevenue\nCommercial Industries revenue 2017 as compared to prior year decreased, primarily driven by strategic contract actions, lower volumes in our customer care offerings and lost business, partially offset by revenue from new contracts and price increases with existing clients. Commercial Industries revenue for 2016 decreased from the prior year, mainly driven by lost business, lower volumes in our customer care offerings and reduced level of project work as a result of fewer large cases in our litigation services offering, negative impacts from currency and strategic contract exits. Partially offsetting the decline were new contract signings, primarily in our high-tech business area.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 37\nSegment Profit\nIncrease in the Commercial Industries segment profit for 2017 as compared to the prior year, was primarily driven by reduced costs as a result of our strategic transformation initiatives, including contract remediation and strategic contract actions, partially offset by the overall revenue decline. The Commercial Industries segment profit for 2016 as compared to the prior year was largely flat, primarily due to overall benefits from costs and productivity initiatives, partially offset by margin pressure in our customer care services offering and reduced project work in our litigation services offering.\nPublic Sector Segment\nRevenue\nPublic Sector revenue for 2017 as compared to prior year decreased, primarily driven by strategic decisions and contract losses in State & Local, Government Healthcare and Payment Services. Public Sector revenue for 2016 decreased as compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower volumes and lost business in State Government Services, partially offset by new business.\nSegment Profit\nDecrease in the Public Sector segment profit for 2017 as compared to the prior year was mainly due to strategic decisions, contract losses in Government Healthcare, as well as losses in our Payment Services business, partially mitigated by our strategic transformation initiative. Decrease in the Public Sector segment profit for 2016 as compared to prior year was primarily due to the impact of lost business in State Government Services, partially offset by costs and productivity initiatives and improved performance in our transportation offering.\nOther\nRevenue\nOther revenue for 2017 improved compared to 2016, primarily due to improved pricing and performance from two large Health Enterprise clients, partially offset by the exit from the NY MMIS contract and the strategic run-off of the Student Loan business. Other revenue for 2016 increased compared to 2015 as a result of the non-recurring $116 million HE charge in 2015, partially offset by the $83 million write-off of NY MMIS in 2016, the continued run-off of the Student Loan business, partially offset by our prior-year decision to not complete the HE implementations in California and Montana.\nSegment Loss\nOther loss for 2017 improved, primarily due to improved profitability in the student loan business, improved pricing from a contract extension with a large Health Enterprise client and general operational efficiencies in the HE business. Other loss for 2016 improved as a result of the non-recurring $389 million HE charge in 2015, partially offset by the $161 million write-off of the NY MMIS, partially offset by improvements in HE platform implementation expenses resulting from the decision to not fully complete the HE platform implementation in California and Montana.\nMetrics\nSignings\nSignings are defined as estimated future revenues from contracts signed during the period, including renewals of existing contracts. Total Contract Value (TCV) is the estimated total contractual revenue related to signed contracts. The amounts in the following table do not reflect the impact of our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard on January 1, 2018. Refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion of the estimated impact of the adoption of this standard.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 38\n\nSignings for 2017 decreased compared to the prior year mainly due to strategic decisions by management to streamline our portfolio which impacted both new business and renewal volume. Partially offsetting these declines were new business wins in targeted offerings and expansion with certain existing clients.\nSignings for 2016 decreased compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting lower contribution from new business, due in part to our decision not to pursue opportunities with lower margins and the prior year large NY MMIS new business signing.\nRenewal Rate\nRenewal rate is defined as the annual recurring revenue (ARR) on contracts that are renewed during the period as a percentage of ARR on all contracts for which a renewal decision was made during the period, excluding any contracts that were not renewed and where a strategic action to improve the risk or profitability had been initiated.\nExcluding our strategic decision not to renew certain contracts, renewal rate for 2017 was 94% and above our target range of 85%-90%. Including all contracts, renewals would have been 87%.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, total cash and cash equivalents were $658 million and $390 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, there were $1,574 million outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and we utilized $12 million of our revolving credit facility capacity to issue letters of credit. In addition, we will make payments in 2018 of $99 million to participants of the terminated deferred compensation plans.\nRefer to the Capital Market Activity section below for additional information regarding our capital activity.\nCash Flow Analysis\nThe following summarizes our cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2017, as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements:\n\nOperating Activities\nThe increase in cash generated from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to improvements in working capital and reduced wind-down payments associated with implementations in California, Montana and New York, partially offset by a higher interest payments on our outstanding debt.\nThe decrease in cash generated from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to reduced factoring, HE settlement payments and working capital partially offset by lower net income tax payments due to income tax refunds.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 39\nInvesting Activities\nThe increase in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily related to $117 million in proceeds received on the liquidation of investments related to the termination of the deferred compensation plan, $56 million of proceeds from the sale of business and assets as compared to payments of $54 million in 2016, $86 million of lower net additions to land, buildings and equipment, partially offset by non-recurring proceeds of $248 million on related party notes receivable in 2016.\nThe decrease in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily related to $54 million of payments for the sale of business and assets as compared to proceeds of $742 million in 2015, partially offset by proceeds of $248 million from related party notes receivable in 2016.\nFinancing Activities\nThe change to cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to cash provided by for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily related to a decrease of $1.7 billion in proceeds from long term debt and an increase in debt payments of $209 million, partially offset by a reduction in payments to former parent of $1.6 billion.\nThe change to cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to cash used for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily related to an increase of $1.9 billion in proceeds from long term debt and a reduction in payments on debt of $261 million, partially offset by an increase in payments to former parent of $957 million.\nCapital Market Activity\nIn April 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement, which reduced the interest rate on our Term Loan B by 1.5% from 5.5% over LIBOR to 4.0% over LIBOR. Subsequently in October 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 2, which reduced the interest rate on our Term Loan B by 1.0% from 4.0% over LIBOR to 3.0% over LIBOR.\nIn January 2017, we borrowed an additional $100 million on Term Loan B with proceeds used for general corporate purposes.\nRefer to Note 8 - Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFinancial Instruments\nRefer to Note 9 - Financial Instruments in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nContractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies\nAt December 31, 2017, we had the following contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies:\n\n_______________\n (1) Total debt represents principal debt and capital leases. Refer to Note 8 - Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt. \n (2) Represents interest on debt. Refer to Note 8 - Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n (3) Refer to Note 5 - Land, Buildings, Equipment and Software, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 40\n (4) Other purchase commitments: We enter into other purchase commitments with vendors in the ordinary course of business. Our policy with respect to all purchase commitments is to record losses, if any, when they are probable and reasonably estimable. We currently do not have, nor do we anticipate, material loss contracts.  Pension Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans that require periodic cash contributions. Our 2017 cash contributions for these plans were $8 million. In 2018, based on current actuarial calculations, we expect to make contributions of approximately $8 million to our worldwide defined benefit pension plans.\nContributions to our defined benefit pension plans in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors, including the investment performance of plan assets and discount rates as well as potential legislative and plan changes. At December 31, 2017, the unfunded and underfunded balances of our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $40 million and $19 million, respectively.\nRefer to Note 11 - Employee Benefit Plans in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding contributions to our defined benefit pension and post-retirement plans.\nOther Contingencies and Commitments\nAs more fully discussed in Note 13 - Contingencies and Litigation in the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning: securities law; governmental entity contracting, servicing and procurement law; intellectual property law; environmental law; employment law; the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA); and other laws and regulations. In addition, guarantees, indemnifications and claims may arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with suppliers, customers and non-consolidated affiliates. Nonperformance under a contract including a guarantee, indemnification or claim could trigger an obligation of the Company.\nWe determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. Should developments in any of these areas cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, we do not believe we have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nIn addition, refer to the preceding table for the Company's contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and Note 13 - Contingencies and Litigation in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding contingencies, guarantees, indemnifications and warranty liabilities.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have reported our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, we have discussed our results using the non-GAAP measures described below.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 41\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results. Accordingly, we believe it is necessary to adjust several reported amounts, determined in accordance with GAAP, to exclude the effects of certain items as well as their related tax effects. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the current periods' results against the corresponding prior periods' results. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable U.S. GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Conduent Incorporated. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. This MD&A provides additional information about our operations, current developments, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThroughout the MD&A, we refer to various notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements which appear in Item 8 of this 2017 Form 10-K, and the information contained in such notes is incorporated by reference into the MD&A in the places where such references are made.\nOverview\nWith revenues of $6.0 billion, we are a leading provider of business process services with expertise in transaction-intensive processing, analytics and automation. We serve as a trusted business partner in both the front office and back office, enabling personalized, seamless interactions on a massive scale that improve end-user experience.\nHeadquartered in Florham Park, New Jersey, we, have a team of approximately 90,000 people as of December 31, 2017, who serves customers in 31 countries. In 2017, 12% of our revenue was generated outside the U.S.\nOur reportable segments correspond to how we organize and manage the business and are aligned to the industries in which our clients operate.\nBeginning in 2017, in an effort to better reflect how we manage our business, we changed our reporting segments to align the Healthcare business based upon customer focus between Commercial Industries and Public Sector.\n \u2022 Commercial Industries - Our Commercial Industries segment provides business process services and customized solutions to clients in a variety of industries. Across the Commercial Industries segment, we deliver end-to-end business-to-business and business-to-customer services that enable our clients to optimize their key processes. Our multi-industry competencies include transaction processing, customer experience, human resource management, omni-channel communications and finance and accounting services. \n \u2022 Public Sector - Our Public Sector segment provides government-centric business process services to U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments for transportation, public assistance, program administration, transaction processing and payment services.  Other includes our Government HE Medicaid Platform business, where we are limiting our focus to maintaining systems for our current clients; our Education Business inclusive of our Student Loan business, which is in runoff; and inter-segment eliminations.\nSignificant 2017 Actions\nDispositions\nIn 2017, we completed divestitures of: (1) our Firehouse business and suite of emergency records management products used by fire departments across the country for their incident reporting and Emergency Management System information and records management; (2) our healthcare provider consulting services business, which advises healthcare organizations on IT application optimization; (3) the Breakaway Group business, which provides advisory project services to assist healthcare organizations optimize their health IT applications; (4) the mobile device management business of Wireless Data Services Limited; and (5) the Global Mobility business. The aggregate proceeds for these divestitures was $56 million in cash. The businesses sold represent $60 million and $82 million of 2017 and 2016 revenue, respectively. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $16 million on these divestitures for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 27\nIn addition, in 2017, we sold a property located in Dallas, Texas, which was formerly the Affiliated Computer Services (ACS) headquarters, for a pre-tax gain of $24 million. This was part of our effort to consolidate our real estate footprint.\nHealth Enterprise Settlement\nOn November 28, 2017, we entered into a definitive settlement agreement with the State of New York regarding resolution of the HE platform project. Under the terms of the settlement: (1) our contract with the State of New York terminated effective December 15, 2017 and we were released from all liabilities and obligations in connection with the contract at such time; and (2) we will pay, or incur costs on behalf of, the State of New York in the amount of approximately $20 million. As we have previously reserved this amount, we will incur no additional charges as a result of the settlement.\nSignificant 2016 Actions\nSeparation\nOn December 31, 2016, Conduent Incorporated spun-off from Xerox Corporation, pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement. The separation was completed by way of a pro rata distribution of Conduent Incorporated shares held by Xerox to Xerox's shareholders. As a result of the spin-off we operate as an independent, publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \"CNDT\".\nGoodwill Impairment Charge\nOur Commercial Industries reporting units operating results declined in 2016 versus our expectations, including a weak fourth quarter 2016. In performing our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined that the carrying value of the Commercial Industries reporting unit exceeded its fair value by 53%, which resulted in a goodwill impairment of $935 million. This has been presented as Goodwill impairment, a separate line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). Refer to Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nHealth Enterprise Charge\nIn February 2017, we determined that it was not probable that the New York Medicaid Management Information System (NY MMIS) project would be completed. As a result of this determination, we recorded a pre-tax charge (NY MMIS charge) of $161 million ($98 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2016. The charge included $83 million for the write-off of contract receivables which were recorded as a reduction of revenue and $78 million recorded in Cost of services including $36 million for wind-down costs, $28 million related to the non-cash charge for the impairment of software and $14 million for the write-off of deferred contract set-up and transition costs and other related assets and liabilities.\nSignificant 2015 Actions\nHealth Enterprise Charge\nIn 2015, we determined that we would not fully complete the HE platform implementation projects in California and Montana. However, we would continue to process Medicaid claims using existing legacy systems in those states, thus providing uninterrupted service for the states' healthcare providers and constituents.\nAs a result of this determination, we recorded a pre-tax HE charge of $389 million ($237 million after-tax). The charge included $116 million for the write-off of contract receivables (primarily non-current), $34 million related to the non-cash impairment of the HE software and deferred contract set-up transition costs and $23 million for other related assets and liabilities. The remainder of the charge was primarily related to settlement costs including payments to subcontractors resulting in cash outflows in future periods. Of the $389 million charge, $116 million was recorded as a reduction to revenue and the remaining $273 million recorded to Cost of services.\nThis development resulted from the Government Healthcare strategy change announced in July 2015, regarding our decision to focus our future HE implementations on current Medicaid customers and to discontinue investment in and sales of our Integrated Eligibility System. This resulted in a pre-tax non-cash software platform impairment charge of $146 million ($89 million after-tax).\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 28\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements giving due consideration to materiality. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies, estimates and related disclosures included herein with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We consider these as critical to understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements, as their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, since financial reporting results rely on estimates of the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. In instances where different estimates could have reasonably been used, we disclose the impact of these different estimates on our operations. In certain instances, the accounting rules are prescriptive; therefore, it would not have been possible to reasonably use different estimates. Changes in assumptions and estimates are reflected in the period in which they occur. The impact of such changes could be material to our results of operations and financial condition in any quarterly or annual period.\nSpecific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are discussed throughout the MD&A, where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nApplication of the various accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies.\nA significant portion of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria that do not require significant estimates or uncertainties. For example, transaction volumes, time and material and cost reimbursable arrangements are based on specific, objective criteria under the contracts. Accordingly, revenues recognized under these contracts do not require the use of significant estimates that are susceptible to change. Revenue recognized using the percentage-of completion (POC) accounting method does require the use of estimates and judgment as discussed below.\nWe recognize revenues when we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the services have been provided, the transaction price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. During 2017, approximately 80% of our revenue was recognized based on transaction volumes, approximately 13% was recognized on a fixed fee basis (wherein our revenue is earned as we fulfill our performance obligations under the arrangement), approximately 1% was related to cost reimbursable contracts, approximately 2% recognized using POC accounting and the remaining 4% was related to time and material contracts. Our revenue mix is subject to change due to the impact of changing customer requirements, acquisitions, divestitures, new business and lost business.\nPercentage-of-Completion: The POC method requires the use of estimates and judgment. Although not significant to total revenue, the POC methodology is normally applied to certain of our larger and longer term outsourcing contracts involving system development and implementation, primarily in government healthcare and certain government transportation contracts. In addition, we had unbilled receivables totaling $187 million and $279 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing revenues recognized but not yet billable under the terms of our POC contracts.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 29\nThe POC accounting methodology involves recognizing probable and reasonably estimable revenue using the percentage of services completed based on a current cumulative cost incurred to estimated total cost basis and a reasonably consistent profit margin over the period. Due to the long-term nature of these arrangements, developing the estimates of cost often requires significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include, but are not limited to, the availability of labor and labor productivity, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and the impact of delayed performance. If changes occur in delivery, productivity or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenues, we revise our cost and revenue estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in revenues. Such revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision become known. We perform ongoing profitability analysis of our POC services contracts in order to determine whether the latest estimates require updating. Key factors reviewed by the Company to estimate the future costs to complete each contract are future labor costs, future product costs, expected productivity efficiencies, achievement of contracted milestones and performance goals, as well as potential penalties for milestone and system implementation delays.\nIf at any time our estimates indicate the POC contract will be unprofitable, the entire estimated loss for the remainder of the contract is recorded immediately in cost of services. This results in the contract being recorded at a zero profit margin going forward with recognition of an equal amount of revenues and costs over the remaining contract term. A zero profit margin may also be applied when it is impractical to estimate specific amounts or ranges of contract revenues and costs; however, we can at least determine that we will not incur a loss on a particular contract.\nCapitalization of Outsourcing Contract Costs\nIn connection with our services arrangements, we incur and capitalize costs to originate these long-term contracts and to perform the migration, transition and setup activities necessary to enable us to perform under the terms of the arrangement. Certain initial direct costs of an arrangement are capitalized and amortized over the contractual service period of the arrangement to cost of services. From time to time, we also provide inducements to customers in various forms, including contractual credits, which are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the contract. We regularly review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Key estimates and assumptions that we must make include projecting future cash flows in order to assess the recoverability of deferred costs. To assess recoverability, undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining life and compared to the carrying amount of contract related assets, including the unamortized deferred cost balance. Key factors that are considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include projected labor costs and productivity efficiencies. A significant change in an estimate or assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nCapitalization of Software Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed after establishing technological feasibility, and we capitalize costs to develop or purchase internal-use software. Significant estimates and assumptions include: determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on estimated useful lives, estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. For commercial software products, determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products. We consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues, including an assessment of alternative solutions or products, current and historical demand for the product, and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete. For internal-use software, the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of our ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis. To assess the recoverability of capitalized software costs, we consider estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows. Such estimates require assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows, and are primarily based on the historical experience and expectations regarding future revenues. A significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations.\nRefer to Note 5 - Land, Buildings, Equipment and Software, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding capitalized software costs.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 30\nHeld for Sale\nWe classify assets as held for sale in the period when the following conditions are met: (i) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the asset (disposal group); (ii) the asset (disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (disposal group); (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset (disposal group) have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the asset (disposal group) is probable, and transfer of the asset (disposal group) is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond our control extend the period of time required to sell the asset (disposal group) beyond one year; (v) the asset (disposal group) is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (vi) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\nA long-lived asset (disposal group) that is classified as held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a long-lived asset (disposal group) until the date of sale.\nThe fair value of a long-lived asset (disposal group) less any costs to sell is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and any subsequent changes are reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset (disposal group), as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the asset at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. Upon determining that a long-lived asset (disposal group) meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group in the line items Assets held for sale and Liabilities held for sale, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, management approved the disposal through sale of certain assets and businesses, which is a mix of both Commercial Industries and Public Sectors. This action was taken as a result of our evaluation of these businesses as they represent businesses in markets or with services that we did not see as strategic or core. As of December 31, 2017, these businesses qualified as assets held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we reclassified $757 million to assets held for sale and $169 million to liabilities held for sale, as we have an active program to locate buyers for these businesses and we expect these businesses to be sold within one year.\nIntangible Assets\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily estimated using an income approach. These estimates include market participant assumptions and require projected financial information, including assumptions about future revenue growth and costs necessary to facilitate the projected growth. Other key inputs include assumptions about technological obsolescence, customer attrition rates, brand recognition, the allocation of projected cash flows to identifiable intangible assets and discount rates. We regularly review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following:\n \u2022 significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; \n \u2022 significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; and \n \u2022 significant negative industry or economic trends.  When we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of potential impairment, we assess whether an impairment has occurred based on whether net book value of the assets exceeds the related projected undiscounted cash flows from these assets. We consider a number of factors, including past operating results, budgets, economic projections, market trends and product development cycles in estimating future cash flows. Differing estimates and assumptions as to any of the factors described above could result in a materially different impairment charge, if any, and thus materially different results of operations.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if an event or circumstance indicates that impairment may have been incurred. Events or circumstances that might indicate an interim evaluation is warranted include, among other things, unexpected adverse business conditions, macro and reporting unit specific economic factors, supply costs, unanticipated competitive activities and acts by governments and courts.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 31\nApplication of the annual goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the assessment of the fair value of each reporting unit. We determined that our reporting units were the same as our operating segments and, therefore, our business is comprised of two reporting units. Our annual quantitative impairment test of goodwill was performed in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIn our quantitative test, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit by weighting the results from the income approach (discounted cash flow methodology) and market approach. These valuation approaches require significant judgment and consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. In addition, we are required to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the current economic environment, industry factors and the future profitability of our businesses.\nWhen performing our discounted cash flow analysis for each reporting unit, we incorporate the use of projected financial information and discount rates that are developed using market participant-based assumptions. The cash-flow projections are based on three-year financial forecasts developed by management that include revenue and expense projections, restructuring and strategic transformation activities, capital spending trends and investment in working capital to support anticipated revenue growth or other changes in the business. The selected discount rates consider the risk and nature of the respective reporting units' cash flows, appropriate capital structure and rates of return that market participants would require to invest their capital in our reporting units.\nWe believe these assumptions are appropriate and reflect our forecasted long-term business model and give appropriate consideration to our historical results as well as the current economic environment and markets that we serve.\nBased on our quantitative assessments, we concluded that the fair value of our Commercial Industries and Public Sector reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by 72% and 13%, respectively, at December 31, 2017. The most significant assumptions used in the goodwill analysis relate to a 3% long-term organic growth rate for both the Commercial Industries and Public Sector segments as well as a 9.25% and a 8.75% discount rate for the Commercial Industries and Public Sector segments, respectively. The fair values of the Commercial Industries and Public Sector segments are sensitive to changes in the long-term growth rates and the discount rates. A decrease of 50 basis points to the long-term growth rate or an increase to the discount rate of 50 basis points would result in an approximate reduction of fair value of $200 million and $250 million, respectively, in the Public Sector segment.\nRefer to Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding goodwill by reportable segment.\nRestructuring and Asset Impairments\nWe have engaged in restructuring actions, which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction, the fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the lease cancellation and other exit costs. We accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements.\nFor additional information regarding our restructuring actions, refer to the \"Restructuring and Related Costs\" section in the MD&A and Note 7 - Restructuring Programs and Asset Impairment Charges in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our provision is based on nonrecurring events as well as recurring factors, including the taxation of foreign income. In addition, our provision will change based on discrete or other nonrecurring events such as audit settlements, tax law changes, changes in valuation allowances and other factors, that may not be predictable. In the event that there is a significant unusual or one-time item recognized in our operating results, the taxes attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as an unusual or one-time item.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 32\nWe record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and provide valuation allowances as required. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Gross deferred tax assets of $250 million and $360 million had valuation allowances of $35 million and $24 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a result of the 2017 tax law changes in the United States, we recorded provisional amounts for a one-time non-cash $210 million income tax benefit related to adjusting our deferred tax liabilities from a 35% Federal tax rate to a 21% Federal tax rate and the transition tax expense of $12 million.\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. Accordingly, we may incur additional tax expense based upon our assessment of the more-likely-than-not outcomes of such matters. In addition, when applicable, we adjust previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results. Our ongoing assessments of the more-likely-than-not outcomes of examinations and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax rate, as well as impact our operating results. Unrecognized tax benefits were $15 million, $14 million and $24 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nRefer to Note 12 - Income Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding deferred income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure considering all available information including, but not limited to, the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular matter. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation, and may revise estimates. These revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on the results of operations and financial position.\nRefer to Note 13 - Contingencies and Litigation in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding loss contingencies.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 33\nFinancial Information\nFinancial information for the three years ended

strategic decisions by management as part of our portfolio rationalization, including exiting certain unprofitable contracts, the run-off of our Student Loan business and contract losses. Partially offsetting these declines was an increase from the ramping of new business.\nTotal revenues for 2016 decreased compared to the prior year as a result of the NY MMIS charge of $83 million, lower volumes, delayed ramping of new business and contract exits, primarily in customer care contracts within our Commercial Industries segment, the run off of our Student Loan business and overall price declines that were consistent with prior-period trends. Partially offsetting these declines were new contracts in the Public Sector.\nCost of Services\nCost of services for 2017 decreased compared to the prior year period primarily due to cost transformation, lost business, wind-down of the NY MMIS contract, run-off of our Student Loan business, strategic contract actions taken by management as part of portfolio management and lower volumes.\nCost of services for 2016 decreased compared to the prior year period primarily due to lost business, the NY MMIS contract, run-off of our Student Loan business and lower volumes.\nGross Margin\nIncrease in gross margin in 2017 compared to the prior year period was driven primarily by the impact of cost and productivity improvements, including benefits from our strategic transformation program, exiting or remediating certain underperforming contracts and lower costs associated with our Student Loan business. This was partially offset by the run-off of our Student Loan business, contract losses and lower volumes with existing clients.\nIncrease in gross margin in 2016 compared to the prior year period reflected cost benefits from our strategic transformation initiatives offset by lost business and margin pressures in our customer service offerings and price declines.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 34\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A)\nLower SG&A compared to the prior years reflected the impact of our strategic transformation initiatives driving lower wages and benefits, partially offset by the expansion and investment in our sales force.\nRestructuring and Related Costs\nRestructuring and related costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 include $46 million of lease cancellation costs as part of our effort to consolidate our real estate footprint, $41 million of severance costs due to headcount reductions of approximately 3,200 employees worldwide, $9 million of costs primarily related to professional support services associated with the implementation of the strategic transformation program and $5 million of asset impairments charges.\nRestructuring and related costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 include $54 million of severance costs due to headcount reductions of approximately 3,600 employees worldwide, $28 million of costs primarily related to professional support services associated with the implementation of the strategic transformation program, $12 million of asset impairment charges and $7 million of lease cancellation costs.\nRefer to Note 7 - Restructuring Programs and Asset Impairment Charges in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring programs.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible asset decreased in 2017 from the prior year primarily due to the acceleration of amortization of certain trade-names in 2016.\nAmortization of intangible assets was higher in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to the acceleration of amortization of certain trade-names associated with prior acquisitions.\nRefer to Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our intangible assets.\nGoodwill Impairment\nOur Commercial Industries reporting unit experienced declining operating results in 2016 versus expectations. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $935 million. Refer to Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Goodwill impairment charge.\nSeparation Costs\nSeparation costs are primarily for third-party investment banking, accounting, legal, consulting and other similar types of services related to the separation transaction as well as costs associated with the operational separation of the two companies, such as those related to human resources, brand management, real estate and information management to the extent not capitalized. Separation costs also include the costs associated with bonuses and restricted stock grants awarded to employees for retention through the separation.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense represents interest on long-term debt and the amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased compared to the prior year, primarily due to the issuance of debt with the capitalization of the Company during the spin-off in December 2016 and subsequent borrowing under Term Loan B in January 2017, as well as amounts outstanding at various times throughout the year under the Company's credit facility.\nIn 2017, the Company successfully repriced its Term Loan B in April and October (Amendments No.1 and No. 2, respectively), which overall resulted in lowering the total interest rate on this loan by 250 basis points to LIBOR plus 3.0%.\nRefer to Note 8 - Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 35\nRelated Party Interest\nIn January 2017, in connection with the spin-off from Xerox Corporation, we paid Xerox $161 million for the final settlement per the Separation and Distribution Agreement.\nRelated-party interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was lower than the prior year primarily due to the payment of certain related party notes payable in 2015, as a result of the proceeds received from the sale of the ITO business.\nRefer to Note 18 - Related Party Transactions and Former Parent Company Investment in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n(Gain) Loss on Sale of Asset\nAs disclosed under Item 7. MD&A- Divestiture, we completed five divestitures in 2017 with aggregate proceeds of $56 million. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $16 million on these divestitures. In addition, in 2017 we sold a property located in Dallas, TX, which was formerly the ACS headquarters, for a pre-tax gain of $24 million.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nOther (income) expense, net primarily includes foreign currency transaction losses (gains), litigation and other contingent matters and deferred compensation investment results.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) was enacted. The effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. In the case of US federal income taxes, the enactment date is the date the bill becomes law. The income tax effects of the Tax Reform have been initially accounted for on a provisional basis pursuant to the SEC staff guidance on income taxes. Reasonable estimates for all material tax effects of the Tax Reform have been provided and adjustments to provisional amounts will be made in subsequent reporting periods as information becomes available to complete provisional computations.\nThe 2017 effective tax rate was 1,206.3% as compared with 19.9% for the prior year. The 2017 rate was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of the Tax Reform, which included the reduction of the U.S. statutory rate from 35% to 21% and a one-time tax on undistributed and previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits. Excluding primarily the tax impact of the Tax Reform, the termination of the COLI, amortization of intangible assets and gains on U.S divestitures, the adjusted effective tax rate for 2017 was 33.8%. The Tax Reform is the most significant change to U.S. federal income tax legislation in over 30 years and, as a result, has a disproportionate effect on our 2017 effective tax rate. See Note 12 - Income Taxes for further information regarding the impact of the Tax Reform on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using the enacted tax rates for the periods during which the related temporary differences are expected to reverse or deferred tax attributes are expected to be realized. As a result of the change in future federal statutory tax rate due to the passing of the Tax Reform, the deferred tax assets and liabilities should no longer be valued at a federal statutory rate of 35%, but rather at the rate in which the benefit of the deferred tax liabilities will be realized by the Company. As such, the U.S. federal statutory rate used to value the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities was 21%, which resulted in a $210 million tax benefit.\nThe 2016 effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate due primarily to the impact of the non-deductible Goodwill impairment charge. Excluding primarily the goodwill impairment, NY MMIS, amortization of intangible assets, and restructuring costs, the 2016 normalized effective rate was 29.0%.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 36\nOperations Review of Segments\nOur reportable segments correspond to how we organize and manage the business and are aligned to the industries in which our clients operate. Beginning in 2017, in an effort to better reflect how we organize and manage our business, we changed our reporting segments to align the Healthcare business based on customer focus between Commercial Industries and Public Sector.

the reconciliations table in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section. \nCommercial Industries Segment\nRevenue\nCommercial Industries revenue 2017 as compared to prior year decreased, primarily driven by strategic contract actions, lower volumes in our customer care offerings and lost business, partially offset by revenue from new contracts and price increases with existing clients. Commercial Industries revenue for 2016 decreased from the prior year, mainly driven by lost business, lower volumes in our customer care offerings and reduced level of project work as a result of fewer large cases in our litigation services offering, negative impacts from currency and strategic contract exits. Partially offsetting the decline were new contract signings, primarily in our high-tech business area.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 37\nSegment Profit\nIncrease in the Commercial Industries segment profit for 2017 as compared to the prior year, was primarily driven by reduced costs as a result of our strategic transformation initiatives, including contract remediation and strategic contract actions, partially offset by the overall revenue decline. The Commercial Industries segment profit for 2016 as compared to the prior year was largely flat, primarily due to overall benefits from costs and productivity initiatives, partially offset by margin pressure in our customer care services offering and reduced project work in our litigation services offering.\nPublic Sector Segment\nRevenue\nPublic Sector revenue for 2017 as compared to prior year decreased, primarily driven by strategic decisions and contract losses in State & Local, Government Healthcare and Payment Services. Public Sector revenue for 2016 decreased as compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower volumes and lost business in State Government Services, partially offset by new business.\nSegment Profit\nDecrease in the Public Sector segment profit for 2017 as compared to the prior year was mainly due to strategic decisions, contract losses in Government Healthcare, as well as losses in our Payment Services business, partially mitigated by our strategic transformation initiative. Decrease in the Public Sector segment profit for 2016 as compared to prior year was primarily due to the impact of lost business in State Government Services, partially offset by costs and productivity initiatives and improved performance in our transportation offering.\nOther\nRevenue\nOther revenue for 2017 improved compared to 2016, primarily due to improved pricing and performance from two large Health Enterprise clients, partially offset by the exit from the NY MMIS contract and the strategic run-off of the Student Loan business. Other revenue for 2016 increased compared to 2015 as a result of the non-recurring $116 million HE charge in 2015, partially offset by the $83 million write-off of NY MMIS in 2016, the continued run-off of the Student Loan business, partially offset by our prior-year decision to not complete the HE implementations in California and Montana.\nSegment Loss\nOther loss for 2017 improved, primarily due to improved profitability in the student loan business, improved pricing from a contract extension with a large Health Enterprise client and general operational efficiencies in the HE business. Other loss for 2016 improved as a result of the non-recurring $389 million HE charge in 2015, partially offset by the $161 million write-off of the NY MMIS, partially offset by improvements in HE platform implementation expenses resulting from the decision to not fully complete the HE platform implementation in California and Montana.\nMetrics\nSignings\nSignings are defined as estimated future revenues from contracts signed during the period, including renewals of existing contracts. Total Contract Value (TCV) is the estimated total contractual revenue related to signed contracts.

Partially offsetting these declines were new business wins in targeted offerings and expansion with certain existing clients.\nSignings for 2016 decreased compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting lower contribution from new business, due in part to our decision not to pursue opportunities with lower margins and the prior year large NY MMIS new business signing.\nRenewal Rate\nRenewal rate is defined as the annual recurring revenue (ARR) on contracts that are renewed during the period as a percentage of ARR on all contracts for which a renewal decision was made during the period, excluding any contracts that were not renewed and where a strategic action to improve the risk or profitability had been initiated.\nExcluding our strategic decision not to renew certain contracts, renewal rate for 2017 was 94% and above our target range of 85%-90%. Including all contracts, renewals would have been 87%.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, total cash and cash equivalents were $658 million and $390 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, there were $1,574 million outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and we utilized $12 million of our revolving credit facility capacity to issue letters of credit. In addition, we will make payments in 2018 of $99 million to participants of the terminated deferred compensation plans.\nRefer to the Capital Market Activity section below for additional information regarding our capital activity.\nCash Flow Analysis\nThe following summarizes our cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2017, as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(385\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(506\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>(109\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,023\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(241\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe increase in cash generated from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to improvements in working capital and reduced wind-down payments associated with implementations in California, Montana and New York, partially offset by a higher interest payments on our outstanding debt.\nThe decrease in cash generated from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to reduced factoring, HE settlement payments and working capital partially offset by lower net income tax payments due to income tax refunds.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 39\nInvesting Activities\nThe increase in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily related to $117 million in proceeds received on the liquidation of investments related to the termination of the deferred compensation plan, $56 million of proceeds from the sale of business and assets as compared to payments of $54 million in 2016, $86 million of lower net additions to land, buildings and equipment, partially offset by non-recurring proceeds of $248 million on related party notes receivable in 2016.\nThe decrease in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily related to $54 million of payments for the sale of business and assets as compared to proceeds of $742 million in 2015, partially offset by proceeds of $248 million from related party notes receivable in 2016.\nFinancing Activities\nThe change to cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to cash provided by for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily related to a decrease of $1.7 billion in proceeds from long term debt and an increase in debt payments of $209 million, partially offset by a reduction in payments to former parent of $1.6 billion.\nThe change to cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to cash used for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily related to an increase of $1.9 billion in proceeds from long term debt and a reduction in payments on debt of $261 million, partially offset by an increase in payments to former parent of $957 million.\nCapital Market Activity\nIn April 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement, which reduced the interest rate on our Term Loan B by 1.5% from 5.5% over LIBOR to 4.0% over LIBOR. Subsequently in October 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 2, which reduced the interest rate on our Term Loan B by 1.0% from 4.0% over LIBOR to 3.0% over LIBOR.\nIn January 2017, we borrowed an additional $100 million on Term Loan B with proceeds used for general corporate purposes.\nRefer to Note 8 - Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFinancial Instruments\nRefer to Note 9 - Financial Instruments in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nContractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies\nAt December 31, 2017, we had the following contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt, including capital lease obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on debt(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum operating lease commitments(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Defined benefit pension plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated Purchase Commitments(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n (1) Total debt represents principal debt and capital leases.

Our policy with respect to all purchase commitments is to record losses, if any, when they are probable and reasonably estimable. We currently do not have, nor do we anticipate, material loss contracts.  Pension Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans that require periodic cash contributions. Our 2017 cash contributions for these plans were $8 million. In 2018, based on current actuarial calculations, we expect to make contributions of approximately $8 million to our worldwide defined benefit pension plans.\nContributions to our defined benefit pension plans in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors, including the investment performance of plan assets and discount rates as well as potential legislative and plan changes. At December 31, 2017, the unfunded and underfunded balances of our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $40 million and $19 million, respectively.\nRefer to Note 11 - Employee Benefit Plans in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding contributions to our defined benefit pension and post-retirement plans.\nOther Contingencies and Commitments\nAs more fully discussed in Note 13 - Contingencies and Litigation in the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning: securities law; governmental entity contracting, servicing and procurement law; intellectual property law; environmental law; employment law; the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA); and other laws and regulations. In addition, guarantees, indemnifications and claims may arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with suppliers, customers and non-consolidated affiliates. Nonperformance under a contract including a guarantee, indemnification or claim could trigger an obligation of the Company.\nWe determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. Should developments in any of these areas cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, we do not believe we have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nIn addition, refer to the preceding table for the Company's contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and Note 13 - Contingencies and Litigation in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding contingencies, guarantees, indemnifications and warranty liabilities.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have reported our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, we have discussed our results using the non-GAAP measures described below.\nConduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report 41\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results. Accordingly, we believe it is necessary to adjust several reported amounts, determined in accordance with GAAP, to exclude the effects of certain items as well as their related tax effects. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the current periods' results against the corresponding prior periods' results. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable U.S. GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating"}
